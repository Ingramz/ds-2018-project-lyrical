Marlene Dietrich,"You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me

Let me live 'neath your spell
*You* do that voodoo that you do so well

For you do something to me
That nobody else could do.

Let me live 'neath your spell

For you do something to me
That nobody else could do

That nobody else could do",You Do Something to Me,1995
Marlene Dietrich,"See what the boys in the backroom will have
And tell them I'm having the same
Go see what the boys in the backroom will have
And give them the poison they name

And when I die don't spend my money
On flowers and my picture in a frame

[Chorus]
Just see what the boys in the backroom will have
And tell them I sighed and tell them I cried
And tell them I died of the same

Marlene Dietrich,"Too old, too old, he's too old
To cut the mustard anymore.

Well, when I was young I had a lotta pep
I could get around I didn't need no help
But since I'm old and a gettin' gray
The people all look at me and say.

Too old, too old, he's too old
To cut the mustard anymore
Buddy's gettin' too old, Buck's done got too old
He's too old to cut the mustard anymore.

I used to could, jump just like a deer
Now I need a new landing gear
I used to could, jump a picket fence
But now I'm lucky if I jump an inch.

Too old, too old, he's too old
To cut the mustard anymore
Buddy's gettin' too old, Buck's done got too old
He's too old to cut the mustard anymore.

Well, when I was young I had an automobile
Scoot myself right under the wheel
I had to fight the gals off with a stick
But now they say he makes me sick.

Too old, too old, he's too old
To cut the mustard anymore
Buddy's gettin' too old, Buck's done got too old
He's too old to cut the mustard anymore.

Marlene Dietrich,"Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
I never saw a good one yet
Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
And if you love 'em nothin's what you'll get

He will swear he's seeking
Your love for ever more
And then he comes home reeking
Of perfume you never wore

You'll maybe wanna shoot him
But he isn't worth the shot
And you can bet the other woman
Has found out he's not so hot

Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
I never saw a good one yet
Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
And if you love 'em nothin's what you'll get

He says he'll surprise you
With diamonds and with mink
But the only things he buys you
Are a wringer and a sink

He may be full of glamour
At the opera in a box
But he ain't so darned attractive
When you're washin' out his socks

Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
I never saw a good one yet
Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
And if you love 'em nothin's what you'll get

Their wiley arts, their tender pleas
Their fickle hearts, their knobby knees

Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
A girl who's smart will leave `em be.
Good for nothin'
Men are good for nothin'
But can we do without 'em, No Sir-eee
But can we do without 'em, No sir-eee",Good for Nothin',1997

Marlene Dietrich,"I've been in love before, it's true
Been learning to adore just you
Some old woman taught me how to kiss
To smile like that, to sigh like this

I've been in love before, you'll see
Oh darling, what a bore I'd be
My past that makes you hate me
Makes you love me too
I've been in love before, never knew

Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2008
Marlene VerPlanck,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Marley Marl,"Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""a"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like caruso
Sleep if ya want to, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (yo, I believe that's me)
Craig g, light up the mic for the symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the juice crew
You said, ""mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'cause if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, 'cause on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up(yo, I believe that's me)
Cool g rap, light up the mic for the symphony

Yo, marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When g rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and want to sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'cause I put out more lights in a fight than con edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though, solo, 'cause you're still all soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, g rap wrecks, he's rated x, to mean the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused, pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up (i believe that's me)
Big daddy kane, get on the mic for the symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'cause rockin' a party? yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution, I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
'cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, 'cause daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'cause when it comes to money, yo, grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, mcs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge, don't barge, 'cause gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin, so put kane in, that category, period, end of story",The Symphony,1988
Marley Marl,"Yeah 
(To da break of dawn) 
All my sex involved 
As we get funky 
Rhymes so bizarre 
Everybody knows 
When it come to a situation like this 
Little more effects 
And I can't resist 
So we get funky in the house 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
L.L. Cool J style 
What? 
This ain't on a pop tip 
Check it out 
 
What is a panther? A animal that kills 
I'm like a shark with blood comin' out the gills 
You could never in your wildest dreams 
Get a piece of this gangsta, lean, straight from Queens 
Strong as liquor, to be seen in a limousine 
Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline 
Wouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow 
Made another million, so competitors bow 
Homeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong 
Nothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong?
Songs that ain't strong, brother, you're dead wrong 
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on 
Ha, you can't handle the whole weight 
Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate 
Wise up you little burnt-up french fry 
I'm that type of guy 
And I slammed you know, just like a sumo 
Put him in pampers, leave my drawers in his hamper 
When I'm through, you need a brand-new identity 
I was scoopin' girls before you lost your virginity 
Your jam is just a dreamin' MC scheme 
gettin' crushed by a L.L. theme 
somethin' like Shaft, put you in a cask', bo! 
You little blood-clot boy, you must not know 
The rep I keep, the MC's I peep, sweep, play cheap 
And freak with a chic, unique technique 
Get rid of the yuk-mouth smile 
'Cause brother, you ain't got no style 

Keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 
(To the break of dawn) 
Yeah 
Keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 
Hey yo, that's kinda funky 
But check this out here 
(Rock that shit) 
(To the break of dawn) 
Yeah

Immaculate styles, I used to abuse 
MC's, so light the fuse 
And spread the news, you lose 
To the damager, microphone manager 
Cold crush, and bruise, and bandage a amateur 
That amateur, swingin' a hammer 
From a body bag, so run and get your camera 
Get a flick of the stiff dead-shot to get swift 
But I'm the wrong brother to dance with 
'Cause I don't need a partner to swing 
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring 
shootin' the gift, but you just don't shoot it right 
You couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight 
Wouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town 
So don't try to play post, clown 
You know the L.L.'s back in town 
And all the want-to-be sherrifs is gettin' shot down 
Gimme that microphone 
I'm a show you the real meaning of the danger zone 
Stop dancin', get to walkin'
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin'
Huh, you little snake in the grass 
You swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass 
Gimme a lighter, woof! 
Now you're cut loose 
From that Jheri curl juice 
Cool J is back on the map 
And when I see ya, I'm a give you a slap 
That's right, a little kick for that crap 
'Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap 

Keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 
Yeah 
(To the break of dawn) 
Funk it up 
I said keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 
(Yo, rock that shit) 
(To the break of dawn) 
Check this out 
Yeah

How dare you stand beside me?
I'm Cool, I freeze I-C-E 
On your trail, and I'm a cut that bull tail 
You're disobedient with the wrong ingredients 
But I'm a drink you down over the rocks 
While I freak on your album cover jocks 
You're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon 
I took the cover right home to the bathroom 
In the immortal words of L.L., 'hard as hell' 
Your broad wears it well 
She's the reason that your record sold a few copies 
But your rhymes are sloppy 
Like Oscar, and you're bound to get dropped 
And stopped, I ain't Murray the cop 
Nor am I Felix, but I got a bag of tricks 
Mr. Pusherman, gimme a fix 
So I can show you I'm immune to them Romper Room tunes 
You little hip-hop racoon 
I'm not Scarface, but I want more beef 
Before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief 
Workin' in a parking lot 
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned 
So tell me how you like your coat, cream? 
On a cone, in a bowl, or in a wet dream? 
With your tv on channel fuzz 
Uncle L, that's how much damage he does 
Here's five dollars, catch a taxi cab 
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab 

Keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 
Yeah 
(To the break of dawn) 
I say keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 

Just wanted to funk it up a little bit 
My man Pete Rock is up in the crib 
You know what I'm sayin'?
Over here at Marley Marl house 
Just coolin' out 
My man Clash in the house 
Sippin' on this Bartles and Jaymes premium piece flavor out the cooler 
Loungin' back 
Keep on

When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad 

My rhymes start to flow  so I simply must brag 

About my style that makes you vibrant  I keep drivin

For any sucker rapper that chooses to come 

And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin

Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo 

Or the things Marley does in the studio? 

I drop science as if I was Butterfingers 

And I know there's not another singer 

In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme 

Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine 

And when it comes to havin showmanship 

I really don't care who you go and get

For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare 

These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit 

And sized perfectly, so that they can fit 

You're steppin to us? You need traction 

Or you'll be another sucker missin in action 

You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it

Your hoe, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around

Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth

When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad 

My rhymes start to flow  so I simply must brag 

About my style that makes you vibrant  I keep drivin 

Until the song turns me to a hip hop giant 

Me and Marley Marl  we're goin one on one 

For any sucker rapper that chooses to come 

And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin 

I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing? 

They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip

Why am I best in this profession? 

Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo 

Or the things Marley does in the studio? 

I drop science as if I was Butterfingers 

And I know there's not another singer 

In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme 

Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine 

And when it comes to havin showmanship 

I really don't care who you go and get

Too much lies  corruption and scandal

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless?

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip

Some kind of challenge? I take you head up
Beat up and eat up punks and won't let up
But not with my fist or even with a deadly weapon
But with my lyrics, yeah, that's how I'm steppin
On all those that doubt me or my race is won
And you critics are hopin that the Ace is done
But now consider, this here little bit of
Super commentary for those that are very
Misdirected and lookin for some kinda angle
Censorship is their attempt to strangle
The Master, they know that my words can motivate
And set straight the crooked from their fate
Don't you understand that rap is like a tool to me
You're sellin what? You're actin likea fool to me
Go get a job or maybe go and learn a trade
And make the grade, that's how you get paid
Steady's on the cut and Action is the posse
Open your eyes and you'll see what I see

Themselves independent, but yo, we're all in
The same boat together, it doesn't matter whether
You disagree, it's still reality - see

Now where're we goin, where are we goin, which direction?
Look at your reflection, now someone praise the resurrection
Of a people many years considered kin
To an animal, unlike those with lighter skin
But that's the past and many knew it couldn't last
By peaceful means or either by a rifle blast
Or whatever, better late than never
We finally arrived and yo, the dream has survived
But many died tryin and they're the ones that paved the way
Real live supermen and -women save the day
So that we can live our life without ?????

So realize what it took for us to rise
And don't sleep but reap and keep your eyes on the prize

Cause somebody is gettin paid
I think it's time to sprinkle some rain on the parade
Now listen, take this as a word from the wise
I'm not a prophet or a preacher, just a man with eyes
And I've been witnessed the fitness of a neighborhood worsen
You oughta hold a person-to-person
Discussion with those who rose from that level
Usin a broom or a mop or a shovel
Not on the corner waitin for the big pay-off
It's not comin, so why not stay off
The streets, believe me it beats bein sent up-
state on a date with the man and bein pinned up
In solitary, take advantage of your freedom
I'm givin helpful hands cause you need em
It's not all about the cash you make
Sellin poison to boys and girls - you're a fake
So what you got a cable, so what you got a BM?
You love when the girls go, ""Ooh, did you see him!""
So what your pocket's filled with 20s and 10s
You're gonna find out just how fast that ends
Cause one day you'll be drivin round the way in your ride
There'll be a bullet with your name on the side
And if you don't believe what I'm tellin you, mack
When you're layin on the ground with a hole in your back
Lookin up at the sky, gettin closer to hell

So take your places and listen to the rhymin as
I like display a new style that just may
Leave suckers runnin for the door in total dismay
Yeah, by now, so you're startin to
Get a little hype, but first get a partner
And proceed full speed right to the dance arena
I really doubt it, but maybe by chance you seen 
another brother more inclined to play the part of Simon
Than the Master Ace who knows the art of rhymin
Like a shark knows the finer points of swimmin
Like Steady Pace know the cuts and the fly women
And so before we start this game
Simon says: get up, and yo, I do the same

(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: look deep into your partner's eyes
(Let's play a little game)
Look at your partner from head to toe
(Let's play a little game)
And all those good parts in between, you know
(Let's play a little game)

Simon says: it gets badder, and you never had a
Beat that can heat your feet, and still add a
Theme with so much steam, it makes sweat pour
From your faces, and the Ace is sure
Gonna do it, as you listen to it
See, I navigate ya straight to help through it
I'm Simon, rhymin, climbin on time, and
On a mission, that's the position that I'm in
Takin you there, makin you care
I'm achin to tear up the floor, but I don't dare
Leave the mic sittin, gettin cold without my hand on
Those that dance don't have a foot to stand on
And those that don't dance, yo, you oughta know
Simon says: wall flowers aren't allowed to grow

(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: close your eyes
And imagine your partner totally unclothed
(Let's play a little game)
Nude, in the butt, bare to the flesh
Now get as close as you can to your partner
And without touching him, move your body to the rhythm
(Let's play a little game)

Simon takes the stand, just as planned
And I display in a ray that's rather grand
Now I agree, there are many who said 'party's off'
But if one of them says, he drops arty soft
See to drop hard you must have the kind of mind
That's refined and artistically lined
Cause yo, it takes nack if you want to attack
Attract with such skill, and still fit the bill
Ace and Action, few can come harder
Than we come, uhm - here's some, but only part of
The gift that can lift the myth that is swift
Only boast the most, yo, Simon says
If your partner's face is in place with your taste
Then haste, you better push up, no time to waste
So if you're with it, you better get it, don't try to sit it
On a chair and stare like a square, brother, quit it
There's no time for nerds and geeks, only freaks
With the sexy cheeks, as the Master speaks
And for weeks and weeks you will dance and prance
To the rhythm I enhance with my chants
So here's a glance at a jam that'll nullify
And fry all the rest, bust the color
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, in the gold and violet
This jam is fly, and I'm the pilot
Flyin you straight to the end of the rainbow
Steady and I try to open your brain, so
You can accept what was carefully kept
Till the fun stops, then the party was pepped
Up, and if you stepped up, you couldn't hold your place in a chair
So hail Simon, the brother Master Ace in the rear

Simon says: yeah

Now Simon says: put your right hand on your partner's shoulder
And put your left hand on your partner's waist

You cats spit raps that are not believable
Your raps don't bubble 'cause they're inconceivable
Real life O.G.'s don't even speak to you
In hip-hop's culture there's really no need for you

I'll bring the heat to you, when it comes to them glocks
Like Freddie Foxxx, I'm keepin two
I'm known for my scary feuds
That's why I'm called The Terrorist by the Daily News

I rarely lose, I'm known to rattle a cage
I'm known to throw rappers off the stage
Maybe it's a matter of age
But as a MC I got no patience for some rappers these days

I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool
(Yeah, I'll say it)
I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool

I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool

If you bumpin' KRS, then you bumpin' the raw

Old skool, new skool, we rocked both of them

Marley Marl, he produced both of them
We supposed to win, guest lists, V.I.P.
Backstage passes when we rollin' in

For all a y'all, just enjoy yourself
Makin' your own job, employ yourself

Don't destroy yourself and don't be fooled

Let's go, I come back, every year I get brighter

Let's go, I come back, every year I'm expandin'
Talkin' to developers about this city we plannin', c'mon
I come back through any endeavor
This is hip hop, we gon? last forever

Hip means to know, it's a form of intelligence
To be hip is to be update and relevant
Hop is a form of movement
You can't just observe a hop, you gotta hop up and do it

Hip and hop is more than music
Hip is the knowledge, hop is the movement
Hip and Hop is intelligent movement
Or relevant movement we sellin? the music

So write this down on your black books and journals
Hip hop culture is eternal
Run and tell all your friends
An ancient civilization has bee born again, it's a fact

I come back, every year I'm the strongest
KRS-One, Marley Marl, yup, we last the longest
Let's go, I come back ?cause I'm not in the physical
I create myself, man, I live in the spiritual

I come back through the cycles of life
If you been here once you gon? be here twice
So I tell you, I come back ?cause you must learn too
Hip hop culture is eternal

Hip hop, her infinite power
Helpin' oppressed people, we are unique and unequaled
Hip hop, holy integrated people
Havin' omnipresent power, the watchman's in the tower of

Hip hop, hydrogen iodine phosphorous
Hydrogen oxygen phosphorous, that's called
Hip hop, the response of cosmic consciousness
To our condition as hip hop

We gotta think about the children we bringin' up
When hip and hop means intelligence springin' up
We singin' what? Sickness, hatred, ignorance and poverty
Or health, love, awareness and health, follow me

I come back, every year I get newer
I'm the dust on the moon, I'm the trash in the sewer, that's right
I come back, every year I get brighter
If you think hip hop is alive hold up your lighter, let's go

I come back, every year I'm expandin'
Talkin' to developers about this city we plannin'
I come back through any endeavor
This hip hop we gon? last forever

We will be here forever
We will still be here forever
Get what I'm sayin' forever

We came together just to change the weather
Busy Bee, he made this game remember?
These unoriginal rap flows, I don't speak those
Too many rappers just copy like Kinko's

Dressin' like they from office depot
Tryin' to be CEO's with whack weak flows
I teach those that flow how to be better
I train MC's to gain in any endeavor

But if you tryin' to diss, you'll get dismissed from the class
In other words, I'm kickin' yo' ass

Why they can't ever solve the crime Marley?

I don't know

You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper

Scott LaRock's a open case, unresolved
The cops never find the killer, when it's one of ours
Tupac's a open case, even though
He was killed in a open place, there's really no haste

It's sorta like we govern ourselves
Even though we lack a love for ourselves
Or is that we know this thug shit sells?
You want them pockets to swell well

Even though we know we livin' in hell, what about big L?
Hold up, let's stop frontin', let me tell you somethin'
JMJ's dead and the cops don't know nuthin'?
We gotta open our eyes to this too, this issue

The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper

He simply becomes a poster, somethin' to run after
A reason for these kids to pull they guns faster
Tryin' to emulate and be like dead rappers

I roll with them visionary look-ahead rappers
From the city to the farm pushin' John Deere tractors
Bust this, in the city, there is no justice
The whole system is flawed, how could you trust this?

Crimes can't seem to be solved when it's one of us
That's why there's no forgiveness and cats just wanna bust

Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't say, ""Di-di-di-dah-di-di-di-day""

Then we'll have to look for you and chop you all up

Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new, what?

Everythin' you doin' kid we already did it
Everythin' you spittin' kid we already spit it
This my 15th album, I'm havin' fun wit'chu critics
Everythin' you doin kid we already did it

If rap was a toilet, I woulda already shit it
Critics sayin', ""Kris you shoulda already quit it""
But I can't stop, won't stop spittin' crazy lyrics
'Cause I, am hip hop, other rappers just try

You critics wanna sit down and debate every line
But tryin' to get into my concert same time
Spot all packed up, cops yellin', ""Back up, back up""
KRS yellin', ""Sound man turn the track up""

We act up the whole spot a hour straight
We rock 30 classics at least 20 breaks
We always in demand and you must over stand man
We won't be found man on Billboard or SoundScan

Seek me and you will find
Where I be kickin' or spittin' that ill rhyme
Until then they can't see me 'cause I be

Which one of you punk ass rappers
Wanna get chewed up like seafood platters?
Bring your best rhyme, it don't matter to me
You ain't gettin' on tonight by battlin' me

The streets won't forgive you man, them guns go blam
Have you crawlin' up the wall like Spider-Man
You all in the jungle, with no Spears like Brittney
Like the coke want Whitney, you still wanna get me

But no, you ain't made for this
I put my hand through your chest like Agent Smith
I jam like them big four-fifths
I go off like a glock 9, no safety on Kris

y'all talk 'bout platinum, I don't need all that
I got 26 gold and platinum plaques
I'll take away your rights like the Patriot Act
Have your whole crew thinkin', ""Well maybe he is kinda whack""

Marley Marl,"[Incomprehensible] to you super listeners how you doing tonight?
All you fly guys and fly girls
Welcome once again to the world famous
Mister Magic Rap Attack and of course I am [Incomprehensible]

Way way back before the 'Hots' and the 'Powers'
We used to listen to live mixin' for hours
Roxanne Shanté, U.T.F.O.
Mister Magic Rap Attack some of y'all know

But I was in the shelter in weakness
Homeless, turntableless and microphoneless
Fresh gearless but still I was fearless
And focused on being the dopest MC alive

It's '85, LL's on Def Jam with the best jam
And Whodini's on Jive, man you know I had to survive
New York City was crazy in the 80's but damn it was live

So here comes the Juice Crew with MC Shan
Shanté's already the queen, Marley's already the man
Y'all don't really understand
When you throw on Shanté or Shan it got live in the jam

So we went to Mister Magic
If anybody had to power to put you on he had it
We gave up the demo tape no love lost
But it seems Mister Magic just brushed us off

Somehow we heard we were whack
Every track, and that we shouldn't even call back
Right there my jaw dropped, no doubt
But it made me see what I was all about

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

In the spot new hip hop and Latin Quarters
And the Union Square and the rooftop
We used to hear them tunes pop in the parking lot
Where it got dark a lot me and Scott La Rock

But it was all for the hip hoppers
Salt-N-Pepa answered Doug E Fresh with 'The Show Stoppa'
MC Shan was gonna challenge LL
Shanté was battling 3 or 4 groups at the same time what the hell

Answer records were big then after Shanté did it
Everybody was trying to spit them so we spit off
To tell you the truth it was the only way an MC could get on

We answered MC Shan's 'Queensbridge'
A dope jam about where he was from and where he lived
But in the Bronx there was these kids
KRS, Scott La Rock trying to live

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

This it what an MC was we had a strong street buzz
Marley and Shan showed us some love and love never hurt
'Cause while Shan was with Marley we was with DJ Red Alert

Every Friday night, every Saturday night
On the airwaves the battle was right
Under New York nights, smog and lights
Jargon at night the Roxy used to get so hype

You could put on your headset
And get what heads didn't get yet
Live MCs going, ""Check, check""
Spitin' rhymes over the radio set

These are the days and the ways I can never forget
So I don't forget it to Marley and Shan I am indebted
For the start of my career these guys could take credit

For my rappin', the whole battle they let it all happen
Marley and Shan and Shanté could have been gun strapping cousin
But they wasn't and you know why
'Cause we was on some real hip hop let's keep it buzzing

We started off street, now you pop, what's happenin??
You callin? me contradictory
Yet I'm the most consistent MC in rap's history

Is that the mic? Give it to me, hip hop, it's livin? in me
I smack rappers in they mouth deliberately

I'm the difference between real and Music TV

We ain't done, uh huh
We ain't done, let's go
Here we go, here we go
Y'all been waitin? for this
Here we go

I spit them conscious lyrics for those that can hear it
I'd rather rhyme about the mind and the body and spirit
But them cats be too hardheaded, they like, ?Aww, forget it?
'Til they locked up and they blood is sheddin?

I really spit conscious rap
And when I say stop the violence
How you think we stoppin? that?
With a flower, a protest, a rally, a band
Oh no, I got the baseball bat in my hand

Overstand, I'm takin? a stand, not takin? ?The? stand
I don't disrespect women ?cause I'm a man
And some say fe-man
You uninformed journalists, y'all can talk to the hand

On my block, women get respect and trust
?Cause when you diss a woman you dissin? her fetus
And dissin? our unborn children will defeat us
I'm not an elitist, I just know the world need us

I know the truth, it liveth
What though the darkness 'round me close
Songs in the night it giveth

While to that rock I'm clinging
Since love is Lord of Heaven and Earth

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear
And hear their death knells ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near

When friends by shame are undefiled

Who have gone this way before.
I am determined to go and see them, Good Lord,

Marlin Sisters,"I wondered alone one night. 
Till I heard an orchestra play.
I met you when lights were bright,
and people were carefree and gay.
You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
and softly you strolled away.
 
I dream of that night with you,
lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
and blue were the skies.
Just like the blue skirt you wore.
Come back blue lady come back.

""A doll,"" said William, ""is what I need
To wash and clean, and dress and feed

""A Doll to give a bottle to
And put to bed when day is through
And any time my doll gets ill
I'll take good care of it,"" said my friend Bill

A doll, a doll, William wants a doll
Don't be a sissy said his best friend Ed
Why should a boy want to play with a doll
Dolls are for girls said his cousin Fred
Don't be a jerk, said his older brother
""I know what to do,"" said his father to his mother

So his father bought him a basketball
A badminton set, and that's not all
A bag of marbles, a baseball glove
And all the things a boy would love

And Bill was good at every game
Enjoyed them all, but all the same
When Billy's father praised his skill
""Can I please have a doll now,"" said my friend Bill

A doll, a doll, William wants a doll
A doll, a doll, William wants a doll

Then William's grandma arrived one day
And wanted to know what he liked to play
And Bill said, ""Baseball's my favorite game
I like to play, but all the same

""I'd give my bat and ball and glove
To have a doll that I could love""
""How very wise,"" his grandma said
Said Bill, ""but everyone says this instead""

A doll, a doll, William wants a doll
A doll, a doll, William wants a doll

So William's grandma, as I've been told
Bought William a doll, to hug and hold
And William's father began to frown
But grandma smiled, and calmed him down

Explaining, William wants a doll
So when he has a baby someday
He'll know how to dress it, put diapers on double
And gently caress it to bring up a bubble
And care for his baby as every good father
Should learn to do

William has a doll, William has a doll
'Cause someday he is gonna be a father, too",William's Doll,1972

Que desato un incendio
Buscamos una excusa para

Hablar y conocernos
Pero no basta, pero no basta
Yo quiero más

Me diste tu teléfono
Y tu nombre completo
Me hablaste con los ojos

Y yo pude darte un beso
Pero no basta, pero no basta
Yo quiero más

Me muero por pasar contigo
Un momento que no puedas olvidar

Una cena con champaña y velas
Celebrando bajo las estrellas
Pero no basta, pero no basta
Que te sientas deseada y bella

Que te pueda conocer más cerca
Pero no basta, pero no basta
Noche y día quiero verte
Para dedicarte, toda mi atención

Me diste algunas horas
Que resultaron cortas
Te acompañe a tu puerta

Y allí te besé en la boca
Pero no basta, pero no basta

Sólo tuve el tiempo necesario
Para encontrar el camino

that you are my only lover, and it's wonderful

As you held me hypnotized

Smiles awaken as we share 
Our golden slumbers long gone 
Only you and I were there 

And now I'll never be the same

Marlon Jordan,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1991
Marlon Jordan,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2005

This is the love I gave,
This is the life we made,

And after the morning breaks,
The sound the morning makes,
Is carrying our mistakes,
And the loss we have to bear.

This is the truth I found.
There's no one to keep me down

There's just a vacancy

There's only you and me

I try to move on
Whatever it was

But every time I'll sing for you

Wait, the same little boy with the cassette tape?
The big foot jeans, awaiting at the school gate
Late night thoughts, he's tearing up the paper
And here's the soundbite ten years later
He took the yard to the city an he mixed it
Mattafixed it, now he's on some sick shhh
So keep your money and your cars and your deals

Wait the same little boy they used to underestimate?
Made a great escape with only practice
An attic and a mattress
This same man is trying to hatch this game plan
And catch a vibe make it world wide
Spirals of idols and rivals labelled as a dreamer
Stroll as the world rolls by you in a beamer
Now empathize if you know how it feels
Riding home on the same two wheels
I made my best friends
From the West Indies to the West End
In every corner in every section
Perfection, long lasting connection
The little boy with the clear skin complexion
Afternoons and I'm scrubbing old sneakers
In time to the vibes from my makeshift speakers
An assortment laments from my Walkman
I'm still trying to walk good though
I'm slightly awkward

No matter how you brand it I'm still the same bandit

Só pra me agradar

Quando a gente vai dormir e ainda é quando acordar

E cada jeito dela é uma emoção
Toda mulher causa um efeito que esconde
Que seu corpo perfeito
É só um convite pro que ela tem no coração

When you taught me how to say

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Marmalade,"Oh, the geese fly and the peewit sing
As I ride on my horse, on the first day of spring
And the river flows o'er the grass so green
As I fly to my Lady of Catrine

And in my mind, the church bell rings
Could it be just for me on the first day of spring?
Some wedding scene, upon a village green
Wish it were me and my Lady of Catrine

Well, the wind is fresh and my eyes are bright
As I see my Lady's castle come into sight
And I'll bow to her, like a King to Queen
Then I'll kiss my sweet Lady of Catrine

Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun.""

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

Take my breath away

The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me

Find a way to bring myself back home to you

So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical

Where you are seems to be

As far as an eternity

Outstretched arms open hearts

And if it never ends then when do we start?

I'll never leave you behind

Or treat you unkind

I know you understand

And with a tear in my eye

Give me the sweetest goodbye

That I ever did receive


Pushing forward and arching back

Bring me closer to heart attack

Say goodbye and just fly away

When you comeback

I have some things to say


How does it feel to know you never have to be alone

When you get home

There must be someplace here that only you and I could go

So I can show you how I

Dream away everyday

Try so hard to disregard

The rhythm of the rain that drops

And coincides with the beating of my heart


I'll never leave you behind

Or treat you unkind

I know you understand

And with a tear in my eye

Give me the sweetest goodbye

That I ever did receive


Pushing forward and arching back

Bring me closer to heart attack

Say goodbye and just fly away

When you comeback

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone

When you get home

There must be someplace here that only you and I could go

So I can show you how I feel

Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

I'm lost; I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)

Take me back, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me

I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh

Keep them locked up somewhere safe

Demonstrations, airing your views 
Doctor Spock, Captain Kirk 
Generation that loved to flirt 
Getting down to the funky sound of the one and only James Brown 
Mods and Rockers having fight
Zooming around on your Vespa bike 
Out of touch out of reach
Out of their heads on Brighton Beach
Flower Power, paint your face Baby boom for the human race
Mini skirts and magazines
Goodbye Miss Norma Jean 
Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet, Doris Day

Talking to someone you meet
Talk about the Go Go beat

The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks

A top cat that rocks rap

You figure you have to sneak up cause I'm bigger
Yo jigga, take down the beat just a little
Far from brittle, chew a nigga like a skittle
But it'll, be a cold day in the Caribean
At the Meridian, I swim through girls like an amphibian
I'm witty and, versed with the lyrical blessin
Never fessin, and keep the chickens second-guessin

I'm not the type to act a fool, catching brothers with a tool
I just bag up skins, I play it cool
I kick game, I have your mind is
Cause I can be bummy and nappy headed, and still pull a Dom P
(Pimping is hard) Not to me
You got a lot to see, the way I put skins under lock and key
And let them front the role like they outstanding
Huh, I leavem 'em out standing in the cold
A girl act up, then I cut her off
(Is your game smooth?) Is it? My shit's butter soft
So won't y'all just hear me in
(Why's that?) I get girls open like a cesarian
Yo, I roll with the big men and I don't have to trickin'
And mess around just to get skins
So all y'all niggas that's geese, I can make that shit cease
When I slide up in the peace

	One time for your mind, here we go
	You know my style, now peep the flow
	Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
	Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 4x)",Gameplan,1996

What it feels like
Sex with you
It's like
Heh, it's like
Damn
I don't really know what it's like
But uh, let me try to explain

Sex with you is like when I wake up in the morning
Smell that good old breakfast mama use to make
Sex with you is like the feeling that you get
When all your friends surprise you on your birthday
Sex with you is like, like I made the last shot and everybody screaming my name
Sex with you is like my pocket full of dough and I don't worry 'bout a damn thing

When I think about the sex
Nothing better comes to mind
I want to sex you all the damn time
Thinking 'bout the sex
It's got me one, beauty come true
And the sex fight we always do
Sex with you is really the best with you
It makes life worth going through
And nobody got a body like you
'Cause my sex with you is one easy, got to go lookin' in the street, it's you
Ain't nothing better then the way we do
Girl I love having sex with you

Sex with you is like winning in a war after working so damn hard
Sex with you is like when the man at the dealership hands over the keys to my new car
Sex with you is like when I check's up in the mail after been broke for so long
Sex with you is like, like getting off the bench and shorty is there to take you home

It's all about the freaky things we do
And I know, you like it just as much as I do
Baby I ain't never try to hit and run
I'm just trying to make you the only one
I'll sex you up on the regular
'Cause ain't nothing better then sex with you, uh

Let me break it down and tell you what your sex is like
Sex with you is like going to the strip club
And ain't gotta pay for none of that strip love
Sex with you is like, like a closet full of air force
Sex with you is like, like be the first nigga in the hood with backdrop's 45's

Sex with you is really the best with you
It makes life worth going through
And nobody got a body like you
'Cause my sex with you is one easy, got to go lookin' in the street it's you
Ain't nothing better then the way we do

I made the wrong decisions
That I shouldn't have made
She played me, betrayed me
Can't believe I fell for this girl

But you lied to me, babe
Now I realize that you ain't worth my time
You ain't worth it baby

And I was doin' wrong but I want to do right girl
(All because of you) stayin' out all night
Want to make it right, want to change my life girl
(All because of you) I don't want to play no games
Want to change your name to my name baby
(All because of you) not goin' be the man that I used to be, no
I changed because of you

Can't take back the things that I did before
But baby I'm promising that my heart is yours(yours)
Know it ain't easy baby, but you gotta believe me baby
All I'm askin' for is one more chance, I changed because of you

It used to be that you in the club poppin' bottles, wrists glistenin'
Shorty tried to tell me 'chill', but I wasn't listenin'
I can't deny, you knew me from bein' immature
Homeboy was sayin' 'sorry', take you to the country store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom, you was there to pick me up
I neglected you but then we'd hug and we'd kiss it up
But you never do nuttin' up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace
But now I see I'll neva find another like you
You the type boo, make a playa want to wife you
But me and you, this money's not a issue
When I miss you, when I touch you, I can feel it in my bones
I'm still wit you and I'm sorry 'bout the way I did you

(All because of you) ooh, you're the love of my life
And I was doin' (ooh) wrong but I want to do right girl
(All because of you) stayin' out all night (no more stayin' out at night, ooh)

You go home when you want to
Come when you want to
MH give em something they can crunk to
Intimidation never reached to my breadskin
Especially when them ben franks rapped in rubberbands
In the club I'm in the corner boy
Why you haters still broke on the corner boy
I can run rap when I'm on the track with Corey boy
Back on snap behind the base more the noise
When I 2-step you can't even join the boy
the moon goin up your girl makin all the noise
when the moon go down she still on the boy
Mona Lisa Mona Lisa on the boy

I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready

When you talked about our future
You would nod your head and smile
But I didn't understand it, I was living in denial
I couldn't see the picture, didn't wanna see it clearer
'Cause I was so young
And now that I can't get ya, wanted to be wit' ya
What have I become?

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

Mamma told me 'bout excuses
She'd say, ""They're no use to say""
What you would have done but didn't
I had to learn the hard way
Now that it's over, I wanted to just hold you
But I know I can't
I'm tryna be a soldier, I wanna do it over
Give me one more chance, I wasn't ready

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

Can I get a redo, baby?
'Cause you know I need you, baby
And now I'm ready for your love, your love

I just wanna see you, baby
Just wanna smell and breathe you, baby
'Cause I hate what we've become
I wasn't ready for love

I waited, I contemplated and then I did it
It was room for relationship, but pretty had to hit it
We like hand and glove, head to a yankee fitted
Game is obsolete, it's all how you spit it
Better yet listen 'cause karma's a true avenger
Sort of like a Ninja or a king in all his splendor
Remember, love can be as cold as December
Unless it's in its truest form, I could never injure

Your heart, break you or make you see my vision
'Cause I know eventually you'll see my vision
By the way I'm livin' and it's a given
I'm giving you my heart, I'm giving you my soul
I'm giving you my gold

I'm sorry for the dirt that I did
Sneaking broads in and out the crib
The double life that I lived
They say a fool sells dreams
But a man makes dreams come true
Mami, I changed all for the love of you
I wasn't ready back then though

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then
But the truth is I wasn't ready

If this is a game then I've been playing 'cause
I never gave you my all when I had your trust
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance and we can make up
I wish it could have worked back then

T.U.G.
Let's get 'em

Beautiful, she seemed
But looks ain't everything to me
She took my heart from me
And every single part of me

She had me sprung
I didn't know what to do
'Cause I was blinded from the truth
I'm saying that girl was something else

I got caught up
My feelings I couldn't control
I trusted everything I had with her
That girl was something else

I made the wrong decisions
That I shouldn't have made
She played me, betrayed me
Can't believe I fell for this girl

You was supposed to be my girlfriend, baby
But you lied to me, babe
Now I realize that you ain't worth my time
You ain't worth it baby
(So now I gotta let you go)

She had me sprung
I didn't know what to do
'Cause I was blinded from the truth
I'm saying that girl was something else

I got caught up
My feelings I couldn't control
I trusted everything I had with her
That girl was something else

You was supposed to be my girlfriend
But you lied to me babe
Now I realize that you ain't worth my time
You ain't worth it baby

She had me sprung
I didn't know what to do

I blew yours, you blew mines
Sometimes I'll drop you a line

Just keep it on the low

Girl, I'm not playin' games
I've been with other dames
I figure 'what's the use?'
There's really no excuse
Many good qualities
I can't think of one complaint
That's why you're number one
And all the others ain't love

You're everything a man like me could ever want
Give me what I need and nothing that I don't

Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I don't wanna play no more
If I let go, you let go
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
But I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

Verse 1(Marques Houston)

Hey girl come here sit down
Lemme holla at you a while
Gotta get this off my chest 
Hope that you can handle it
We've been seeing each other a lot
Honestly I don't want it to stop
You and me; Me and you
I'm liking what we've got
Only thing that's bothering me 
We ain't as close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back your love for me
How do you expect to grow if you just don't let go

Chorus(Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 2(Mya)

don't take offense to this
Not tryna start no mess
Ain't tryna have you stressed
This is just a little test
I wanna see how serious
Serious you are of us
Do you like or like me not
I'm loving what we've got
Only thing that bothers me 
We ain't close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do expect this thing to grow
If you don't let it go go go go

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 3(Shawnna)
Everytime I get to thinking bout you
I see I can't be without you
Cause you that shit, that's it
And I really can't leave right now boo
You my fix, your kiss
Made me bout to let go bout to
But wait right quick can't slip
I don't really think your down with this
See I played these games before
And I fall everytime we go
Cause see I can't no more
I move slow but don't really wanna stop the flow
Don't know what to do
Gotta just relax and hold back
Just sit back and roll that, roll that, rolle that

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back

Even though you ain't innocent at all
And now I feel so stupid cause I'm the only man
That ever loved you even with all your flaws
Even your best friend questioned why
I still would be with you after knowing your past
But what she didn't understand is knowing your past is why I thought we could last

We had something special but
What? Was I not good enough for you

Can't show mine was fine

Maybe one day we'll go back to being just friends

Y de muerte la hirió

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

Marracash,"Questo film
Parla di un tipo, Charlie Brigante detto Carlito
Portoricano, esce dal gabbio per un cavillo
Oh fra ne ha fatti cinque invece che trenta (e come?)
Boh ma il suo avvocato fotte il sistema (ok)
Frà dopo 5 anni dentro l'aria è diversa
Ride e scherza ma non trova una faccia che sia la stessa
Era il capo, ma la galera ormai l'ha cambiato (chiaro)
Ed in testa pensa ""ho chiuso con tutto quanto"" (sì, insomma?)
Pensa a mettere insieme una somma (che somma?)
Non so frà, vuole togliersi dalla fogna
Sogna un noleggio auto frà, polleggio e calmo (bah)
Le palle al caldo, le palme e l'oceano affianco
Rivede la vecchia donna è sola e lo ama ancora (see)
Vabbe zio è un film! Non stopparmi ogni parola
La storia è che Carlito è uscito dal gabbio
Ma l'ha capita e cambia vita frà è chiaro il messaggio?

Questa vita ti si appiccica addosso
E se vai su poi giù quasi sempre di botto
È la via di Carlito (la via di Carlito)
È la via di Carlito (la la via di Carlito)
Cerchi la redenzione, cerchi di uscirne fuori
Cerchi la retta via ma sappi che tu percorri
La via di Carlito (la via di Carlito)
È la via di Carlito (la la via di Carlito)

(C'è riuscito sto Carlito?) Aspetta che mo' c'arrivo
Per fare il cash si mette in business con il suo amico
(Droga?) No, prende la quota di un bel locale
(E come fa?) Vecchi amici e la gabbia senza parlare (ah)
Frà manca poco, qualche mese di sgobbo
Qualche mese d'Inferno per mettere tutto a posto
Qualche lavoro sporco, qualche morto di troppo
Qualche stronzo che è nuovo e non riconosce il suo volto
(Poi?) Poi l'avvocato fa una minchiata, una gran minchiata
Si mette a fare il gangster, fotte i soldi alla mafia
Non puoi imparare sto mestiere da grande (già lo sai)
È nei guai e tira in mezzo Brigante, lui
Deve accettare (chiaro, l'ha fatto scarcerare)
Bravo, è l'onore, il codice o sei un infame
Il cappio della vita gli stringe il collo
Vita che hai intrapreso (o quella che ti han cucito addosso)

Questa vita ti si appiccica addosso
E se vai su poi giù quasi sempre di botto
È la via di Carlito (la via di Carlito)

Cerchi la redenzione, cerchi di uscirne fuori
Cerchi la retta via ma sappi che tu percorri
La via di Carlito (la via di Carlito)
È la via di Carlito (la la via di Carlito)

E con la mafia che lo cerca, l'avvocato poi crepa
(L'hanno trovato?) Certo, Sicilia uguale vendetta certa
Ormai è braccato ed ha un giorno per togliersi dal cazzo
Chiama la donna organizza per quella sera stessa
Alla stazione le ultime sparatorie, secca i siciliani
Corre al treno l'annunciatore dice
""Ultima chiamata"" lui pensa che ce l'ha fatta
Ormai è li, lei è bellissima come non è mai stata
E chi c'è ad aspettarlo? Chi non è mai in ritardo? (La morte)
Esatto, sì, dal Bronx c'è Benny Blanco
E bang bang è andato, bang bang è ucciso
Da un nuovo giovane e affamato Carlito

Milano pesta, sgomito nella ressa
Coi soldi in testa
Levarsi da qui, una vita diversa

Ora si è fatto il Subaru, in giro spende come un Sultano

Ma con gli affari era il più bravo
Anche suo padre dalle campagne del sud schiavo
Nel substrato anche suo padre ha sempre sudato
E ora che è sciupato non si regge sulle sue gambe
Fra cosa ti ha lasciato? una tv più grande
Potrei fare come Pietro andarmene lontano
Dove il mondo è più indietro e un po' meno bastardo
Ed abbandonare la gara ed abbondare le canne
Lasciare che sia lo spirito ad appagarmi
Fra anche lui stava in via dei poeti saccente
Ed ha scelto una giungla vera al posto di una di cemento
Potrei come Enzo fottermi del resto

Potrei entrare e uscire di galera
Senza capirla mai ad ogni nuova pera
Come Mauri e Seba
Anche loro insieme dalla scuola media
Fumavo con loro le canne la sera sulla Lancia Tema
Potrei spingermi in vena la stessa di Antonio, la stessa merda
Surrogato della pace in terra
Ed allentare il guinzaglio da questa sofferenza
Ed aspettare che il taglio zittisca la coscienza
Potrei chiudere con le donne, farmi solo le troie
L'amore spezza gli uomini e non solo il cuore
Potrei far l'avvocato come Teo con la testa che ho
E gli stronzi che ho visto in ateneo
Potrei scordarmi chi ero come Luca, come Giusy

Marracash,"Mai stato in prigione, sono le stesse le sensazioni
Camera mia con pareti più spesse e sai da soli
Camminano in pochi, cattivi modi
Come stampelle, come bretelle per i pantaloni
E fugge e corre, il mondo gira e corre sul posto
Se perdi muori ma ben prima di essere morto
Vigliaccheria: piega i più duri che conosco
Non è la via, sono i tamburi dello scontro
E ogni tanto per capirlo serve uno schiaffo
Come in amore: lo capisci quando ti lascio
Nessun rimpianto, i rancori restano anche quando dormi
Come le unghie che crescono dopo che muori
E i creditori in conto aperto non accettano buone intenzioni
Non ti rispettano se ti vergogni
E non c'è questo nei libri che ho letto
La fuori la vita non impartisce ma infligge lezioni

La mia prigione è nella mente
Sei tra la gente in isolamento
È solamente un brutto momento
Ridere e piangere di cuore, essere un bravo attore
Volare oltre la coltre di chi è mediocre

Anime perse

A volte è solo un dare un nome a cose che già hai dentro
E tra le tempie è il mio tempio, è la mia prigione
Su questo tempo dare l'esempio è la mia cauzione
E se è nella mente la tua prigione
Pensa attentamente: la libertà è una decisione
Non sempre scrivo consapevole, lo so
Però non sempre vivo consapevole
Non ho ragione?!
E proporzione non c'è tra quanto è grosso e quanto vale
Tra la ferita e quanto fa male
Chi è ""normale"" è il dubbio, no male
Chiuso in una vita non male, non vale

Lava e stira sognando Manila

Con cash o senza eran belle vacanze
Esco di testa qua tra quattro stanze

Moda italiana e tecnologia giapponese
Viaggi in Tunisia e bella vita

Ce l'ho impresso, non l'avevo mai visto depresso
Stavamo in centro, casa di ringhiera, piena di immigrati
Senza i sanitari, uscivo per andare al cesso
Per un po' restò disoccupato
Stava al bar sotto casa coi Campari a tenersi occupato
Faceva briscole coi paesani
Con gli occhi rossi per il fumo e gli amari
Io ero alle elementari
Ed ero in classe coi bimbi fortunati
Coi dindi nei salvadanai e i genitori educati
E io, fra', stavo coi figli d'immigrati, coi figli di operai
Mi vergognavo, i miei erano ignoranti
Mi vergognavo del dialetto
E mi prendevo con gli altri al parchetto
Se le prendevo, lui mi dava il resto
A darmele era sempre mia madre
Io fingevo, ma in realtà, a quell'età, ormai già non mi faceva male

E su mia madre ebbe un brutto impatto
Era venuta a Milano sognando una casa privata
E ora stava alla Barona, dietro una risaia
E io diventai grande in un lampo
Perché alle medie volavano sedie
E le bestemmie coi pugni sul banco
E ognuno si prendeva ciò che non aveva
L'aria tesa per due sguardi
Il pretesto, la scusa: ""c'hai moneta?""
No, e poi facevi a pugni
Scappare è da conigli
Le sigarette, biciclette, motorini
Poi la sera coi più grandi ascoltavamo le imprese dei miti
E imparavamo ad odiare gli sbirri
E nel quartiere non hai niente, ma hai i veri amici
Non possedere ti rallenta, ma puoi riuscirci

Che cosa resta a noi?

Fra e' il mio regalo ai nullatenenti
Io il mullah tra i reietti
A chi non ha il pane e chi ha perso i denti
E sta nelle popolari in celle di alveari
Con i suoi e le sorelle in quaranta metri quadri
Ha belve strette nei penitenziari
Quelli magari che vanno in manette sbarbi per sbagli adolescenziali
Vanno al fresco ed escono criminali
Questo è per i vari torti subiti da porci istituzionali
A chi esce tardi la sera senza i vestiti cari
Quelli che li vedi al club solo se c’è open bar al party
Ad ogni sbronzo in città perso
che ogni giorno a zonzo guarda i frà di traverso
A chi l’ha presa credito e mo sta inguaiato
Rischi i tagli
Speri di raccontargli che non c’eri tagliato
A chi c’è nato senza fiato senza fato Dio l’ha fatto
e alla sua mensa senza piatto
A chi ha la lama occultabile dentro ai boxer
Vuole la grana facile da uno coi dockers
Ma non puoi dare colpi bassi alla sorte
Frà la sorte è una bugia ed ha le gambe corte
Ed il principe non cerca mai moglie nelle fogne
Le nostre donne danno figli con le voglie
A chi coglie che io ho la stoffa per raccontare

A chi si sveglia la mattina presto
Si rassegna ad un onesto lavoro otto ore lo stesso gesto
A chi a quell’ora stende l’ultima riga molesto
in parlantina e tace solo a se stesso
A chi spesso tiri in mezzo di riflesso
Se rimi ti fingi grezzo, io dis-rispetto
Credulone col mito d’uomo tutto d'un pezzo
Ti basta l’acetone e tieni un sasso compresso, fesso
A chi ha la madre che sta in ansia e insonne in un letto
A chi è vestito ansa , dorme in sala d’aspetto
Chi ha il padre che parla solo dialetto
Cambiano i tempi e modi
e il mondo coniuga con l’imperfetto
A chi sogna la ribalta e i riflettori
All’alba la ribalta è quella di un camion per i traslochi
Per i vostri vuoti riempiti dai nostri volti
Sinistra destra resta una trappola per topi
E a mio nonno che è in Sicilia ancora spreme la vite nell’orto
Ed a mio padre hanno spremuto la vita dal corpo
Ed al mio sporco sporco su-sudicio
A chi ha su-subito e vuole tutto e su-subito

Dal sogno di una bella donna che mi mantenga
Le sette e mezza, sono già in ritardo
Mi vesto al volo, colazione con Marlboro
Milano è grigia, mi sembra un freezer
In motorino, senza Uno diesel
Al magazzino dove lavoro
Per otto ore, a volte nove
Timbro il cartellino, poi mi reco al nastro
Tiro su ogni pacco incellophanato
Dopo lo accatasto sopra ad un bancale
La fattura a lato e ne aspetto un altro
Ogni tanto pauso, due minchiate
Caffè scrauso, si riparte
Alle sei stacco, si torna a casa
E poi mangio stanco e vado dritto a nanna
E sogno il cash

Zio, è dura far piovere, piovere cash
Com'è dura far piovere cash
Zio, è dura far piovere, piovere cash
Com'è dura far piovere cash

A mezzogiorno il sole filtra
Scaldo una pizza, stappo una birra
Mi suona il cella e già sbattella
Il tipo è qua sotto ed è sotto con la barella
Bella, bella, eh eh
Prendo su il cash e poi dico bella
Bella, bella, eh eh
Do un colpo di pedivella
E metto in moto, vado dal tipo
Gli porto quanto abbiamo pattuito
E passo in piazza e blocco Vito
E mi prendo quel che abbiamo pattuito
Ma, fra', è la sera che faccio il delirio
Che lavoro bene e che riprendo il giro
Ma c'è sempre un guaio, sto nello schifo

E caccio via la groupie, butto il cash sul letto
Così prende il taxi, faccio i bagagli
Che tra venti minuti c'ho un altro concerto
Lì becco l'applauso, scendo dal palco
Nel backstage abbraccio tutto quanto il branco
Sono le mandrie ed io il Rio Grande
Si dissetano come su Discovery Channel
Per farli stare bene occupo il privé
Ordino Moët, sordido strip club
E per fare stare bene me prendo una miss
Lascio lì il team, pago la suite
Ma poi nel buio mi imparanoio
Non ho più sonno, no non ho più un soldo
E il CD non vende come ci si attende
La danza della pioggia mi ritorna in mente

Quante trappole ho visto
Fra troppe in questo percorso
Quanti eran finti amici e stavano per riuscirci
Sai alcuni sono dei finti amici professionisti
E ti fanno la bella faccia
Dopo una bella traccia
E sanno aspettare anni
Si sanno restare a galla
Chi striscia fra non inciampa
Chi sopra una panca campa
E chi sopra una panca crepa cliente di ciò che spaccia
Più devi frequentarli
Più devi omologarti
E fai qll ke fanno gli altri
Finchè diventi gli altri
Seguito dai tuoi miraggi se in major non vendi
Fai un giro solo sull'ottovolante e poi scendi
Zio ho imparato che zero business finchè
Più balordo di te come recuperi il cash
Quanti erano più grossi mentre io ero un fruscello
E da sempre che per impormi ho dovuto usare il cervello

Trova le trappole trappole trappole si sn trappole trappole trappole

Trappole in uno sguardo in una stretta di mano
Ne ho fatte scattare tante ora le vedo da lontano
Trappole tra due coscie
In trappola come mosche
Aggrappato alle roccie
In un oceano di angoscie
In trappola in un lavoro so che ti senti appassire
Intrappolato in un luogo quando vorresti partire
In trappola dell'infidia con l'ansia dell'abortura
Non credi che esista l'anima infatti tu non ne hai una
E la paura è la peggiore trappola
Si mangia tanti inebititi ai semafori zio coi visi affranti
A stare con una sola diventa una religione
L'affetto si fa prigione l'effetto fra è che ti rode
La tattica la sottigliezza la durevolezza
L'intuito e l'istinto di sopravvivenza
Non lascio che l'ambizione mi intrappoli le parole
La gabbia e la seduzione piacere a tante persone

L'MC innovativo, le perle che scrivo, non perdere il filo
Il vuoto nell'Io, il vuoto nel frigo, la verve anti-divo
L'auto-ironia e il sorriso, non sono mai solo rime
Io, zio, mi esprimo, i libri che leggo, i finti che osservo
Un futuro incerto, un passato da servo
Una voce diversa che ha un nuovo gergo, la pura poesia
Uscire di senno, i brandelli dell'anima mia
Stesi ad asciugare all'inferno, eucarestia
Educazione cristiana e così sia
Intelli-gangsta, qualcosa che scatta ed è quasi magia
Ciò che provo non ha nome ed invento i vocaboli
Con l'immaginazione mi inventavo i giocattoli
Tutti i miei sbatti, pochi ne escono intatti
Questi anfratti nella mia testa, carrozze trainate da ratti
(Io) il re delle fogne, i saggi alle gogne
I soldi che non ho, l'arte dell'arrangiò e quella di trovarsi rogne
La vita che sfreccia, la coca fa breccia, la feccia che vedo
La via di Carlito non riesco a lasciarmela indietro
Essere vero, essere umano
Essere un vero essere umano e, che cazzo, non sempre sincero 
Soldi, potere e rispetto
Fai l'inverso ed aggiungici senza affetto
È il teorema del reietto
Il vero talento, l'MC più copiato al momento
Il genio del ghetto in ascesa
Col rispetto di tutta la scena

Traffici di sostanze e di files, sbirri telematici
I.A.C.P. ora si chiamano A.L.E.R

Le piazze quando esistevano, i pazzi si sistemano

Il sangue che condivido, fra', rappo con un motivo

Tu tremi già e sai che qualcosa non va
Non pensarci perché tanto questa volta io
Non so dirtelo

La città è ormai lontana e sono qui che guido
Sono vivo, e ho ancora lei vicino
Accucciata sul sedile, almeno lei è innocente
Lei che non sa niente di quello che combino
Io meschino, che ho rovinato tutto
Come ho potuto? Chissà, forse era destino
E butto giù un sorso dal suo finestrino
Per tenere chiuso fuori il buio, arriverà il mattino
E non farmi domande e io non ti dirò bugie
Ma tu non me lo chiedi perché sto sulle mie
Perché ti ho chiesto di partire, senza dirlo a nessuno
Perché penso per due, che ho sempre pensato per uno
""E non c'è più il futuro di una volta""
Leggo al cesso dell'autogrill, che ironia della sorte
Ma non c'è ironia nella morte
Pago il caffè ed esco, c'è foschia questa notte

E lei mi fa ciao dal parabrezza, ingoio l'amarezza
Voglio che mi veda senza
C'è il mare, c'è brezza, le corro incontro
Coi biglietti in tasca per la prima nave in partenza
E tutto la diverte, ride, la sto a guardare
Semplicemente pensando che le è andata male
Messina splende, guido tra i fichi d'india
Arance di Sicilia, lei si sistema il trucco alle ciglia
Arriviamo che sono già a tavola, Rino è a capotavola
È sorpreso ma non chiede che ci faccio là
Ci sistema fuori Avola
Vecchia casa isolata, tutta in pietra, e, puff, sembra una favola
Se ne innamora e io penso che sia un bel modo
Per un uomo di passare la sua ultima settimana
Stiamo solo per qualche ora, io bevo, sciolgo quel nodo
Ora quella tenda chiudila, che mi va

Fissami pure, non so dirti la verità
Dai vieni qua e dimmi che anch'io ho un'anima

Passati i primi giorni non penso nemmeno più a scappare
Non le dico mai no, qualsiasi cosa voglia fare
Il mare, le cene, la pace, le chiese, le strade di giorno
Lei così viva e bella, io dentro morto
Più mi accorgevo di quanto era bella averla
Più si avvicinava il momento di perderla
E lei era sempre stata lì, come una fune tesa
E io non mi ero mai allungato per prenderla
Ed ora era tardi, troppo tardi per me e lei
Dopodomani sarò a Milano alle sei
Per dirgli ""non ce l'ho fatta"", che non ho i soldi
Per prendermi due colpi e pareggiare i conti
Un cerchio sopra di me, i loro volti mentre è a te che penso
Mentre crepo e vado all'inferno, leggi il biglietto
Ho messo i soldi in un doppiofondo, un tramonto
Tu in spiaggia che ridi girando in tondo, poi nulla
Tu in spiaggia che ridi girando in tondo, poi nulla
Tu in spiaggia che ridi girando in tondo, poi nulla

Abituarsi a non aspettarsi più niente di nuovo
Abituarsi a sentirsi solo
Sempre, semplicemente, fingere niente
E gente come formiche, porta molliche, sempre più piccole
E non è una guerra se non si può vincere

Come gli attori nei cartelloni
Chiedo: ""È così che dev'essere un uomo?""
Solo favori per altri favori
Forse è così, non esiste altro modo
Come siamo arrivati fin qui? O è sempre stato così?
Credo solo al segnale orario, in radio, se guardo in tele il TG

Sono ferita, mi hai quasi uccisa, sono la voce che suggeriva
Quando le notti io ti tenevo sveglio, tu mi tenevi pulita
Eri un illuso, forse hai dovuto
Non vuoi fidarti più di nessuno
E il segnale che ora mandi alla gente
Suona come un disturbo incomprensibile

[Pre-Hook: Marracash]
In ogni città, seduti in un bar
Mandiamo in silenzio un segnale che fa
E anche se cerchi, anche se tenti
Non c'è risposta al segnale che fa

Sospetto che mi prendano un campione di sangue
Ma non c'è, ma non c'è, ma non c'è, ma non c'è

Musica dà, musica toglie
La vita è una troia, veniamo al mondo per soddisfarne le voglie
Aspetto che i fantasmi vengano e mi prendano
Pensiamo troppo intensamente e gli altri sentono
Il vuoto tra le mani, Dio pensa nel genio
Sogna nel poeta e dorme tra gli infami

Così se sono il più bravo, cazzo, è oggettivo
Il capitalismo mi ha reso competitivo
E non c'è schiavo più grande di chi pensa di essere libero
E in un mondo in cui la parola non conta niente
È normale annuire ad un altro sapendo che mente
Indurirsi, diventare freddi e taglienti
L'ambiente opera e lascia i ferri dentro i pazienti
Dov'è questo potere dell'amore?
Se poi è l'amore per il potere che consuma le persone

Sapete peraltro che l'alcol e droga hanno segnato tutta la sua vita
Una morte, la sua, che ricorda peraltro anche
Come Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, come Jim Morrison
È crollata sul palco, esanime, tra i fischi dei fan inferociti

Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
In radio gira sempre una mia canzone
Chissà dov'era tutto questo amore
Quando soffrivo, quand'ero vivo
Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
Bruciare il santo e fare la processione
A cosa serve tutto questo onore
Se non ero un mito quand'ero vivo?

Prima di chiudere, una notizia che è arrivata proprio poco
Poco prima dell'inizio del telegiornale
È stata trovata morta 
Non riusciva neanche a star dietro ai musicisti, non si reggeva più neanche in piedi

Su dieci che mi amano quattro mi odiano e uno mi sfotte
Il successo non ti rende più forte
Mi sono fatto come un cane ieri notte
Le belle canzoni le scrive chi soffre
Per dormire ho preso una boccetta intera
Adesso vedo un poliziotto e una cameriera
Vedo me stesso morto sul pavimento
Di quest'hotel a tre stelle e mezzo dopo un concerto
Mi giro e sono in conferenza stampa
Radio e TV presenti in massa
Anche chi non mi passava una traccia
Intervistano perfino mia mamma
Ancora sotto shock, che piange come da programma
Ora la casa discografica investe davvero
Fa la pubblicità che prima gli chiedevo
Persino in rete nessuno odia o dice che fingevo

Oggi, la musica tutta s'inchina alla fine di un grande talento
Ci sono molti santi di dio
Il cantautore si suicidò in una camera dell'hotel Savoia, lasciando questo biglietto d'addio

Perché? È la domanda questa
Un proiettile è l'ultima cosa che mi è passata per la testa
Bang, è entrato dalla bocca è uscito da un orecchio
Il processo inverso di quando cantavo un testo
Non mi è mai piaciuto molto guardarmi allo specchio
I fans mi amavano più di quanto amassi me stesso
Depresso, scrivevano, ha bisogno d'aiuto
Se non somiglia a nessuno deve avere un disturbo
Spararsi è come confessarsi, ammettere di essere anormali
E ora perdonatemi tutti i peccati
Che pena, si fingerà mio amico ogni collega
Gente che da vivo sopportavo a malapena
E qualcuno c'ha basato una carriera intera
Se eravate i miei amici dov'eravate quella sera?
È strano il destino, da divo a divino
Incido più sul mondo ora che coi dischi che ho inciso

Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
In radio gira sempre una mia canzone
Chissà dov'era tutto questo amore
Quando soffrivo, quand'ero vivo
Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome

(Io non, io non) io non dico a te come evitare le manette
(Tu tu tu) tu non dire a me come devo fare il rapper

È facile non fare certe scelte se nessuno te le ha offerte
Insultare me non renderà migliore te
Vai a rapinare le banche se sei così gangster
Perché non farai mai i soldi col rap (mai)
Ne hai viste tante, non sai raccontarle, non hai flow, né poesia
Non sei interessante
Sai che le botte fanno male, le lame sanguinare
Ma le tue parole non mi possono toccare
C'è sempre chi chiede, ""chi conosci in quartiere?""
Dico He-Man, l’uomo invisibile e Biancaneve
So chi sono, voi chi siete? Ansie segrete
Bimbi impauriti, Hänsel e Gretel
È il mio film, Wim Wenders vado più su Messner
Nel rap italiano sono Mark, Mark Lenders
Da macho a machete, macchiette
Dal viaggio di fare il pagliaccio alle vere manette

E se venite nei quartieri e volete fare i rappers è anche grazie a me
Per tutti quelli che vogliono fare i criminali al microfono
La strada si fa in strada
Questa è musica
Conta la musica, zio
Heh, non è una gara a chi fa più brutto
Non è una gara a chi è più duro
Sinceramente non ce ne fotte un cazzo

No, non agitarti, resta immobile
Puoi metterci anni, e guardare ogni cosa che
Affonda nelle sabbie mobili
Si perde, nelle sabbie mobili

Penso spesso che, potrei farlo (sì)
Andare via di punto in bianco, cosi, altra città, altro stato (ah)
Potrei se avessi il coraggio
Ho un orizzonte limitato, è follia stare qua
È miraggio (follia), che basti essere capaci
Quanti ne ho visti scavalcarmi (ah), rampolli (ah), rapaci (ah), raccomandati
Quanti ne ho visti fare viaggi, e dopo non tornare (ah)
E restare (ah), spaccare (ah) e affermarsi
Qui non c'è il mito di chi si è fatto da solo
Perché chi si è fatto da solo di solito è corrotto
Se sei un ragazzo ambizioso in un sistema corrotto
Non puoi fare il botto e non uscirne più sporco (ah)
Nessuno lascia le poltrone, niente si muove (zero)
Nessuno osa e nessuno da un'occasione (sì)

Vale più il mio testo letto in diretta da Linus (sì)
Il paese ha un virus, una paralisi da ictus

Madonna, potrebbe essere mia nonna
A cinquanta anni ancora a pecorina
È il nulla, come la storia infinita
Come la mummia che si sveglia e torna in vita, puzza di muffa
The Beautiful People, The Beautiful People
La bella gente pratica il cannibalismo, sa di già visto
Come un film di cui capisci la fine già dall'inizio
E i vecchi stanno al potere, non vanno all'ospizio
Se MTV sta per Music Television
Vorremmo più video e meno reality e fiction (ah)
Sono pesante apposta come chi fa sumo
E tu fai musica che piace a tanti e non fa impazzire nessuno

Affonda nelle sabbie mobili

Niente di nuovo, niente di che (oh)
Quel rapper che ti piace non dice niente di sé (oh)
Solo cliché, attacca il premier
Come se quando cadrà il premier vincerà il bene
Se non ci fosse, di che parlerebbe?
Chi comanda è lì da sempre, e non si elegge con il voto
E prende decisioni senza cuore e senza quorum
E se tornassi indietro io lo rifarei
Il mio incubo era fare la vita dei miei
Sì, quella vita strizzata, in otto ore compressa
La sera sei stanco, c'hai mal di testa, compressa
Fuori onda il direttore dice che ho ragione
Ma non ci crede, come chi brinda ma poi non beve
Non prendere la bufala, che tanto non è bufala, è una bufala

Se riesci sei un genio, se fallisci sei uno zero
E se fai quello che fanno gli altri rischi di meno, quindi

Questo è il giorno del giudizio, questo è l’Armagideon

Con prezzi ben superiori ai compensi
Frate' non pensi che qualche tale compensi
Con qualche affare
Compresi noi (io e Achille)

Io e Achille tipo bis di stili, biz di kili
Tris di primi, auto-distruttivi
Non tratto con i distintivi, istintivi
Ho tratti distintivi mai visti in TV (puf)
Nato in un'anfora
Nelle gole di Alcantara
I miei non hanno scopato
Ma strofinato una lampada
Ho chiesto a un bimbo chi era Cristo
E m'ha detto una statua
Spacchiamo tutto come Crisso e Spartaco a Capua
Se vi scuoto cadono le bugie
Vieni dopo tutte le gerarchie
Maschilista non diciamo eresie
Queste arpie vogliono il cazzo, 'fra
Non le mie poesie

Boy, sei invitato al party in spiaggia, che farò?
Porta tutti i testi che facciamo il falò
Se i tuoi hanno i soldi non parlarmi di hardcore
Quando giro coi miei amici faccio un cazzo di show 
Faccio un cazzo di show
Faccio un cazzo di show
Se ti fermano gli sbirri con 'sto swag
Non dire che l'hai preso me

Se eri in prima fila che sei in cima al lato te
Se ripenso a come tutto era prima
Che immaginavo solo furto e rapina
È quasi come fossi morto

Mamma tuo figlio con gli occhi più grandi della pancia
Andavi a pulire a casa di una compagna
Che fingevamo fosse casa nostra
E ognuno avesse la sua stanza
Ricordi che ti giuravo
Che prima o poi mi avresti visto e sentito in radio
Perché a tenermi un posto fisso non ero in grado
Divido con chi c'era lì quando digiunavo

Mi piaci perché sei diverso
Deragliamo insieme dalle rotaie
Su cui vorrebbero che stessimo
Così insicuro che mi davo delle arie
Non mi agghindavo come adesso
Come ridevi che volevo rappare
Non mi piaceva quello scherzo
Ti ricordi quando ad andare in centro ci sentivamo intrusi
Poi conquistare disobbediendo e coprendo il mondo di sputi
È umiliante provare tanto non ci faranno entrare là

Tu e un mio amico fate affari insieme
E a vederti un po' di più in quartiere
A poco a poco in tre tutte le sere
Attratti da te e dal tuo mestiere
Dal tuo rifiutarti di cadere
Perché a casa mia si urlava e basta e c'era la rassegnazione invece

Non giudico mai le tue scelte e sto zitto se parli con gente
Durante consegne ogni giorno a firmare alle sette

Ti dico la rollo
La fumiamo mentre portiamo giù Lollo
Ma appena noi scesi giù lungo la strada
Ci fermano e salgono, perquisa in casa
Cercano ovunque: vani e cassetti, intercapedini in delle pareti
Tu che ti sbracci, ti agiti e neghi
Io solo so dove la tieni!
Leggevi quelle lettere, forse solo io ti ho visto piangere
Frate, perché oltre a mantenerti, avevi sulle spalle un padre in carcere
Piangi di nervoso contro un destino che sembra abbia già deciso
Sono fortunato con una famiglia, e solo lì l'ho capito!
Ho tirato con te al sacco
Frate sei salito sul mio palco

E sembra che ogni notte l'inferno ci apra le porte
Un po' per lavoro, un po' per svago ci diamo forte
Tra me e te, solo case popolari ininterrotte
Dividevamo pane, lusso e discussioni profonde
Quante volte ripetevi che quella sostanza era una porcheria?
Dicevi sia solo un sfizio, ma è un vizio che diventa una malattia
La tua pazzia, veniva fuori nelle depressioni fra' del giorno dopo
L'odio che sai controllare da sobrio
Ma quando sei fatto ti rende un demonio
Scatti di ira feroci
Spacchi teste come noci
Scappan veloci
Tu testa a testa che scazzi pure coi miei amici e i miei soci

E prego la tua stella
Tu troppo grande per una cella
Avrei voluto scrivere una conclusione più bella
A volte da un'altra madre nasce un fratello
E a volte tra tanto male nasce un gioiello

Ma hanno in comune soltanto il dottore
 
Cose noiose ti scoccia che te ne parlo
Vorresti essere a un tavolo con la boccia nel ghiaccio
Tutti che fanno Jersey Shore tutti così estroversi
Poi dove conta più esserci, che divertirsi tanto

Mi chiamano fuoco per il vuoto che ho lasciato

Perché odio odio odio

Tra noi che cambia? 
Io ho arredato meglio la mia gabbia 
Orientali si occidentalizzano, sorpassi
Il mondo cambia
Occidentali provano a orientarsi
L'Italia perde il PIL e non il vizio
Si chiudono più affari nei salotti che in ufficio
Non vi siete accorti tutto il mondo ride per non piangere? 
Fanno i conti in tutto il mondo muori per un margine
Maneggia con cura la mia anima che è fragile
Apri gli occhi perché chiuderli è moto più facile (lo fanno tutti)
Per quelli dei locali i ragazzi sono paganti
Di certo siete artisti a postare e a fotografarvi
Ho scelto di levarmi, di elevarmi, di non allearmi
Di allevarvi il viaggio e dopo anni dirvi: alle armi! 

Scrivo una canzone senza titolo
Ieri sono uscito ed ho incontrato Dio in un vicolo
Oggi scendere dal letto è andare sul patibolo
Alternare l'euforia e la perdita di stimolo
E metto in mostra la forza che ho
Non sono un uomo sono un simbolo
Non lascerò che Fabio un uomo tormentato comprometta il risultato una altra volta, no
La tua paura prova solo che il coraggio esiste
Troppo impegnato a viverlo per scriverlo su Twitter
Mi chiedo ora quanto ancora in la mi posso sporgere
Guardo le stelle come se potessero rispondere
Durante un temporale ho visto la spina dorsale del cielo
Stavo conciato male, pero c'ero! 
La verità mi è entrata in casa quasi di soppiatto
Le ho detto di restare ferma e le fatto un ritratto
Mi hai portato in posti dove mai ero stato prima
Leggi il mio volto come una cartina
Dividiamoci il mio cuore tipo l'ultima siga
Ho aspettato a scrivere di te fino quasi l'ultima rima
È strano fra', l'amore ci imbarazza
Chi lo mette in piazza di solito
Pensa a quanto mette in tasca
Se queste frasi non sono abbastanza e manca il titolo
È perché per descriverlo la parola non basta

Ammalarsi di una donna
Tra le spire fra, Anaconda
Come so che sei davvero tu? 
E non una bella menzogna
Noi due corpi e solo un ombra
Il mio respiro che si accorcia
Ora so che sei davvero tu
E qualcosa resterà

E metto a nudo le paure che ho
Non sono un uomo sono un simbolo
Lasciare che il mio personaggio uccida Fabio o peggio che lo renda schiavo un'altra volta no",Untitled,2015

Baby se non vuoi fare, che sali a fare? 
Realizzato che questa non prende come la 3
Faccio un club sandwich e poi faccio un sandwich al club
Voglio stare al top solo per non vederci te
Questi armadi in giacca Armani fanno affari con me
La tua storia non mi è nuova, è che ero io e non te
Non parlare a me di swag, sto sull'Uomo Vogue, nuovo flow

Quando esce il tuo disco non se ne accorge nessuno
Il mio lo attendono come i parenti di un detenuto

Ti smontano l'auto a tempo record, tipo Pit Stop

Pagami in sessanta secondi, altro che sessanta giorni
Ho messo il cash già nel nome come nei Sessanta Johnny
Mia madre piange, ultimamente non mi vede bene
Allora sono uscito e le ho comprato un'altra tele
Io non ho figli però ho un tenore da mantenere
Non ho bagagli e ho idee troppo grandi per 'sto Paese

A tutto questo perché frutto della passione

Se canto con Malika metto d'accordo la critica
Ma giusto una canzone, l'azione la vedo critica
E invece Baby K? Le insegnerei a rappare
In una cosa a tre con Bianca Atzei, mi darei da fare
Bè, Dolce Nera è un gran bel pezzo
Non ci faccio un pezzo

Ho più di un hermano de leche, perso per mano di legge
Prendi ogni problema in tempo e punisci ogni comportamento oltraggioso
Perché il coraggio fratè è contagioso
Muta un moccioso in un cane rognoso
Alta la guardia, la strada ti guarda, sente un infame fra come Pachanga
Pensa che hai perso le palle in casanza o appresso a te non guadagna abbastanza
Ho sempre scelto di ingoiare sangue piuttosto che ingoiare orgoglio
Sono un superstite però ho buchi di proiettili sopra il mio sogno
Svegliato brusco di primo mattino, però sono vivo
Tiro un bel respiro
Sì, solo gli sbirri se vengono a prenderti fanno tutto 'sto casino

Se vuoi fare Tony, li devi far fuori, sopporti pressioni
Reprimi emozioni, investigazioni sotto i palazzoni
Gli sbirri coi droni, investi in azioni, cattive intenzioni
Se vuoi fare Tony sei senza padroni pensando ai milioni

Quando esci portati le palle
Entro al club, scendo dall’astronave
Queste fighe tutte a digitare
Questo iPhone è coca digitale
Ad occhi chiusi faccio fresca
Senza mani tipo Tesla
Scendo in strada come a Caracas
La scopo e canta come la Callas
Passano gli anni e divento più grosso come il cavallino di Polo
Nel 2006 avevo già i denti d’oro
Dici “Gué Pequeno, trovami un lavoro”
Il mio fratellino mira alla testa
Ti fa un pallino rosso induista
Penso alla fresca, solo alla fresca
Divento grande, tipo bar mitzvah
Panca piana, quattro serie
Con il bilanciere la tua puttana
La tua vita in mano come dal barbiere
Che tu sei seduto e dietro con la lama
Nelle celle, nelle strade, nei locali, fra, nei macchinoni
Senti la mia voce, segno della croce

Voglio ridere come non avessi mai pianto
Voglio la luna e camminarci sopra come Armstrong

Portami sulle onde dell'oceano quando si alzano

Quello che è peggio non ricordo più quello che ho perso
In un paese dove onesto rima con modesto
Tutto è piatto e tu ti sorprendi se io ci stendo
Fuori carri e carnevali, dentro carri armati
I miei amici vaporizzati, gialli a Nagasaki
Questo intestino è in 24 carati
Stati d'animo in centoquaranta caratteri
E non so chi tu pensi io sia
La realtà non è all'altezza della fantasia
Certe idee che mi accarezzano e che scaccio via
Un brivido che faccia breccia nella mia apatia
Non sei più mia e ti trovo male
Il tuo nuovo ragazzo ti invecchia
Ma resti bella e triste come il paesaggio a Venezia
E non avrò paura se saremo insieme
Una morte dolce, come una mosca che affoga nel miele

Fallo mentre mi guardi negli occhi

I'm in the palm of her hands

Mars Bonfire,"Ahh, how you gonna make it, baby?
That's the question to be asked
Life goes on around you
In so many different ways
I know my share of history
How hard it is to be free
From wearing masks that turn to skin
Hiding what could have been

[Chorus]
And I, I I'm so confused
Which way, which way to choose

Don't buy dreams too easily
They're never what they seem to be
I want to sweep confusion clear
And never turn it back for me

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

The astronaut who goes in space
I, I'd like to take his place
His imagination's free
From the force of gravity
Take photographs and tape recordings
Play them back and try to find
If there is life on other worlds
And do they have a message

[Chorus]

If I climbed higher than the sun
Looked into the universe
Back on Earth, I'd never speak
Just smile at everyone

Ride with me, baby
Til the end of the day

Popping pills just gets you busted
And the prophets were unwise
A beautiful thing has fallen through
With cancer, death and poverty
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sanest of us all?
Is he with me or one of them
How does he dress, who are his friends?

[Chorus]

Can I have my vision back?
I live outside the city walls
You don't have to be afraid of me
Until I come together

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

Mama's home philosophy
Makes everyone a freak but me
She says that grandma's hated you
And sends me all her love
I left home with sad goodbyes
Mama sits alone and cries
You can always count on us
Sorry, please come home

(chorus)

I write home I'm doin' fine
But it's just to ease her mind
'Cause I'm starving in the street
And can't predict the future

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

So many ways of living life
And each one has evangelists
Who say they've found the only way
And want it all to go astray
I can't got time to live 'em all
So which one am I gonna choose
You know that I don't wanna lose
The promise of adventure

[Chorus]

The funeral procession passes
Yes, I'm really twenty-one
People expect great things of me
The man of the year whose time has come

Ride with me, baby
'Til the end of the day

A moment's happiness in life
Is vaporized within the night
The lover that I had last week
Has kicked me out the door
I wrench in terror a plastic player
Of attitudes and old taboos
That keep me cold, outside of you
Trying to jump your fences

I'll soon find out what you want with me
I hope you'll be the last on Earth
Can't build a future in my head
That can't exist in time

Ride with me, baby

Mars Ill,"HOOK:
Why is it more that things change the more they stay the same?
Why do old people drive slow in the fast lane?
Why is it when I grab the mic you stare at me strange?

Why's every time I eat I get my shirt stained? (dang!)
Wassup Tremaine, what, your name's Wayne?
Dang man, why can't I just remember people's names?
All the same there's a question in my mind
Why do I have to wait in line just to wait in another line
And when I think I'm done I gots to do it one more time?
Why oh why am I always stuck behind
The lady who has writes a check in the express check out line?
Excuse me miss, it's 10 items not 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
Why do most rappers they just spit the same rhymes?
Why do girls go to the bathroom at the same time?
Why when something's wrong I just say I'm fine?
But why ask why when I ask it all the time?

CHORUS:
Why is the grass green? Why's the sky blue?
Why oh why do I do what I do?
Can you please tell me why that is cause I don't have a clue?
Now why is that? I was about to ask you.
Why am I me? and why are you you?
Why do we run in circles chasing after nothing new?
Somebody won't you please tell me why because I haven't got a clue?
Yo why is it my man? I was about to ask you.

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do the voices in my head get louder when I try to sleep?
Why can't I seem to count all the leaping sheep?
I'm knee deep in distribution, retail, paperwork, and e-mail.
Why can't I afford a secretary to handle office detail?
Why are prices high, water wet, people cruel?
Why does every single record exec try to play me for the fool?
Why don't bar stools have backs? Do they want the drunks to fall off?
And why do we have to fill up all the precious silence with small talk?
Why do we all walk with our heads down and walkmans up to ten?
Are we afraid to let a stranger in every now and then?
Why do sucker emcees spit loud and claim to be the hardest
And then sit down to write their rhymes with a dictionary plus a thesaurus?
Why does the commerce strangle art instead of the other way around?
I guess it's hard to work the angles when the cipher's always round.
Why do we drown our sorrow, reach both hands out for tomorrow
When just living today is hard enough to swallow? Why?

CHORUS

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do conceptual song structures cramp my style and hand alike?
Why do organized emcee battles make wack rappers grab the mic?
Why am I here, cause the instruction manual wasn't clear?
Why does my transmission make that sound when I try to shift it's gears?
Why is my stereo so loud? Do I want all neighbors to hear?
Am I my own street team member try to catapult my career?
Why does a dog bark, bee sting, bird sing?
But first things first, why do you burn my album with left hands on your purse string?

(KJ)
Why do we disrespect each other instead of loving one another?
Why do we have to focus on the skin tone and color?
Why can't we see that we sisters and we brothers
And understand we all equal to God and plus He loves us?
Bust this. Ima say this just again and again.
Why oh why can't we all be friends?
But there's one things I just can't comprehend.
Why do they put Braille at a drive-up ATM?
I guess that's for all the car driving blind men.
Why do we just hate God but really love to sin?
Really, man, shouldn't that be just the other way around?
Why do I always have to laugh when somebody falls down?
Why do things get worse when they're already going wrong?
Why's customer service put me on hold for so long?
Why do you tell me to hold on when I'm already holding on?
Why can't we all just get along?

CHORUS

Why does fast food take so long to get it?
Why do people fart in public and say someone else did it?
Why do you ask my opinion but get mad when I give it?
And why ask for wisdom if you ignore the Holy Spirit?
Now check the lyrics cause this might apply to you.
Dude, why's brushing your teeth just like so hard for you?
Now if your breath stank, don't be be saying ""Hi, how are you?""
If I give you a breath mint, don't be like, ""No, thank you.""
Get a clue, now tell me why your clothes is fake, too.

Why do you say it's FUBU when ya know it's PUBU?
And why do you say yes when you really mean no?
Why do you tell me to stop when you really mean go?
Why's the bad choice the one choice I always chose?
But in spite of how I acted, why did God love me so
Much the He would just pay the price of my soul?
But I don't need to ask why. I already know.

Mars Ill,"Honey, I'm home! Where's my dinner? And this place is a mess
And less than adequate, marked with laziness and soap-opera watching
Clean it top to bottom now or face the consequences
Stop that sentence, I don't really want to hear your feedback
Smack the taste out of your loud mouth now
Sweetheart, the game is on and you just fouled out
How about a little affection thrown in my direction honey?
Yeah, I'm sorry for the way I yelled about the money that I lost
Gambling last night, but you must be on the crack pipe
If you think I'ma let a woman take that tone with me
And I know they cut the phone, see? But I wasn't trying to hear it
I didn't mean to break your face, I just wanted to break your spirit
And your arm the night before, I thought we agreed that was an accident
Now the neighbors called the cops on some old assault and battering
And I'm a man of my word and all my words got 4-Letters
The door is that way, but you'll never do any better than me
This is my house, I'm the man, I rule with the hand of fear
You don't like it? Get out! Now go get me another beer
Did I make myself clear? Don't make me say it twice
I worked a double shift last night and don't got time to play it nice
As for the lipstick on my collar, well that's my business
You're my wife and all that, but let's face it. You got your limits
You're dependent on this bread winner 'cause you're barefoot and pregnant
I'm a part of your life til I decide to make my exit...

He's the alpha, the top of the pile, the leader of the pack
You'll listen when he talks because he's got it like that
Matter fact he rules with iron fist, gripping misfortune
He learned to be a man from his father before him
Yeah, he's the alpha, the first person in every universe
Version 5.0 pack animal with blood thirst and stamina
The root of family trees where so many have fallen
He'll provide for your needs, but please proceed with caution
The Alpha...

Now I was called long ago to grow to be a man
And show the ones before and after me so maybe they could understand
And know the facts that with power, responsibility's attached
And the appropriate response isn't always to react
And attack the weakness of beautiful creatures 'cause we can't
It's our duty to implant wisdom and patience in our stance
And it's true that woman was made from man's rib, so oddly
When you sin against your wife, you sin against your own body
And an open fisted beatdown is never an option for mine
For she was made in God's image, so I'm inclined to put her desires
And needs before me daily and see my lady as a queen
Her submission is a calling that isn't enforced by me
Cause I'm free from a GQ
Maxim
Playboy establishment
Christ is the man I strive to be like and that's no accident
My dad implanted the fuel and the means that I found vital
If your father was a deadbeat or absent, you can break the cycle
Take the Bible and tradition and follow the map accordingly
Spread the answers I've found around the world
I'll firmly lead my household and display emotions openly
And show my people what a real man's supposed to be...

Cause I'm the Alpha, called and destined, the leader of the pack
I'll listen when you talk because I've got it like that
Matter fact, I'll protect you with my life because I love you
And carry you on my back through everything we have to trudge through
The Alpha, first person in every universe
Version 6.0, sacrifice my body to the dirt
I challenge Alpha Males to change so you can see
A man standing there where a boy used to be
The Alpha...

Mars Williams,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Marsalis Family,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same ""Dogg Food"" album bangin in my tape deck
Homey if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I woulda told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I woulda cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

I woulda told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Woulda told V to stay sober
When niggas ""Beg for Mercy,"" that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I woulda changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source suckin Benzino's dick
Tryin to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Do something positive it never get mentioned

I'm black just like the Panthers lookin' for an answer
This prejudice shit is like cancer

Look at my cars they stay gettin' pulled over
I'm black, meanin' Public Enemy's number one
Government lookin' in the hood sendin' in the guns

[Verse 1: Nas]
Felon, fights behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs my anthology on perfection
Dress superb admired by conspirists
Who wanna try me but ain't high enough to 4-5 me up
Child of the 80s, y'all niggas is lazy
Complainin' 'bout labor pains nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game light another L pass the bottle
Pro-black I don't pick cotton out a aspirin bottle
Yeah I learned my lessons and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with narcs confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on my niggas I'll bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show them my fortunes but can't force 'em think rich
And still I'm out on the boarder wonderin' if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray the feds let Murder Inc. live

[Verse 2: The Game]
'Pac is watchin' B.I.G. is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin' I was supposed to be
Amongst kings my mom shouted out at my christenin'
And while you still listenin' Shyne locked in a manhole
And Cam got shot inside his Lambo it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindle the flame Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown clown I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted
Showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down wit' it
Now the ball's in my court never dribble out of bounds wit' it
Behind the back to Nas he alley oop to Jigga nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
Check it, Me and Nasty puffin it's a classic trust me
How he gon' pass the dutchie to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see The Doctor's Advocate drop
Flop I think not, I fuck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my trainin' wheels off it's curtains
I don't need no encore no claps no cheers
The Game ain't over this the beginning of my career
The endin' of yours the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga it's Game time that was Dre's favorite line
Back when Proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't B.I.G. and I ain't 'Pac we just eatin' off rap
One love

You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same ""Dogg Food"" album bangin in my tape deck
Homey if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I woulda told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I woulda cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

I woulda told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Woulda told V to stay sober
When niggas ""Beg for Mercy,"" that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I woulda changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source suckin Benzino's dick
Tryin to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that

Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face

But we still get together like every several years
To sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with grey eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? - cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate

I'm in the record shop with choices to make
""Illmatic"" on the top shelf, ""The Chronic"" on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off ""Illmatic"" and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""
Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned""
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga

I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes - of Cuban cigars, you fooling with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that ""Soul Plane"" movie's the bomb

You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting

All of my options, I gotta get me plenty more

Go, get you some
Don't stop, nigga, we ain't done, gun it through your fuckin' road block

A lot of niggaz shit sound dated
I'm like Shaq, franchise player just got traded
To the number one team in the league
See I ain't on J. Records, I'm on Dre Records, Aftermath, bitch

You need to learn 'cause you ain't knowin' the half, bitch
And while I'm gone I'm puttin' dough in the stash, bitch
So new and fresh I say it again
So what it do, don't test see I'ma blaze to the end
I'm comin' through, so confess you niggaz know who the kid
I'm like a newborn nigga, that's securing a win

So new and so current and they hate this
The streets'll classify in another level of greatness
I'm here to fix up the game, I'm givin' it a facelift
New and improved, watch the way, I make the game shift
Now watch me swing it out the ballpark
I come to shut it down, don't let the war start while I come to get the

Money, cars, clothes, sexy broads, plenty more
Go, get you some

Whether I'm poor or rich, or rich or poor
Though its all the same shit
(I'm black)
Even though my skins kind of light
That means my ancestors was raped by somebody white
(I'm black)
So I like to sing dance and crack jokes
Eat good food and be around black folks
(I'm black)
Sort of like the Holy's on Sundays
Drink all night and still go to work Monday
(I'm black)
So I like the kids looking real nice
Cause I've been poor and I know what it feels like
(I'm black)
And I'ma say it loud like James Brown
People be proud cause we all up in the game now
(I'm black)
And I'ma hold my right fist real high
Might see my man and we might get real high
(I'm black)
And I know it, and I ain't afraid to show it
(I'm black)
And I'm the genius in the motherfuckin' Poet
You know it

(Oh oh)

[Chorus]
So proud to be just who I am
So proud to say that I'm me
So proud to be just who I am
So proud to be so free
(I'm black)
So proud to say that I made it
(I'm black)
The one who struggled in the hatred
(I'm black)
And I'm not afraid to say it
(I'm black, cause I know I'm Sinking)

(I'm black)
So I gotta heart full of bravery
Do for my peoples that went through Slavery
(I'm black)
So you know I'm young in the sports
Ninety percent chanced I get hung in the Court
(I'm black)
Don't you be scared of me Mister
Cause you don't really seem to be scared of my sister
(I'm black)
And I can ride first class too
Or buy an exotic car and like murk past you
(I'm black)
And I don't need a tan in the winter
Mind strong and powerful now a cypher can't enter
(I'm black)
And I don't need jewelry to shine
Look in my skin color is like the jewelry is blind
(I'm black)
They focus on the negative attention
Do something positive, and never get mentioned
(I'm black)
Listen it's a fact, original man
I wouldn't change it if I could and that's that

So proud to be just who I'am
So proud to say that I'm me
So proud to be just who I'am
So proud to be so free

So proud to say that I made it

And I'm not afraid to say it

(I'm black, I'm black, oh, yeah, yeah)

(I'm black)
Even with a caramel complexion
Look in the mirror see Malcolm and Martin reflection
(I'm black)
Just like the panther, looking for an answer
It's prejudice shit is like a cancer
(I'm black)
Look in my eyes the wall can't get pulled over
Look in my cars and stay gettin pulled over
(I'm black)
Me the public enemies number one
Government looking in the hood sending in the gun
(I'm black)
I grew up off the good time show
Drink liquor smoke weed and let the good times roll
(I'm black)
I live for my wife and my seeds
And my mom with a bond only God can acceed
(I'm black)
I got to show my homeboys love
First thing you learned in the hood is homeboy love
(I'm black)
And I'm mad if I ain't nothin' else
(I'm black)
I'm beautiful and I love myself (Say together)
Yeah! (Love myself, oh yeah)

So proud to be just who I am
So proud to say that I'm me,

Marsha Ambrosius,"So I'm watchin' her fine ass
Walk to my bedroom, and thought to myself
That's the shape of things to come
She said, ""Why you in the club, you don't make it precipitate?
You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm""
I'm like, ""Why?
The world needs sun
The hood needs funds
There's a war going on and half the battle is guns""
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore, got a cord
Umbilical attached to a place that can't afford
No landscaping, or window draping
This old lady told me
If I ain't got nothin' good, say nothing
That's why I don't talk much
I swear it don't cost much, to pay attention to me
I tell like it is, and I tell it how it could be
The hood be
Requesting my services, oh don't get nervous it's
Step yo game up time, these ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancin' in some club
Niggas ride to me
Woman be up in they tub
Exfoliating with hey pom poms
Yellin' go 3000!
I'm in my whatever bumpin' mois
A 100 miles in
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Summon

Cummin'
Sit down, heard you need some plumbing
Done in
I'm in
A swell mood
A rather swole mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That she'll be back, she's going to the store
I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door
I pointed her to
I said, ""Call me when y'all break up
I don't fuck nobody bitch
And never own a Jacob, know what time it is""
Nigga just tryin' to live
Like a nigga supposed to live
If I still drink that malt liquor
I pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around
I started off starvin'
Now they got me out here Brett Farve'n
Tryna see if I still got it (got it)
I guess it's like a bike think about it (oh oh oh no no)

Marsha Ambrosius,"Looks like things ain't gonna work out 
Quite the way we planned, 
Got your bags at the door 
And now you're leaving me again. 
I play cool like I don't care, 
That's just the way I am; 
But inside I wish I had the nuts 
To ask you for another chance. 
All I do is wish for you now 
That you are gone, time should heal, 
Pain should fade and I should move on

But it still hurts, still burns. 
When it comes to love I got a lot to learn 
Ain't comin' back like I want you to
Baby there's no gettin' over you 
Cause it still hurts, it still burns

I smile when I look back 
On the way we were before, 
Remember the life I had in love 
When I was your girl. 
Nowhere was as lovely 
As our own little world, 
I can't believe I messed up, 
I can't believe I'm not your girl. 

Cause all I do is dream of you now 
That you are gone, 
But time should heal and pain should fade 
And I should move on

But it still hurts, still burns. 
When it comes to love I got a lot to learn 
Ain't comin' back like I want you to,
Baby there's no gettin' over you 
Cause it still hurts, it still burns

I try to fight away this hold you have on me, 
Baby I kick, I scream, 
Baby I've tried everything. 
But I'm hopeless ya see, 
Stuck on a love that used to be, 
Chasing a dream that maybe 
Baby you would come back to me.. 

But it still hurts, still burns.

Ain't comin' back like I want you to,
Baby there's no gettin' over you

Marsha Ambrosius,"If I told you I wanted to talk to you,
You think I'm try'na holla at you,
And maybe I am but,
You wouldn't hear me out anyways would you? ,
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like,
Short days, long nights,
By the phone, no call,
Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind,got me goin' down that road,
Heart made of stone,
Far away from home,
Black woman you cold,
Every problem you ever had with another man I gotta face,
Started off on thin ice,
I'm still here but I can't skate,
Slow sink, can't breath, no remorse, don't think,
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat,
Queen, you deserve the title
But she rejects what I give,
While she nurse the wounds by them,
Tried them, didn't work,
Got impossible standards,
Nothing I'm a do is gon' work,
Diary of a black girl,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
I'm down and out,
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,
I don't know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out,
Somehow,

Raised by a momma who, who,
Hates her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with,
Saying fuck a nigga Quick, quick,
I'm just tryna be the one who never run,
But you run away from me,
Girlfriends man cheat, cheat,
Why not me the same thing,
She can't see in me, what I see in her,
This pain she inherit can't be reversed,
I can't even stay living in the shade
Of all the motherfuckers who played you,
The irony in that is that I ain't even that,
But you put in these pages,
Wife, you deserve the label
But, but, you been hurt before so you don't feel your able,
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards,
Nothing that I ever do works,
Diary of a black girl,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
I'm down and out,
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,
I don't know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out,
Somehow,

See all I wanna do is be relevant,
Just tell me that I ever meant anything more,
That you could ever see me and you in another light,
But its like the dark women indoors in the darkest nights by the wrong man,
See all of them have made you incapable of a first impression,
What it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna,
Just intentions to impress you if capable,
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you,
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind,
For such an ugly picture and,
Money, nothing I buy can buy more time
For your ears to tell your heart to listen to it,
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say
But believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways,
And everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary,
The day before is better than the present,
So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences,
There's no key for release,
No reason to be around,
Her minds in the clouds,
She writes it all down,
In her diary,

I wonder why I sit and cry,
Wish I could shed all these tears,
I'm down and out,
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,
I don't know how to move on,
Where I went wrong,
I wish I could live with no fear,
So down and out,
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out,

Please don't go, oh
I need you here to stay, I
Miss you so

My daddy left me, and he ain't even die
So when he did go, I ain't even cry
I had reason, but that ain't even why
How could he have failed if he ain't even try
I ask no questions, I ain't even pry
Truthfully I wanted to I can't even lie
Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly
To just walk away, like you ain't even my
Like, like, like I ain't even your
I cant even say it, I ain't even sure
He shoulda gave me everything and left me even more
But he left me without saying what he was leavin' for
And that's when I became a man
And that's the day he stopped bein' one
This year I became a father
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son

I have nightmares of me not bein' round
He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town
Daddy's entertaining everybody
But missed out when it came to trainin' for the potty
I give a fuck about hip-hops new beef
I was more excited when my son grew teeth
So I same the problem
Of the famous stardom
Just like Em and Haily
Just like Game and Harlem
Weezy's at the awards with Miss. Carter
Nah not his date, i'm talkin' bout his daughter
Now that's stuntin' like your daddy
Cause its crazy when you wanna be nothin' like your daddy
And if you never been a man
That's the day you start bein' one
This year I became a father
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son

So hear the truth remain to let me go
I wont hold that against you, I moved on
Just look what I become since you been gone
Now don't you turn away, oh, please don't go
Here's what I got to say, oh
Please don't go
oh why'd you go away, oh
Please don't go
I needed you here to stay, oh
Please don't go
I cant believe this day, oh

Yeah the grass aint greener on the other side of town,
Now look at how it all turned out now.
I'm a little bitter, just a little bitter but I'm doing better cause we ain't together.
Ya sorry excuse for somebody I was into
Remember what it was when I was with you.

Look at how it all turned out now (I hope she cheat on you with a basketball playa)
Look at how it all turned out now (I hope you're feeling lonely baby now were not together)

Marsha Ambrosius,"So sad to see you go so soon
I know that you ain't coming back
In the beginning everything was cool
Toward the end of it all it's all bad
I know I played my part in making it what it is
And I know that you did the same
I guess I'm up outta here
I'm moving on again
I'm sure that you will understand
I play by the rules
You play by the game
I couldn't of stayed
It's easier to say
'Cause I was by your side
When you went through the pain
I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Didn't want you to go babe, babe

Ooh tear stains on my pillow
Tryna forget ya
Don't know what I'm gonna do
More days and counting
I've been laying and staring
Myself in the mirror
All alone in my room
I can't feel this way again
Gotta think with my head
'Cause my heart is what got me here
So hurt from what you've done
More than enough reasons for me to move on
'Cause I gave you my word
You put your trust in me
Supposed to be the one to give you what you need
I was by your side
When we were meant to be
Guess it doesn't matter now that you're so

Far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Yeah

If I'd have known Sunday morning
That you would be gone
I would have never come home
I wouldn't have answered my phone
To hear the voice at your tone
I knew that something was wrong babe
The cops the one who had told me
That you was alone inside an empty room
Identified you as my baby
Oh my baby, so far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Yeah
Can't believe that you're gone

Back in my life why don't you baby
You ain't have to leave me boy

Marsha Ambrosius,"I can love you better
Lose myself in love

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is?

Couldn't tell me I was in love when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love
Should a told me I was worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is?

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said!
So I could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is

And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love
Yeah, so I can love you better baby lose myself in love
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Had to lose myself in love, so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby baby

Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player

And then I found peace it was really kind,
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right

Marsha Ambrosius,"I will change the game, one day
Change the game, one day

I got signed to Atlantic Records, 2004
They predicted I do a billion right outta the door
They said all I had to do was just follow the for-
-mula you does, and you gon' be popular boy
See, what they fail to realize is I rhyme for the cause
They got the same mindframe as (?)
Told me they needed a single, who should they call?
I said, ""y'all should put me in the stu' with Trey Songz""
Now all along they thinkin' we do a song how we bang the girls
I said, ""nah lil' nigga, we 'bout to change the world""
And when I turned it in, expecting a grin
They gave a nigga this look like, never again
And I looked back at them like never again
I love both you motherfuckers but, just as some friends
I can't do music if it ain't got a message within
I guess y'all can leave that up to the rest of them men
I'm changing the game

[Chorus]
I day dream 'bout money and fame
I will change the game
One day (it's just a silly game)
When everybody knows my name
I will change the game
One day (change the game, change the game)

Okay so now I got the Bentley dropped
But on the left side of my chest is an empty spot
I can't lie, these little groupies they tempt me a lot
But for me to fall victim, I simply could not
Nah nah, I don't brag about the bottles I pop
A lot of y'all are runnin' around here with the models I mop
5 years ago when Entourage was shot to the top
Suprised she still skinny, shorty swallows a lot
Ha ha! and ever so often
Somebody comes around and delivers great songs without flossin'
Without talkin', bout shit that isn't important
Like makin' a fortune off of somebody snortin'
Or bein' the forces that causes someone to coffin [?]
This is all we doin' with hip-hop, we lost it
And we should be ashamed of ourselves
The only people we can blame is ourselves, (who else?)

[Chorus]

I dare to dream, to be all I can be
For I am I
My imagination, I can do it all
I can do it all, do just what I want

I got released from Atlantic Records, 2010
I swear to God, I felt like I's gettin' outta the pen
It started off real good, but how will it end
Will I make it to the top or the tower again?
Will I be on Hot 9 or Power again?
Or will the people just assume that I'm sour within
I told my story to 40,000 people
Now it's time for me to get equal, the sequel

[Chorus]",The Game Changer,2012
Marsha Ambrosius,"Uh, clearly I made it, all of this hating
Show's over, it's a couple bad one waiting
Tryna get chosen, flown to a exotic destination
Smoking on something as strong as my vivid imagination
I don't see nothing wrong with love being naked
Out this world whips, my crib a space station
My life is a trip, my crib a vacation

Bright lights, big city
Big cars, you and me
So baby you can roll with me
I'll show you how it's supposed to be

Big stars, I'll spot ya
Be calm, I got ya
So baby let me take you there
Baby, let me take you there

Yellow gold my link, Coca Cola my mink
Louie pouch holding that stink, love what you think I came without it?
Never that, I keep a pack of papers in my pocket
Applaud all my hot shit, in them hoes mouths like gossip
Money old as Lou Gossett, dollar clocker
Too late for doctors, this dead on arrival
Baby recognize G when it's in her eye, yo
Boss up nigga, this is what she ride fo'
Nigga fooling in that 2-0 Tahoe
Sunroof half open and my eyes halfway closed
It's a movie 'round here baby, might see somebody famous
Niggas getting change but we won't let it change us
Jet Life the campaign, can't stop the reign
Had to put the top up on the Vanquish

I'm slanging raps off my iPad
Thinking back when High Times was a dime bag
We was smoking good, but it was all bad
Now we ride in that burgundy with the tan rag
If you ain't heard of me
A nigga guessin' that your internet services ain't working too good at yall pad
It's all good, I'll hand y'all a late pass
Bring you up to speed 'fore we get to moving too fast
Back when I maneuvered that Jag hard top coupe
I just knew I was cooler than these lil' dudes out doing it
I was just being patient, pimping, perfecting my groovy
Sitting in the jacuzzi, on that Bluray Scarface
Nigga thinking 'bout music, while I'm ?
And my girl in the vanity mirror, wiping off Mac lip gloss
Finna roll up a doobie, sincerely yours truly
They can't do nothing with me, they can't do nothing to me

Bright lights, big city
Big cars, you and me
So baby you can roll with me

Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spiritual, it's been great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because

I'm the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it's real, but I'm focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you're not in tune, no, you're not immune
No acclamation, no golden seal
You sick side, gotta flush it down
We talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain't nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you're out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you're gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That cock only think you punch him out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you're made to do
I got faith in you, you're gonna make it through
Cause you don't chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a thing to do
Won't taste no foods like they put you
No more wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vault
As long as you walk on the earth with that first got to make me proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are

Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I'm hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids right after school
Think it's hard, yeah, that's true
This is what I have to do

Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here

What we got is true they listen
Try to talk to gal but is real what I'm spitting
Call Christ by name but still ain't rising
Set to my lane but still ain't listening
Got ice in the vans we make so frigid
Still in the kill brain self when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don't stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain't living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanks Giving
We love that color 25% more like we like to face prison
But just because the president was black there's no racism?
Postracial? More like most racial
They hate for you disgraceful
Don't let them take you off your base, let them motivate you
Don't let it overtake you, so what another clause
Survive the storm but riding on the beach in the southern wild

Marsha Ambrosius,"As around the sun the earth know she's revolving
And the rose buds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate know love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing we'll grow older everyday
Just as all that's born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way you pay
Did you know that life is giving love a guarantee
To last through forever, another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today i know I'm living for tomorrow
Could make me past, but that I musn't fear
For I know deep in my mind, the love of me I left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes a day (always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (always)
Until the day that 8×8×8 is 4 (always)
Until the day is the day there are no more

Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (always)
Until the earth just fall, the sun ignites itself (always)
Until dear mother nature says our work is through (always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you

Always
Loved you for a life time
Did you know that true love lasts for life",As,2013

Got me fucked up out here
Without you
Yeah you can call me crazy
Fuck it I'm demented
I'm out of my head in this bed
Without you
I can't go long without you babe

I got to get myself together
Black running mascara falling down my face
The days turn into nights and nights turn into days
I sip a little something
Pull on a little something
Just to numb the pain
This loneliness has taken over me

She cut my face out of every picture up in the crib
(In the crib, in the crib, crib)
Put them in a box and sent the shit to me where I now live
Dramatic shit
But that's her way, that her way
Kinda what I liked about her
I sip that red straight up
Let that burn be a reminder of the fire that I put you through
Suffering and hell what I did to you
But your only sin was loving this damn fool

Looking in the mirror (while I'm in there with you, you babe)
I'm all in my feelings

Cause' he lost a good thing and we don't even know why

Runaway from all the pain I feel now
Now that you're gone

So I runaway and then you followed me out
Out of the dark

Just a small confession
Straight from my heart
Break

Couldn't talk
Couldn't sleep
Didn't know
What you need
Got me feeling so weak
Cause you came in too deep
Wanna stay

I remember we were drinking, laughing about the weekend
We went all the way to the top
Then we swore it to be the last time, but every single time we say that (oh)

Should I just be quiet? (Shh) He's still laying, he's snoring

That I intend to stop living
I won’t pretend
I’m good at forgiving
But I can’t hate you
Although I have tried
I, I, I

Like every other hour when I think about you
So now and then I drink about you
Trying to numb the pain with Juice and Gin
It’s like abuse, what’s the use of the bumps and bruises
If we moving towards a losing end
If I’m losing you then I refuse to win
Went from friendships with benefits
Funerals and your innocence
I can help you reminisce we in Madrid
On some double O 7 shit, we off the grid
Parting moments of pleasure, we never thought we’d ever
Suffer the consequences, the problem is
there’s a problem trying to kick this addiction
We probably can't resolve it without causing some friction
This is non-fiction, the definition of a true story
I’m like fuck pride baby that’s the kind of shit you do for me
Suicide it's a suicide, ready to die, you down to ride or what?

Sitting here wasting my time
Would be like
Waiting here for the sun to rise
It’s all too clear

Sitting here waiting for you
Would be like waiting for winter
It’s gonna be cold
There may even be snow

Marsha Ambrosius,"This for all my real niggas out there
That never got to see another day
All my niggas out there still in the struggle
And still tryna make it out
This for y'all

If I can make it through the night

Another collar, another dollar
Life's short but we live it cause we gotta
Another day, another blessing for a scholar
School of Hard Knocks, just reppin' my alma mater
That was back when I ain't have shit
God on my shoulder with the Devil on the ad-libs
Had to think some decisions through
When times hard, who the fuck you gon' listen to?
Toilet by the bunk, put you in a different mood
Locked up, Thanksgiving eatin' prison food
Back on the ropes, won't see a nigga budge
No bail for a felon so you gotta see the judge
They used to call us all lost niggas
Had the same dreams to make it 'til we lost niggas
Some was married to the game, I divorced quicker
But I can't judge, one day I'll see the lord with you

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night

Note from the marshall, you can't even borrow
And it's sad cause they comin' with the padlock tomorrow
And for you to blame the world, gotta blame yourself too
'Cause everybody feel you but nobody can help you
Bad thought get in your head, then you loop it
Stress build up then you do somethin' stupid
Put a mountain in front of you, you just try to move it
Count on one hand the couple niggas you cool with
Either they ain't pickin' up or they ain't got it
You learn the hard way when your actions are idiotic
Product of your environment, and you're the product
Home invasions, niggas is gettin' tied up
This is goin' through your head while you're in the bullpen
Backed into the spot but you should've pulled in
First nigga move and you're on him
But you're really prayin' for a ROR in the morning

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night

They say tomorrow ain't promised, most nights I ain't want it to be
Nah a nigga couldn't front it to me
Too many nights for dinner I just ate an uncomfortable sleep
Had to open up the oven for heat
I was a born loser, thoughts of a sinner
Only made it out cause I fought like a winner
Threats all my life, I'm good, was all talk though
Death around the corner, all you gotta do is walk slow
Land of the haves and have-nots
Gun tucked, better to have it than to not
Try to make it out but crabs are in the lot
That'll plot, so if you take a stab you'll get shot
Look, I'm just proof a couple niggas said a prayer for me
Wasn't fair for me, God had to bear with me
Nothin' to live for, didn't have a care with me
Suicidal, had my mama sheddin' tears for me
'Cause my son might need me
Life is hard but dyin' is easy
I thank God every day that I awake
I avoid another funeral, a homi' or a wake
I escape from niggas that lived through it
Better days ahead, we just gotta get to it

And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles
Lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault
Only type of livin' I know

See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
And they ask me how I do it
Mothafucka just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the buildin'
I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh
No, no don't mention me at all
Yeah comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game
They still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fuckin' pressure
It's so much pressure
And it's all in a day's work

Work, hard
Workin' so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work

My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster man
Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police""
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired
Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirst

Hard times
I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
Only type of livin' I know

Gonna go to work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work

Let's work
Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work
So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work
Some of my friends don't understand, shit, I got to work
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that I gotta work""
If you really wanna do it like this, shit you better get back to work

No I never sell no drugs homie but I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me but I know who got 'em

Now please don't give me a reason
Cause I know you wanna keep breathing, this evening

That I'm the motherfucking one to breed them and lead 'em

When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though I've been this way since 17
Tryna get finances poppin', man I thought that was the object
To some of my niggas lost they life and then that goes the team
My only dream was holding us down like fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black
Killing them softly, don't ever call me fortunate
You don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me homie
We ain't even talking fuck that energy, fuck up off me

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But it's hard for me to believe it

I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin' with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit you can only get on an oversea flight now
You scare of my heist now
But still I got enemies giving me energy I wanna fight now
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really no clue you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then you hang yourself
Cause I got that green and gold, with a million sold
Like 19 more, from a dollar fit
But without all the diamonds though
To you I'm just another nigga

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want

It's a war going on
Yeah, it's a war going on

God told me this movie will write itself
Spread love, be wise and let foolery fight itself

'Cause it's a war going on outside on the corner
It's a war on your TV screen every morning
Not the war with the bombs and the helicopters swarming
But the war for your soul, that's what everyone's ignoring
It's a war going on
Yeah, it's a war going on

(I was just talking to the homie the other day man)

He said I'mma pump this fuckin' caine, pump this fuckin' caine
Hug this block, tote this fuckin' Glock, all you suckas lame
This my spot, this my fuckin' spot, you know what I rep
I go deep on in my way up from a kilo on that step
Tell the death, yeah I mean the death, let that pistol talk
You say truce, me speaking no english, bitch go get some heart
Fuck the law, nigga fuck the law, they can see me too
Fuck a school, and the teacher too, they don't teach the truth
What's a pops, never had a pop, let that ratchet pop
I'm too real, gave a fiend a pill for a Magnavox
Man fuck we got, fuck we really got, but this gutter shit
All my niggas hug the strip and all my bitches love to strip
So suck a dick, I got kids, and a baby mama too
Yeah she work my fucking nerves like a baby mama do
I be stressed, I be hella stressed, smoke a bunch of weed
High for real, pop the pill and drop the Xanny in my lean
I can scream, cause you just smile like everything is fine
Hope is fun, when I grab my gun, come take dear life or mine
Suicide, yeah it's suicide, life is suicide
Fuck your right or wrong, the shit that I been on is do or die
If I do I die, if I don't I die that's suicide
Got the devil with a gun against my brain like choose a side

It's a war going on

I love the hood with my whole heart
It whole heartedly been a part of me in my own thought
Process so I digest through my own art
That I'm blessed though I digress due to slow starts
But who else could bring the hood out
And tell 'em when they let God in, it brings the good out
Learn a lesson and listen, my current composition concerns your present condition
And turn direction envision of givin' blessings and wishin' you well
Well wishing and tales fishing
Siftin' through hell's kitchen to find good
Have a God-like mind as the divine should
Define good within yourself I think the time's good
And may these lines live forever like a line should
It's a war going on and your soul fighting
So frightening within you I see thunder and both lightening
Boat striking, snow ice and hail
Your whole life unfold like, cold nights in Hell
In a mode like, you're feeling low like, like you don't like yourself
You got no sight, no insight, no foresight, that's the shit that your foes like
Run up on a nigga get 'em froze like
Put the 4-4 to his foes like
Niggas 'bout to take a pic, trying to get the pose right
Red dot, headshot, hit 'em close like
Like, like all theses niggas I've got to shoot one
Fuck one, plus I'm cocking two guns
Fuck shoe money, I'm coppin' coupes son
No y'all niggas not 'bout to do none
Guns, that's a way of life, get money not God
You got guns, we got bigger guns, go get one and I ride
If I die, they say I went hard, I go super hard
Bitch you with this shits or not? We gon' get this loot or starve?
Fuck you doing? Writin' in a pad, fuck you making songs
What you rappin', boy you know what's happ'nin', that shit take too long
Fuck you mean? Get this fucking cream, get this fucking cream
Hug this block, tote this fucking Glock, can't let these suckers scheme
Shit too real, shit too fucking real, I'm too real to dream
So when it's this cold world won't feel a thing

Lonely days are gone
All them nights to come
Waited to be yours

I'd rather rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Question
Anybody ever feel
That some people around you claim to be solid but ain't real?
In relationships, business, family, in the end it's about they bills
And everyone of them wanna cheat and steal
Time for me to have no chill
Come and get ya meals and they really will with zeal
All is needy, y'all is greedy
I'm falling freely
This gonna be scogging me, we brawling easy
Had a lawman seize me
Get the hell on stay
What ya gonna do but if it's a fail on pay
Loved ones exude hella rude when it used to be smooth
Like the face of Janelle Monae
She's got the glee stopped
I'm in a pit of animals really making me bleed lots
Fatigue I wanna leave then my knee dropped
When I breathe not cause she needs guap
So extract me from this place full of hate that'll tax me
Pass the sack 'cause I'm trying to get to happy
Exactly people are feeding they call me nasty at me

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

Listen
They don't love you no more
They discover your flow
But I'm feeling my fans trying to shudder don't slow
Leaving the clown now I'm nothing but a bozo to 'em
Give my all in my sessions
I never thought that I would fall in regression
The music business now we call it recession
We bawl and we stressing 'cause y'all is divesting
I feel it when I ought to be top of these
Where the hip hopper be and The Rock put me
At the forefront but galore won, nothing but the Pac could be hypocrisy
They forgot about the prophecy that I keep the lock and key
But they talking ""He soft"" and flee now they wanna coffin me
Y'all can be treacherous, I'm the best at this effortless
But with Tech it's been deficits
Wanna fly away like a Pegasus
I feel like the scare is near, they don't care that Tech share his tears
At this moment, at this point in time I'd rather be anywhere but here

I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

I'm sure to be
At this rate, a nigga that fades into obscurity
I can't take being treated like an amateur
This is impure to me
In closing, it's messed up when you know you one of the chosen
But you can't have a show when nobody rose and all the people go when everything's frozen

Marsha Ambrosius,"I was also gonna ask about your fear as an individual
You know, it's plenty of people, feel a sense of 
Security around you and kinda lean on you
You ever feel like a certain amount of pressure from that?
Do you ever get afraid?

Of course I do
I mean everybody gets afraid sometimes

What possibly could make you afraid?
What are you afraid of? (Afraid of, afraid of)

(I'm afraid, I'm afraid)
(Sometimes I'm even afraid to admit I'm afraid)
I'm afraid of the weight of my problems
Haters working overtime, 8 or 9 jobs worth
All these wanted ski masks niggas
Old basketball shorts under jean ass niggas needa know
I'm a product of a dead poet Ryan at his low
Equals Maya Angelou, my emphatic flow can rise the status quo
Lying on the padded floor
Addict at it's best
Eradicated from the fabricated
Afraid at the thought of releasing music 
That's indicative of where I'm at in life
Will they like? Will they hate?
The better question is if they hate it is you down to pay the price?
I'll look you right in your eyes and say you mother fuckin' right
Don't bother me with adversity, I conquered more ground than King Kong could
All I think about these days is Mom good
'Cause she diabetic
My daddy just had a cancer scare
And do he still work at the post office? The answer's yeah
I'm introverted, knowing that it's not about Oz
Bigger problems outside

There's a war going on outside
That no man is safe from
You see you can smile but that won't change the color of your skin
But I'm the sinner
Yet you kick me, punch me, say don't trust me
Shoot me down like I'm up to something
Fuck with me and say I've deceived you
But how's that legal? Am I that evil?
Why do you hate me?

I'm afraid of you going to college and not acknowledging 
I'm your father 'cause you not proud enough
But I fought hard to make sure you never see certain things I'm a product of
It's easy to confuse being a father with being a provider
But all we got is us, and I'm afraid to lose you
You the coolest kid I ever saw
She did a good job with you
Sometimes I hesitate to take credit for raising you too
'Cause all I did was discipline
I never taught you to ride a bike but we still a lot alike
And you making music now? I wonder what made you wanna give this a spin
You know what I'm about to say next, right?
I'm afraid of you drinkin'
Though I never taught you to swim, I'm afraid of you sinkin'
I know I taught you to fight, you ain't in condition to win this
You wired different
You just ain't the nigga you friends is, it's scientific
Not my opinion so you know you genetically
Predisposed to more than just eating soul food
So I'm afraid of you to try to risk it
You in a gene pool with a lot of sick fish
And I'm the sickest of them all
Alcoholics die when they stop from symptoms of withdrawal
Look out the window, tell me what you see
Police shootin' brothers the color of you and me
And they actin' like they hate us so you may just
Wanna love yourself enough to compensate it
If I can say this, say this one thing, this one thing non-related
You were never, ever, ever, better than me in basketball

Criminal, I prepared to be, in your feelings? Won't hear from me
I talk to God, the devil on the other line stressin'
Keep a weapon there, 'cause slippin' ain't how I'm gon' learn no lesson
Ain't no actors here, I told Bully, ""I wish that Stack was here""
Mugga too, my hoody blue, so much ice, they gon' have to stare
Used to hate my building smell, half for the homies still in jail
Harlem different, either kill a cell or pray to lift your bail
White rice and tuna fish, way before Ruth Chris
We was broke, I ain't care who was rich, stick up kids do exist
Hard news, just listen, the dog food was clickin'
They moved bitch, long before I heard of Ludacris
I watched it with my own eyes, dirty kitchen for home fries
Hajjis if ain't nothin' open, just make sure they toast mine
I'm thankful for them steak and cheese, I love the hood, I'd hate to leave
How the fuck was we trappin' outside when it was eight degrees?
I still have a hard time tryna understand why Ma$e would leave
Gave niggas the reason, plus the truth, I could relate to Beans
Free Meek, I'm just tryna chase a dream
They'd rather us upstate and grainy, you never had to chase a fiend
Passed them off the 'Gram, and then they ran before they paid you

Lit the crib up with candles, felt like the lights was out for weeks
I ain't had the drive, wanted to survive until I found the keys
220 on the dash and yes, we taxin', we got mouths to feed
Thank you Lord, I'm grateful Lord, if I got it, I blame you Lord

Fuck the way the system set up, every day I break the law
Spend some money, make some more, never thought I'd make it poor
Imagine we was takin' score, militant, I relate to war
Thankful for my only child
Sellin' out these shows that make my homies smile
Wake up in Miami to hear the ocean sound
Grateful I seen eighteen, grateful I seen twenty-one
Grateful that my pops ain't throw me out, he found my nigga gun
Of course I said it wasn't mine
Runnin' to the park told my father, let's talk another time
'Cause he know I want to rhyme
A .38, I kept it on me, I blow it like a runny nose
In the projects with like three bitches to diddy crib with like a hundred hoes
Stomach growlin', I don't take it for granted
I come from housin' (projects), I need some shit come with a water fountain
My daughter smilin', I'm thankful Freaky told me to rap
Thankful Jungle paid attention, the streets could never hold me back

Loyalty and love over everything (the streets could never hold me back, thankful Jungle paid attention)
Flowers over stones and the choir sings (the streets could never hold me back, thankful Freaky told me to rap)
How many of them do we know though? (thankful Jungle paid attention, the streets could never hold me back)
Lost so many loved ones and now they're gone too
Gone too soon, streets raising kings
And queens, we gotta fight to believe again
Still loyalty and love over everything
Still flowers over stones and the choir sings

Ooh, pray, thank you, I'm grateful
Grateful, ooh yeah
Thank you Lord, I'm grateful
Grateful, ooh yeah
Ooh, thank you Lord, I'm grateful, ooh
Thank you, I'm grateful
Thank you God, I'm, thank you, I'm grateful
Everything you do for me, let us bow
Thank you, I'm grateful
Ooh, thank you Lord, I'm grateful
Thank you, I'm grateful",Grateful,2018

I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would've ever thought we'd build this

Tryna walk to school get your jaw socked
Tryna pump your gas, get your car shot
Large profit margin on the long shots
Cause young niggas rarely make it off of our block
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
High school, didn't go
Couldn't understand my plan, now you niggas know
Self made, well paid
I'm from where they tell you never touch the shell case
I'm from where they teach you never trust a pale face
This top bangin' I can tell you bout a field race

Sold out shows that's a door split
Niggas ain't show up, that's a forfeit
Left my record label, just got more rich
I switched it up, that's me singin' on the chorus
But still I spit bars so gutter
Drive cars, no stutter
Top floor, no clutter
Hardwood floors though
White wall, that's where my awards go
Runnin' from the law, till they foreclose
Sit wit myself when them doors close
Sometimes I got a question, only lord knows
When I be going out in Copenhagen, spendin' euros
Night time, locs on
Do it big nigga till my Locs home

Marsha Brady,"Away in a manger,
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head

The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side,
'Til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray

Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Marsha Hunt,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

Home is where I want to be.
I've been on the road so long my friend, 
And if you came along
I know you couldn't disagree.

It's the same old story
Everywhere I go, 
I get slandered, libeled,

I hear words I never heard

And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied,

You better get your bags and flee.

Marsha Milan Londoh,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014
