Organ & Chimes,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2002
Organ X,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars,

But I don't play when it comes through
Ain't no doubt about it baby
'Cause I'm fallin' in love with you

I'll be a shelter from the storm
I'll be our blanket to keep you warm
'Cause you don't know what you mean to me
Can you imagine how I feel

I'm shining... Burning
I'm shining... Burning
Doesn't matter what your friends do
Doesn't matter what they say

They just jealous of me and you
They don't know what love can do
I'll be your shoulder you can cry on
I'll be a shopping cart you can rely on

Can you imagine how I feel

Organic Audio,"On my plane to manila 
Passengers sit row to row 
The flight staff served the curry chicken!
And then I heard the turbine go
Yeah...

Out of my window was the sunset, 
On the wing a funny glow, 
Then my seat started rattling, 
Assured that wasn't part of the show, 

So I started to dance, 
Without wearing no seat belt
So I started to dance, 
Without wearing no life vest, 
I started to dance.. 

My plane noise went down, 
I heard the pilot talk regrets, 
But the people didn't panic, 
They just all, stared at me, 

And they started to dance, 
Without wearing no seat belts, 
We all started to dance, 
Without wearing no life vest, 
We all started to dance, 

It was quiet a ride. 

So I started to dance, 
Without wearing no seat belts 
So I started to dance, 
Without wearing no life vest, 
I started to dance...",Manila,2003

Fueron tantas lágrimas de amor
Que derramo mi tonto corazón
Que ya no quiero más sufrir otra desilusión

No me arrepiento de lo que pasó
Pues golpe a golpe
Aprendí la lección
Ay que tener cuidado
A quien se entrega el corazón

Y es que nadie puede imaginarse
(Lo que yo lloré)
Lo que es cerrar los ojos
Y escuchar la soledad
Mirar la mañana al levantarse
Un deseo incontrolable de querer llorar

Y por eso
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero llorar
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero sufrir más

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero llorar
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero sufrir más

Viví la angustia y la desolación
El trago amargo que da una traición
Lo que es ser rechazado sin motivo, sin razón

No me arrepiento de lo que pasó
Pues golpe a golpe
Aprendí la lección
Que hay que tener cuidado
A quien se entrega el corazón

Y es que nadie puede imaginarse
(Lo que yo lloré)
Lo que es cerrar los ojos
Y escuchar la soledad
Mirar la mañana al levantarse
Un deseo incontrolable de querer llorar

Y por eso
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero llorar
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero sufrir más

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero llorar
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y ya no quiero sufrir más
Eh

(Lloré, lloré y lloré y ya no quiero llorar)
Oye lo que yo sufrí, lo que yo lloré
Te juro que no lo vuelvo a pasar
(Lloré, lloré y lloré y ya no quiero llorar)

Ya no quiero llanto
Ya no quiero pena
No quiero tristeza
Y es que a mí no me interesa
Nunca volver a llorar

Eh, otra vez

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Nadie puede imaginar
(Lo que yo lloré, lloré y lloré)
Lo que yo tuve que llorar

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Ay, nadie puede imaginar
(Lo que yo lloré, lloré y lloré)
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Lo que yo tuve que llorar

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Los engaños, las mentiras
La angustia y la soledad
(Lo que yo lloré, lloré y lloré)
Y hoy tome la decisión
De no volver a llorar

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Los golpes que dan la vida
me pudieron enseñar
(Lo que yo lloré, lloré y lloré)
Que a veces hay que ser fuerte
Y volver a comenzar

Eh
Y ya no lloro más
No que no
Y dice

(Llora como yo lloré)
Como un día yo sufrí
Así mismo los veré
(Llora como yo lloré, como yo lloré)
Y después pero no

(Llora como yo lloré, como yo lloré)
No me vengas a pedir
Porque esas cosas ya no creo
(Llora como yo lloré, como yo lloré)
Eh así que chau te veo

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Nadie puede imaginar
(Lo que yo lloré, lloré y lloré)
(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Lo que yo tuve que llorar

(Lloré, lloré y lloré)
Ay, nadie puede imaginar

Organized Konfusion,"[Pharoahe Monch]
By the grace of God, I give a speech like Malcolm
Expressin, flexin, flaunt the style that's wicked (UHH!)
Inflicted, addicted -- now people can't understand
the particular way that I've kicked it
Smooth (mmm) is it not?  (Yup!)
Is it dope?  (Yup!)  Is it hype?  (Mmm-hmm)  Is it hot?
Easy for you to hum along to whenever I'm rappin
Keepin your feet, tappin, and keepin your hands
comin together you may think you're nice but I am Alpha Beta
Glee and clap on the microphone, to kick a rhyme like, this one..

[Prince Poetry]
Artistical formulas, label me as a hip lyric professor
Pressin to be the one a lyrical chauvanist
Study facts my brother, read all about it
Cause Prince Poetry and Monch gets on down undoubted!

	Somethin smooth yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
	United together, through thick and thin forever
	Just for the people's pleasure
	This is something new for you
	We are.. the simply too positive MC's

[Pharoahe Monch]
Design a rhyme like an inventor
Intertwine, combine the centrifugal forces in the center
giving it a steady a flow, who's like dope (you are!)
Better yet, I'm like acid
Cooler than Lake Placid
You're loving it when I'm passing it off, slick (slick)
So that you know (so that you know)

[Prince Poetry]
Well it's me, your majesty, Prince Po, I flow
like spring water out of a faucet when I complete it
the text like toss it cause I will toss it to the Pharoahe
Capital M, lowercase O, then the N, then the see-H
Witness the presence of the two N-E-W
Intellectual through rhythm I went interjectin you
a few messages, paragraphs, stories, a few laughs
When it comes to steppin yo there ain't no quarters
or even a half like poison, I subject to feed you venom
I find em, line em up, I fold em up, and Monch will KILL EM!

[Pharoahe Monch]
Curteous!  Givin a high-five or handshake
but I can flip, like a chef at the House of Pancakes
When I speak, I create a new strange tongue
MC's clingin I bring on a new swing and they swung
off the tip I'm well equipped to stick to the cut when rhymin
The kind of MC you find, with the mind of a ?mizda?
Chronological timing or maybe Simon Bar Sinister

[Prince Poetry]
Hmmm, mm mm mmm!  Yo
Sometimes I'd rather stop acceleratin and flow
to a slowwwwwwwer tempo sit back relax bust the
introduction that you're sleepin on, I must awaken you
Now come with us cruise in, cause me and Monch
is takin you to another dimension, keepin you up to par
Look up to me as an advisor
Much wiser than the average rap star/struck you
not as another but a brother who's hype
Sim-pl-ly too positive MC's too dope too trife
to comprehend, this is finally the end
To my foes and my skeezers, the audience pleasers

	Somethin smooth yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
	United together, through thick and thin forever
	Just for the people's pleasure
	This is something new for you
	We are.. the simply too positive MC's",Audience Pleasers,1991

Here we go again with the funky intro
People approach me knowin I`m the Prince Po
e-t, are-why, and I`m the first batter
The Pharaoh usually go first, but it don`t matter
Funky slices of beats like this
Comes once in a blue, but it`s not hard for me to chew
So kick off your shoes and don`t forget your socks
I wash and wash them emcess like Clorox
Skills I have, good and plenty
If you want dope lyrics but still gimmicks gimme
Beats, equivalent to just something that I can
Flow [flow] flow [flow] FLOAT ONnnnnn
It`s gettin heavy so heavy and keep ya coat on
When I, proceed to, light the party
In the summer, somethin like a Mardi, Gras
Bikinis, panties, bras
Juicin em and I`m suckin the girls up like straws
OOPS upside ya dome
I don`t answer the phone when I`m home not alone
on the bone
Leave your name and your number and a brief message at the end of the tone
BOOP!
Oooooh, and I like it
Cause I`m Poetry the psychic
Intellectual level would rather
nah, nah I don`t like that
{talking} one more time
Rollin lyrics, off the tip of my tongue [swing]
I swing [swing], I swang [swang], I swung [swung]
Bringin you the news like Kaity Chung
But I`m not a pretty oriental specimen from
`Hong Kong Fooey, numba one supa guy`
I love the women but I don`t try to see em
I`d rather make the money bein on the cover of E.M.
Get MCs mad make em flare up nostrils
I`m Poetry the rap fanatic I get hostile

Verse Two: Pharaoh Monch][
Pressure presssure pressure pressure pressure pressure cooker
I leave the party when I mass a lot of hookers
Slip and slide, I slid the sludge
[fudge] fudge [pudge] pudge, but I never hold a grudge
Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs
[The organism`s on the jury] guess who`s the judge
I hit the hook HEAVY
Ready no chitter-chatter I figure since I`m bigger why pitter-patter
Props in no particular poetry persists to pertriculate ?
You`re just a pussy [MEOW]
Cat when I`m deckin you
Disrespectin you
Clever whenever I select a new dialogue
One plus one get it together
Girls don`t despair cause I`ll be your `Fair Weather Friend`
No I don`t have a Benz and no I don`t have an Infiniti
I figure the eight inches of ME, will be the remedy
Cause when I pull up to the bumper
Cause I`ll be down to thump a girl like Heather Hunter
I tell you now you never hated
The triple X when it comes to sex is what I`m rated
I tell you know that I can give good love
Yes I`m the one you should love
So don`t try to diss fudge pudge
`Cause it`s al-right, with, me`

Organized Konfusion,"There's just too many rages
Too many infinite screams at night, we're living in concrete cages
Another child is doomed, to be torn in his mother's womb
by the spark of the twelve gauges
Sometimes it seems like I can't go on, I can't go on
But when I envision a black man with thorns in his hand
on a crucifix I get strong
Never will I ever let a devil deceive me again (HA!) mislead me
Cause what I'ma hit you with's gonna hurt (yeah)
Because the flesh is meaningless it remains amongst the dirt
But the soul is uplifted
10-31-67 I'm God gifted
MC's are changing it grows like a fungus
Beware of the evil that walks among us, behold
a fallen angel, hark, the rebel
The mark of 6-6-6, the Devil
You better beware cause he's comin behind you
No it doesn't take long for him to find you
It's a sneak attack black, he's gonna smack you
In the form of a rock that's inside of a capsule
Or maybe in the form of a man
that says to trust me and then begins to shake your hand
But when you examined your hand you learned
you're alarmed that your palm was disfigured and burned
No no no no, it's not surprising
Open your book, look to the horizon
Start scoping, open your eyes and strive to
study the holy Qu'ran or read the holy Bible
I'm making a getaway, plan it's gonna be a better way
There's gotta be a better day

Hmmmmmmm... and now I ask, Lord have mercy upon me
and grant me sight, for what I can't see
For you are the shephard and I shall not want
to front, yes to be blunt, I won't flunk
For I am blessed with the gift of knowledge (yeah)
without college, but now let's shift
into the specific dimension that we call Earth
Where God gave us the gift of birth
Last but not least Ephessians 6 tells you to teach the child
Revelation tells about two day swarms, the guns and diseases
Homicides over epidemics and crack vials
Got guns going BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK
And when you look up you see a kid got struck
But mentally the blood pours out of the mother's heart
Cause it hurts to lose to Lucifer's part (mmm, yeah)
Yes, for I have seen the light
That shines bright even in the dark of the night
And I (I) thank (thank) thee (thee)
For constantly watching over me
There are about, four hundred and fifty-thousand homeless without housing
Brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
They can't seek a job with this hair that's dread
Sit back and face reality with these lyrics
I hope they can uplift your spirits
(we're living in the last days, we're living in the last days)
Cause God made water and trees food man woman
land fire grass animals clouds and sunrays to shine
on the parents of those twenty-six kids that died last year (last year)
And it's a shame it's a crying shame, uhh

I'm not the type that you can walk up and EFF with
Don't sleep, just peep the whole damn connnnn-cept
I'M OUT TO WRECK!!  Sucker MC's steppin to me with garbage
I'm Goldilocks and I'm, taxin your porridge (yeah!)
Ooooooh, cold but yummy
I slept in your bed, and your girl sucks funny
I'm out to bash, beats and, drop snares
Crush tables and smash up chairs, YEAH
So consider me on a rampage
I spread out and hit ya like a sawed off twelve gauge
So back up, don't play me close
Most boast to be the best, but you can't, and will never
ever in your life, come close to a mic, assassinator
I'm playin you out like Beta
I'm, watchin you, front
Flaunt your puss-head lookin just like bark
This is just a verbal whippin
for all you who don't fall, but you keep slippin
Shootin the gift for the GUH-GUH-GAB
I'm gonna dunk on your neck just like Kareem
Ab-dul, yo and ain't cool
So don't let me act like a fool
Cause I'm takin off from the tip-top of the key
with the rock passed by the Pharoahe M-O-N, see-H
the chosen lyrical soldier who backs me up
when punks verbally and, physically try to get over
with no skills, no comp..petition
havin you reminiscin about a brother
who don't give a DAMN about dissin
Black and white, clever like a superstition
Cause concepts flow, with the use of a
pen, a sheet, and when braincells meet
Brain-bustin MC's try to get hype but
smell like doo-doo cause they can't even wipe butt
Stuck-up and quite conceited
Your one hit song, all year long, at shows
everybody knows it cause you're gonna repeat, like reruns
Put your iron away, cause I got three guns
Now that we've got things up and out in the open
and clear yo, grab a chair
Cause I swing with a style that's rather ill
The illiterate can't consider it legitimate so I
kick simplistic rhymes for the plain
For the peanuts, I commence to go insane
Shredder of a competitor, makin it better for
rap listeners, cause I'm headed for
the top of the hill where Jack can't chill
Just me and Jill cause Jack has no skills
Now tell me why everybody wants to be a Prince
No skills, no sense, NONSENSE
I'm steppin up front, and to be quite,
blunt a radical creator of a poetical hypnotical mathematical
slang slurs punch, that stuns and amazes
PRINCE POETRY SHOOTS POWERFUL PHRASES
Interrupting your braincells, dilutin your thoughts
Causin side effects fully disintegratin body parts
Cause I stalk when I pray upon in the form of the flesh
Now weaken when Prince Poetry commence speakin
Side by side I rock with the Pharoahe
Watch you decomposin MC's, and look there's only a shadow
Too late, cause I'm gone, I explode
and I drop a hip-hop again, atomic, atom bomb
Releasin lyrics that you better not be usin
Organizin beats that you find Konfusin

[Pharoahe Monch]
Yeah.. here we go..
Aiyyo umm Prince (yo!) Brothers try to swing on me
nut I don't think they can hit it (nah)
These (these) styles, MC'S they, JUST CAN'T GET IT (why?)
The way I are-ti-see you-late my flows (my flows!)
Sometimes I think I know some shit
some MC's just don't know; THE
quicker I'm kickin the style
slippin and stickin the words hit quicker
better figure the verbs are thick in you
while the poetical fanatical rap acrobatical style
static never had any so I'm packin a black
automatic pistol itchy by the C.I.A.
By the way, my display of rhymes that I will lay
down on wax, distributed from a zodiac
Digitally, with a funky appeal
From the reel to reel, it doesn't matter
I still got the skill to get ill
Straight literature when you try to hit em with your
WACK STYLE, the critics are sore to crack smiles
So back up black cause you lack the skills
when I ask your girl, tax your girl
She said she wanted it from the back so I WAXED your girl
So why would you try to swing, on a nigga
with a itchy trigger finger better bring a bigger auto
hit, swing a nigga if you want to get rid of me (damn)
Your first mistake, was to consider me
a new jack black when I ahhhh-lready knew that
So get back, step back, move back, out of my way
when I roll offbeat (offbeat) again
Again and again and again and again and again
Blending the style, mending it like this
so that you can check it out when I flow awkwardly
Awkwardly I flow, yo, let's go
Most don't recollect me as T-are-O, why
cause I'ma get fly, with a microphone
dope with a microphone, you can't cope with a microphone
cause I'ma be illin, buckin off into your grill and
fillin your face with knuckles and watchin the blood spill in
down the sewer, always knew I could do a brother
with a crew of, good MC's
Or maybe even a few are stale MC's
I scatter data that'll catapault a metaphor
The epitcle epilogue editor
Trendsetter, letters are formin together
in the jaw side of my mouth, I'm alphabetic
Call me a librarian, rhymes are scary when
I mix verbs and phrases and put the vocabulary in places
where, only the M-O-N-see-H can do it
So don't ever despise
Red is the color when you look in to my Organized/eyes
you'll see Konfusion

Organized Konfusion,"[Pharoahe Monch]
I stand here before the forces of evil with a style
The poetically God-gifted child
Bringin forth the story of a lyrical soldier
Blessed to manifest in the eyes of the beholder
Words of wisdom never abuse the lines
they increase, as I release a phrase like a uzi 9
from the larynx
Shot in repitition, words never heard before
but still the rendition of rap will enable me to attack
from dawn to dusk, for liberation
Driven I will never give in to interrogation
The rank, given to me, the Pharoahe
Cause every bro flows like a crossbow
Equipped to pierce your soul with a poison-tip arrow
Any man wearing a blindfold can be misled
but wise are the ones with the eyes in the backs of the head
Here's the key to unlock the door:
Imagine a poet without poetical form
Rhymes are for sure as an attack
cause they adapt to combat for the prisoners of war

[Prince Poetry]
I drop smash and causin damage equivalent
to a hy-drogen bomb, raidin villages like
a poetical soldier in Vietnam, Poetry
releasin deadly gasses, bodies deteriorating
as they stalk past the fatal acid
As a rebel of rap, I stop, load the Luger
as I maneuver with the caution as I verbally counterattack
Striking like a mad sniper cause I'm the type of
hyperactive viper to wipe away the enemy with no remedy
cause I'm the epitome so don't try to get rid of me
You little itty-bitty twenty-five automatic, you're killin me
cause I'm a glock 9 that will rock your mind
Distortin it, shorten your brainwaves
as the rhyme intertwine with the sign of the times
Don't sleep cause I creep attackin from the side
that is blind, therefore I gotta be hard to the core
And I walk, as a prisoner of war

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wake up to the mathematics of an erratic rap
Rejuvenator of rhyme, that sort of come automatic
Poetical medical medicine for the cerebellum
I divert em and flirt em insert em then I repel em
a breakdown, poetical shakedown
Fifty-two pick-up a stick-up so get on the floor facedown
The ammo to keep the people steppin
breakin open the vault because I'm like a verbal assault weapon
I'm mathematical, acrobatical
Attack the wack take rap to the maximum
You're strung out you're hung out when you heard the style
that I brung out of faint air must come out my mouth
where I stick my tongue out in the at-mos-phere
Take a good look at what's happening here
On the microphone, I'm RAPPIN
Pickin-em-stickin-em up, breakin-em-shakin-em up, and bashin
the lyric dictator, the aviator of antonym
All beware to prepare for the guillotine
Rhymes go express, expert, extreme
Be up to par with wisdom and intellect
Detatching one's head directly from one's neck
Still I've been illing and drilling your brain
like a villain I came in the darkness to spark the literature for sure
when I rhyme for the prisoners of war

[Prince Poetry]
There is strength in my men-tal-bolism, brains to spare
upon info, knowledge, data, greater aspects
affects my future environment
So in the event I drop science to suit ya, uproot ya
Hunt ya down
Verbally attackin from the ground up to intellectually shoot ya
Lurkin through the shadows of darkness, shots fired
the spark hits the trees, releasin lyrical ammo
while I camoflouge in the flash of my stature
Mentally cease MC's, that be surrounded I capture
And enemy lines are crushed, bumrushed
And plus your government officials are corrupted
cause they're down with us; poetical rebels on a rampage
of wrecked dialects, blown lyric projects
Heat is scopin you through my infrared twenty-twenty
scope lens, steppin upon base that's when the
Organized Konfusion massacre begins with a blast
Never will an intruder approach cause they will never ever last
cause the task is total termination
Poetry and the Pharoahe starts as the revelation",Prisoners of War,1991
Organized Konfusion,"Don't forget to do that thing for your mother Roosevelt!
Yeah yeah yeah, alright, alright

[Prince Poetry]
Running upon the jagged edge, FUCK, THE ROUGH LIFE
when you have to gain much respect
As an individual keepin negativity minimum
requires havin courage respect him his intellect
so you gotta be on THAT specific type of SET
Like Roosevelt, especially when your cards are dealt
You see me, frankly, I don't give a hoot
about the blanks you shoot out of your mental bank see
I like Roosevelt, cause he ain't booty
Moody maybe, baby you're mad cause he smashed up your cutie
Playin the courts, takin the loss, to wherever
some clever college edu-ma-cated individual
With financial status JUST to mess what the BANK stated
Girls love it, and you can't look above it you hate it
Peeped his method, you laid, you waited
You never ever contemplated if I pull a automatic
will I leave the artillery out or just flight
Check in the night, you're out to snipe, my man
you can't stand upon sight of him
Out to fatally ignite him
Roosevelt felt staticky, he knew things were shady
Grady had, Bradley's uzi, but he always packed a clip or two
belongin to a nickel-plated .380
Givin off the impression of a clever nerd
Never was a suspect when a homicide occurred, in the suburbs
He was referred, to as a respectable intellectual
Highly acceptable rebel from the ghetto on the level
of an intelligent rapper, create him just like Giupetto
The aggresive type, and he's not your puppet
Stickin quickin enough to pull a skeezer with repetition
after takin aim and buckin and blowin the smoke away
then tuckin and jettin home, hopin that no stunts are stuck in it
He needs sleep, for eight o'clock class
so as fast as he crash, he might last
for six hours of bed passed, cause Roosevelt's a scholar
Ivy league material, cully-head kid with BRAINPOWER
Six foot two, and we wear the same size shoe
He drinks brew, and he runs with my crew, my herd
on a continuous basis, in the same, places
Rollin out five deep, but it's only four faces
So I don't, give a two, drip-drops about, what those have felt
And if I die (and if he die) and if I die (and if he DIEEEEEEEE)
And if I die it's because of my man Roosevelt

Ooooooooooooh I'm so confuuuuuuuuused.. DAMN, IT HURTS!
People persist to treat me like dirt
I don't sleep at night, time cause dimes I DON'T DROP
I sling and clockers cease
Commanders in Chiefs when I pop rocks
Dig deep within, you might recognize me
I'm the one with the bloodshot eyes
Hot rays of sun, beat down upon my face as if I'll melt bacon
Why the hell my mother named me Roosevelt Franklin?
I .. don't .. know, so I strive to gain
only the Lord knows my eyes have seen the pain
Tears comin down my cheeks like rain
I was abused, they stripped the mind for amusement
Now I walk the path of ORGANIZED KONFUSION
But it's only a temporary formality
Cause my man Scott turns illusion into reality
A loaf of bread (a loaf of bread), a stick of butter
Somebody's mother lies, dead in the gutter
So I move QUICK FAST, to get past quickly
Swiftly, at last, cops can't get WITH ME
Can't hit me, nah never I'm TOO NIFTY, people SHITTIN ME
Products in the projects so I pump FIFTIES
in soda cans so dogs won't SNIFF ME
I'm takin the proper precautions (yeah)
Cause once my mother told me she was gonna get an abortion
I can't keep track.. of the fluctuation.. of time
Hallucinogenics keep, abusin my mind
Gotta pick up, gotta pick up, gotta pick up, gotta pick up
more product, gotta move, gotta go I can't get stuck; not here
Not if I want to become Roosevelt Franklin the employee of the year
I wear baseball caps over my eyes so you can't make out
me at night when I'm standin on the corner eatin Chinese takeout
.. damn I almost forgot, yo yo I have to break out

	Yo don't forget your moms told you to get that stuff

Rain support roots that implants the tree
There's a breeze - in the park, kites fly high
Under the branches, con-vertibles fly by
The sky..

Paints a picture that creates a scene
of the destiny that controls my fate
Reflections of light, creates shapes

Inside of this particular sphere, I see kids in the street
When I pass, I go Beep! Beep! Beep!

[Pharoahe Monch]
See the black boy over there runnin scared
His old man runs numbers summers
Come in and he'll feel dumb if his son
doesn't have a new pair of sneakers
So he combinates people's numbers in sequence
when play straight, but not in the leaders

It's daytime but we still peep stars
Parties every night, we gotta move, we gotta go
We gotta step, let's, jet!

I bypass Howard, and detour Benson
Cause I don't really feel like fencing today
So I chill in my own dimension and listen to the sax blow..

But at the same time, it attacks you
In this particular era of darkness
Bust a rhyme that might enlighten the mind and spark this
trail to follow the light that's guiding you from
the evil that you walk into the sun
From what I see it's an addiction
I'll explain to the brain about pain affliction
Grab my hand, hold it tightly
Close your eyes and maybe you might see what I see
Yo, what I said simplistic
But what I see's not materialistic

My hayfever is actin up, so I took a couple of antihistamines
WHEW!  I got struck with relief
Now patiently, I wait for the summer
Cause the spring brings pollen and that can be a bummer
A terrific brother was havin a specific get-together by the beach
Rolling Rock's, plus Peach Schnapps, served on the rocks
The Organisms play the boardwalk, pullin numbers from Pros' Peak
The scenario, where we go pumpin the Alpine stereo
Hop along the turnpike on our way to the merry-go-
-round up the herbs at six flags; we're on a mission
Hittin the streets of New York in zig-zags
Walkin to the park, hark, the herald, named Erald
who creates with charts
Central Park swarms with intellectual dialects
With the potential, of the city's best emergency medical techs
So I dip dip dive
Listen to the musicians in the park play live
The Funky Drummer was drummin even though he was a bum
Some couldn't comprehend, the vibe that blended
With the sum, there were some, who wasn't dumb
I supported with the hum, dropped five bucks, cause he was the one

Damn it really hurts my heart to remember these (remember these)
Days way back, in the seventies (seventies)
The only AIDS you used to know was cool-AIDS
Corn-bread, corn-rows, and corn-br-AIDS
Pull up a chair, read a book like Dr. Seuss
Peel off the skin, eat all the meat
Nibble on the bone, and then suck the goo
Man if my mother was the Colonel, her chicken woulda sold
It even taste better THE NEXT DAY COLD
Chick-chicken.. chick-chick-chick-chicken
When I collect my thoughts I recollect
I used to listen to my moms (to my mommy)
""Damn it!"" everyday,
""Boy you better clean up your room before you go outside and play""

Yo Monch you can remember when we used to play skelly way back
Blastin wax, side or tops, Prince don't play that
Uh-oh, it's six o'clock, I'm late for dinner
If my girl wasn't his girl, I was definitely in her
Got in them print skirts (yo you was feenin for a chicken fix)
Ran in the kitchen and put my finger in the cornbread mix

Mom yells dinner's ready, cause she's the boss
All I needed was my ketchup, and my hot sauce
and my, cornbread, now I'm, ready to dig in
Pick the meat off the bone, and then I ate the skin

I used to rock my British Walkers to church
After the choir sang the preacher started to preach
so I had to search
for a pen and some paper to keep myself occupied
But the aroma from the kitchen came and sat by my side
and said, ""MmmmmMMM! You know I smell good""
I said to myself, ""Please oh please reverend now would
you speed up the sermon so I can determine
whether I'ma have peas or collars greens
with my chicken that I'm yearnin""
Turnin to the usher in the back, whispering,
""Please keep the chicken monster from coming through
the crack of the door!""  Later at the table
moms poppped my hand until it was sore
Cause I ate the chicken, before
the preacher said grace, but I'm ready to go for self
But there's not one piece of chicken on the table left

Nightfall, I stuff the rook, then I'm looking for
the original book which contains the words of God
Six hours until dawn, my quest to capture the queen
without being seen by the pawns
Call me Bishop, bishop takes rook, rook takes pawn
pawn takes knight, knight takes queen
Queen takes the original King James virgin (check)

Get you sit you down, let you know I never get dropped

Even inside of the grooves of a record, check it
Check it again, check it again, check it again
Check the metaphors, make sure they're making sense and then
Gimme one-hundred percent credit

But when it comes to business, nigga don't play
I look beyond all this stress to seek faith
Mad homicides, unemployment rates sky high
Shorty busting caps, cops caught him out there
Daytime drama and his mama didn't care
That's why I shouldn't be rapping and packing pistols on the bully
But niggas be stressing me and I ain't paid in fully
So I'm dropping something fatter, not for props
We're respecting the matter, hops
I'm fat, check my stats, Prince drops data for me and my man Pops

Why are they watching me buy my juice?
Why must they clock me buy my juice?
Just give me my change and please put my change into my hand

No remorse for the course I take when you pull it

Niggas who knew hit the ground runnin and stay down
Except for the kids who played on the playground
Cause for some little girl she'll never see
More than six years of life, trif-le-ing
When she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards
A red, Range, Rover, then I ricochet
Fast past a brother's ass, oh damn, what that nigga say
""Aww fuck it"", next target's Margaret's face
And I struck it
Now it's a flood of blood in circumfrence to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street

Bashin through flesh I'm wild
Crashin through the doors of projects hallways

Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it

Great balls of fire, I'm travelling at higher speeds
To proceed to penetrate flesh, hitting the splint
After splitting the chest of a Queens fiend
Age of pagers shredded to pieces from the Glock 9
And it's hollow tips, it releases the polices
In back of the ambulance
Blood loss as I shift across your chest
Arrest, rupture, I mess up ya, slasher
Shall I bust ya liver, faster, blood pours

Thank me for spraying the operating room
The body still consumes me, doc had to remove me
Mmm lord, why do they use me?
I'm takin individual for keeps Hobbes
So peep the cops, in the ghetto bustin shots for props
And when I hit, shit *bang bang bang bang*

Cops tried to explain to his pops what I done
I flip up the hollow tipper and I'm not the one
And as a human I'm the surprising one

You never, ever know how I'm coming
Metamorphasizing, rising in turbulence
Condensed into a bullet, pull it, now I'm making moves
With no sympathizing, uhh, so take a hit nigga, sprint
Onto the scenario, I'm at a party with O
A lot of honies parlay and the DJ's playin the Fudge Pudge flow
Five niggas come up in the club for a rub

Five, the tip, getting my jollies from the screams of the ripped
In your chest, then I flip

Bruises fake shoes is your renaissance

The greatest thing in this world is life 
And life is full of pain struggle and strife 
Decisions and moves you make gotta be precise 
Step careful son watch how you roll your dice 

The greatest thing in this world is life 
And life is full of pain struggle and strife 
Decisions and moves you make gotta be precise 
Thinkin' that you the man and you might see ice 
And that ain't nice

Pharoahe Monch 
Never exceeding my recommended dosage 
When it comes to licking, selecting, chicken 
It's never what it seems when you're picking 
Cause you can't tell from the eyes 
Especially now they separate the legs from the wings and thighs 
Ain't no surprise in it 
You get it, with, cellophane wrapped tight over the meat 
They be like disguising it 
I'm sort of sticking to my old ways (true) 
Keeping my order score the chicken dark nowadays 
Even believing in retrieving in my own chicks 
It's, no need to be rude (shit) 
I let the butcher chop it up and key food 
And hit her with the keys if she's On Bended Knee like Boyz II Men 
I tell her I don't want to catch some vanilla poisoning 
I'm poised and when it's the opportune time 
Before I stuff my face 
Kneel my head over my plate, then I say my grace 
Pray up above 
Slip on my rubber glove and dine 
Polish off the meal and enjoy some wine 
Relax recline 
Yeah

Aiyyo most def, you know I love, gettin' it on 
(but not without the stretch) 
Don't need to be making that three letter catch (cool) 
Careful who I choose to make ooohs 
Better believe me love (we living in the paradise of fools) 

Yo Pharoahe (right?) Remember I met Yvette in Dallas, Tex 
(That cool queen long blonde chick with mad connects? No quest) 
Oh yes, she hooked hooked us to the game 'cause strange shit 
Was going down in town 
There was a pretty dear packin' pound cakes 
A cocoa butter babe with papes jewels a black Ac 
And mad niggaz was liking that 
Players tricking on that chicken and slippin 
And never to go far; cause Shante had the scar 
Now everybody knew why motherfuckers started droppin 
But nobody knew Shante's ex-husband, was needle poppin 
And on the other side of town, medical records was lost 
Blood samples was crossed and doctor's mix-ups was found 
Yvette said, ""The six o'clock news covered the scam"" 
Three families blew the fuze 
It was a psycho doctor at hand and insanity rules 
Only two to lay five on that man, and he's singin the blues 
He sings the blues, he sings the blues 

We're living in the world of frustration plus 
The lies lust gluttony and mistrust 
Situations we discuss about world domination reflect
Guns money greed and sex it all connects like a puzzle 
In the game of life, in the game, in the game of life 
In the game, in the game of life 

The greatest thing in this world is life 
And life is full of pain struggle and strife 
Decisions 

The greatest thing in this world is life 
And life is full of pain struggle and strife

Design a rhyme, like a plan for the government
Six Million like Steve Austin, costin
Apprehended if I am
In times and my body will erupt *explosion*

Bust it through a crowd, a bitch nigga sing soprano

All MC's lets make one thing clear
You're all the same, I will remain, fuck the fame
Feelin the lane to shoot, I declare War Games

For niggas who flaunt figgas for more fame

With fire proof camouflage and power

This here rap will slap you and your team, and that bad bitch
Sleaves from my uncut, raw like cope
Preme dig up boys, roll up and smoke
Then toge it, back to B.I.
See I can do this, I'm professional
Too much weight to weigh any style
Dutch Master superior blend, inhale me right
Young Phillies take a toke of my rap, and get the
Willies para-
Noid, niggas all non void
Fuck with O.C., get your life destroyed
Like a marine, I'm a trained rap killing machine
Fiend to rock a mic, set from New York to New Orleans
Over seas I conquer, rough like blanca
Love to eat actors, gotta take for drama

Organized Konfusion,"When you deal with the other side, you see things
They warn you, they let you know, about your friends around you
People around your circumstances
One must have belief in order to believe
One must see in order to know
These little things I tell you is what's kept me here
Is what's made it, possible, for me to tell you this story

Chuck Cheese! Everybody neighborhood's fuck-up
A wild shorty, touched, heads got stuck up
Under the trestle wrestle with your chains 'til your neck muscle
Veins pop out, GIMME, paper cut your bled vessels
So what you real?  He'll test, no question
Always on the ave in plex mode, impressin'
Baby girl with jewels and his pretty boy complexion
He was makin' them lose their minds, packin' two-two's
Ready for testin' plus prime time
Stickin' your A-T-M, expert, vickin' your two-week's work
Jerk settle for lickin' ya if any funny moves is made
Known through the PJ's for puttin' bodies in graves
All over the tri-state, now why wait, when crime pays
That's what he started sayin' from way back in the days
He had plans, to stick up the bully, and his mans
But got caught up with the heat
When Jake rolled up in two fifty passenger vans

(Aiyyo! Aiyyo! Get up off me man.
 Get up off me. I didn't do nuttin man!
 Yo, yo, whassup yo? What's the problem?
 What's the problem?)

Thugs bustin' slugs, shorty's down for his respect

Anyway after puttin in three or three-to-five
You thought Chuck would be happy just to be alive
Now thoughts of cash connections
Occupied his mind first, a nigga didn't waste time gettin' work
When he seen the scheme gettin' less green
Chuck Cheese got grimy, him and about fourteen
Was countin' paper on the line at Green Acres
And behind them was the shiny link, it's victim, a move-faker
And so they caught him on the way to the car
In the parkin' lot a shot was heard from afar (whassup now sup now?)
Money's grazed, shameless, without all of the frontin'
Chuck, you know the one with the new link he's now manhuntin'
For more, who get ten G's a wop, on the low
From two hot shot spots in Hollis bold G's that stole
Pushin' weight, through the Metro, he's contracted
Twenty's a hit on his head, jealousy didn't like the way that he acted
Now Chuck heard the news and got attracted
Ready to bring racket to the wrong full metal jacket
Bold, he got some love on the street, he knows about it
Now a tactic or patient retaliation is routed
He gets outted!

(Yo f'real, this little skillet-head nigga.
Runnin' around disrespectin', you know how we get down on South side.
Word to strength, he gots to go. I don't care how it happens!)

Yo, the word got back, to my highest of rank
This cat's burnin' my ears son, his suicidal tendencies
Got me askin' about him, the word on the street is
Y'all ALL want to out him, all present and accounted
There ain't no way around this dilemma, he's stoppin' cheddar
Seen the better part of life so yo he keeps a Beretta
But all we gotta do is, follow plan A through
To the letter, y'all choose the in and outs on you

And just two days later Gator and Chuck was creepin' up Sufton
Out of the dark called yo Chuck they advanced and started buckin'
(What the fuck?) He screamed with no time for duckin', six struck
Rules even apply in these mean streets nigga with no discussion

Yo move back, y'all rap niggaz take this shit too far
I'm like an ox, brother my box-cutter leavin a scar
All my peoples are connected
That shit y'all spit on records is infected and dead
You'll get injected with lead
Ain't no need for me to sweat no man, my crew makes stacks
You just be black and ass nigga plus your records is whack
You'll get fucked up (I'll get fucked up?  Nah I don't think so money..)

I square him up while Chuck tries to trip him, fuck he's too fast
Over the top, duck, champagne and the glass struck
Now Moet's all over the floor and I'm slidin through it

From fraudulent foes, with points to prove, and no holds barred

I'm peepin out how their security maneuvered and selected
in multiples of 3 random niggaz end the beef to be ejected
Collected my thoughts, connected with members of medicine men
Who explained to me that DT's got the block locked seized
They wouldn't let us in
Sighed, slide to the midstream, plus swallow your pride
(This is the second time swine, one-time, had to spoil it)
Pull the lids on the commode and drop the glocks inside the toilet
If we, move swiftly, we just might make it
If the opportunity arise to bounce, let's take it

Recognize me nigga, look into my eyes
See raw visualizations of hate reincarnated
In it's most unadulturated form I breeth evil incarnate
Only for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds 
Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievous weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious
Yea
Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simeons to be freed that's locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
not in a manner for you to prosper
You are Ab-so-lete unless
You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
known to mankind HATE!
Awww, you are sadly mistaken if you think my Aryan race
can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes
conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes
My Spikes, bald headed white laces
Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war

My chain and thoughts is on the rag
Aryan ways learned from my grand-dad
I'm on my toes around these monkeys and spics
I thank God that I'm white, pure and don't mix
We need to snatch up these niggas and fags, reissue slave tags
Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition
Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot
I'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook
Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival
Hate!
Making them Indian pay for survival
Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation
It's exerted in the good book of Revelations
Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood
Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out

Now she smoke crack, sit back, and listen to talk shows
I hope she don`t eat pork fried rice tonight

See, the cholesterol already got my arteries tight
I might select even before she injects her lethal chemicals
To wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
Shit, I`m pissin` in the abdomen

Two and a half weeks old, already thoughts of stabbin` men
Unravelin` plots and plans for thievin` and shit
Immune to the gospel, not believin` in shit
Where the fuck do I go from here?

'Cause when the afterbirth disperse it`s hard to persevere
I swear I can`t fuck with it
She hits about two packs of cigarettes a day and I`m stuck with it

Who share needles outside in the rain on Kraftmatics
And laugh at it

Than to be scorned in this world of hate
Where life escape me and stick me like thorn

Fear it but very coherent that there`s a fifty percent chance that I might
Not make it in spite of the fact, it`s my life
And can`t take it, knowin` that I`m losin` this fight to contradiction

The love with the hatred inviting friction
Umbilically inflicted, watchin` my life go down like Christion
Understand mommy dearest is confused right now
But my faith brings us through someway, somehow

From now I vow to invest the livin`, bow only to God
The coke`s tokes and tell-lie-vision violence already got me scarred
Disregard what the devil allowed on my set
This city`s number one threat, huh

Bet I could probably run for mayor on some shit like that one day
Or get my hustle on, just like my dad, quiet as kept for the long stay

Desire presented for ice cream, Big Wheels, local rented movies
From Power Rangers, Lion King, Toy Story and Goonies

But the bomb, at least that`s what I heard
Beyond my 9 to 5`s I write a dope rap song
But with your insides gone the vision is frail
Dreams can`t set sail

From all that unprotected sex and cold Ballantyne ales
Oh well, I still prevail, God always has something in store for me outside this hell, move on 
Torn in the eyes of Allah, scorned when the dawn distortion upon
My abortion clinic visit in the morn

That's trifle, so my impact's a twenty gauge rifle
Fifty/fifty eight and thirteen inches of weapon
7-1-8 to 2-1-3 on the 747
Three strikes, two tokes, once again for the mass
Furious like the Five with Grandmaster Flash

Yo, Funky Four +1, you know makes Five
Fantastic, romantic, got live
Furious was cheeriest, the Treacherous Three
We be the Awesome Two most definitely",Numbers,1997
Organized Konfusion,"My mom is in the bedroom, cryin' again
Sister's on the street corner, lyin' again
Just heard about another one of my niggas dyin' again
I'm tryin' again to make moves
I'll be damned if we go hungry
Ever since my pops passed the responsibilities belonged to me
This song you see is like an ode to God
That he blessed my last breath to be Allahuakbar
And this city is hard, tenement buildings are barred
Incarcerated and scarred, no sentiment for when it becomes 
Time for war I'm tryin' to score like Bernard King
My vocal box sling verbal cocaine like the government
I told you I'd hurt the music
Travellin' back, bustin' shots at before Christ was persecuted
Mathematically we live at right angles
Fuck the star spangled, the makers of fallen angels
Danglin' from moon crescents, I persevere, breathe the air
Inhale the effervesence of life
This street game is stiflin' I'm triflin' upholdin' a rifle
Peerin' from behind the eyes of God, we at odds with ourselves
What is it worth when this barren metropolis prevail
Scale the walls of hell trail of a octopus

I seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet, brainwash of the people
Niggas'll never learn (shit) we just concern about
Who's fuckin' who, when time is of significance
Ghost, we disregard the most magnificent
Eat of the fruit that is poisonous and lethal
Stuck in the crux of the spell with the evil
Credits about to roll and hell is the sequel

Incarcerated scarfaces in all places
Crack sales rise, failed lives, cops and robber car chases
Y2K fuck up, you're left faceless
Hustlers bury money in Garcia Vega cigar cases
Give the drummer some, pianos, guitar basses
Trumpet in tune, Pharoahe and Prince legitimate reasons
To why they thumpin', hi I'm the most endangered species
By all means, survival is what I teach these
First time offenders catchin' seven to fifteen
Now my vision of life, is hell and heaven on split screen
Bust your shit like Mitch Greene (snitch) I switch scenes
Bring drama to that ass, that's how we on it in Queens
What? Stray bullets continue shatterin' dreams, batterin' spleens
I'm gatherin' schemes, had only cream just as bad as a fiend
Take food from a table and get drunk to your death
Now feel it in your heart from the love in my breath

I seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet, brainwash of the people
Niggas'll never learn (shit) we just concern about
Who's fuckin' who, when time is of significance
Ghost, we disregard the most magnificent
Eat of the fruit that is poisonous and lethal
Stuck in the crux of the spell with the evil

My vendetta in this form of musical song
Is to enlighten and brighten the mind through instrument and rhyme
And fix those inadequate flows that don't adapt
Makin' snacks on wax plates for DJs to scratch

Fast slash, cross hatch slash, cross patch
Every word of mine will be verbally so tight to match
That or that I hit you harder than Caterpillar trucks
In the lab where we collaborate or matter will erupt

From a, music martyr, bust mortar, break the order
Torch your sound texture, fire water's in my aura
Your future forefather, your new wave slave wrapped in chains and amulets
And hard to earn assets

Yo, niggas game playin' but not name sayin'
My aim's sprayin', I get mine that's why you stay waitin'
And vacatin', whether you know it or not, I'ma blow up the spot
If you owe me a lot, I'ma show up with Glocks

And you're still wet, pull up your socks, suspend the art
Sizzle like woks, underground spots, from the city to the boondocks
Bounce, double wishbone suspension like shocks
Multiple plans and plots, word

[Chorus:]
You know we shine with rhymes all the time
Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
Test these MCs
You know we shine with rhymes all the time
Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
Test these MCs (Word what ugh)
Test these MCs

I spit fire satire, indeed bleed, phenomenal demographics
Broadcast my rhyme forecast to eager addicts
Pave a path many can't outlast
Who these cats who blast gats rehearsin' lines for a movie cast?
But as a central, blaze the track engage
Instamatic sporadic insight pays for days
With their sickening floss, flip on tracks like Dominique Dawes
Pause, date back, flows is gettin' flashback

My existence, spirits in animated film
Three-dimensionally roller scoped
With cloakin' devices, skates, stogies and a motor boat
I hold the Pope for ransom, it's
The handsomest, assassinatin' Satan 
Leavin' the world Marilyn Manson-less
I'm in the streets like Sesame
The recipe - to kill, attain da mil/DeMille like Cecille B.
The rest'll be the aftermath, the most got statistics
Pharoahe Monch, Steve Post about to lift it


I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours
Yo yo uhh what

I'm leavin' your staff mated, makin' these crabs hate it
I lotta fags rate it and thought I got stagnated
I'm not some rap nigga that you're dyin to meet
Just another hungry brother real hungry and tryin' to eat
And in the streets you better rely on your feet
Babies is feelin' iron, cryin' to sleep
Plus the government is supplying the heat
They goin' psychotic in prison 'cause of the economic additions
Plus sex and drugs in the bleachers

3-4 come up, run up in beefcake gun butt-ups
Crush truck chains, the wiry gold frames
Chains sums up, the dollars, white collar, blue Range
Eat my dust up, ten in the bucket in the left lane gainin' momentum
Cum sendin' comers, fair game, a lot of sumtin' sumtin'
All in or nothin', silence the sufferin'
Can't stand the strugglin', some resume games to stain jugglin'
I muscled in and scribbled my name

Belittle your brain, the true grain riddle your frame
Got you forfeitin' the bitch by the middle of the game
Hostile, impossible to stop below the free
Buck em down, shook em nothin' at the top of the key
Prince, I'm nippatant, magnificent moves, strategic
Smash joints, leavin' the track paraplegic
Repeat it for those who need it, niggas catch the vibe
Fish 'n grits, hot sauce, forever embedded inside

Organized Noize,"[Verse 1]
I never got a yo when my pockets were low
But now I'm makin' dough it's all hello, hello
Since I got to dunkin' these motherfuckers I be duckin'
Callin' me on my beeper they ain't really dumb or nothin'
All up on my jock lookin' for nuts for the lickin'
Havin' such an ass, the nearest one I'm kissin'
All up on my diznick and all up in my business
So drop ya panties before ya want to give me kisses
I keep em' yes I keep em' reminiscin'
Thinkin' about my thoughts and I get with em'
Just because I'm makin' money my neighbors never blink
So happy birthday mom, ya gift is not a clock but a mink
Father was a trip, always steady trippin'
Basically cause my eyes were always red from smokin' up on spliffin'
Said I want to out the jack, can bum up in his plumbers house
But he sung a different tune when he heard about my bank account
I guess I'll be OK, I'm really not the guilty
The null is not to follow which they is filthy
Been tokin' marijuana smokin forty ounce
I never was a hoodlum but I must admit I knew em'
Forget where I came from, I know I'm always stankin'
And removin' the junkie hookers
That was givin' me up to Spinky on the lifeline

[Verse 2]
Talkin' about back in the days of my grade school years
I used to be a wild child smokin' blunts drinkin' beers
Up against, on the ends it's sticky gum on the seats
Shootin' spitballs and cause crazy fights every week
I was the complete rascal, Dennis the Menace
I there was any trouble goin' down best believe I was in it
suspension and detention became the normal activity
Teachers callin' mom cause they couldn't deal with me
And my behavior, even the next door neighbor gave up
Advice, on how to chastise me right
Sayin' whoop his ass, give him a beat and a whiplash
And that'll put an end to ya problem Mrs. Gash
Mom took heed and on the body got frame
But did it help, nope just caused more brain damage
Course the same way, the next day I was at it again
From terrorizin' the halls to cuttin' classes with my man
But my educational span was spectacular
I'm just a jerk to do my cause most Polly want to cracker
And I ain't a actor like the one with true identity
So wait, that's cool cause it wasn't for me
See I knew I could never be like Doogie Howser
So after eleventh grade I was outtie five thousand
On my lifeline

[Verse 3]
When I got mid-teenage, I started the rage with rough ones
Known as the Run-Out Crew and go snatchin' thugs
Pullin' plugs on suckers and it's on every corner
My grandma tried to school me said son your a goner
But I don't listen I was like stop breakin' my balls
Threw up my hands and gave 50 Grand a call
I told him to put me down cause the sacks pay a lot
Now I'm throwin' rocks, dodgin' cops and goin' out like pops
Daddy cool cause he went to school for an education
He found the nation but he still found his self facin'
Time in the ghetto and communities
And that pledge allegiance to the falg shit ain't foolin' me
He heard my story he put me down like folks
And they was on they way to Arizona loc
He droppin' the keys, makin' these G's, that's what I need
But someone else could drop off threes, I got freeze

[Verse 4]
Lifeless cat can he help us with each other
He's my partner, he's my cop, he's my buddy
I'm the mack oh yes a frame, yes a frame oh yes I am
What a brother gotta do to make em' chill
Damn, at the club smokin' pot, chillin' in the parking lot
Drinkin' forties talkin' shit and what not
There was a guy and a girl K-S-L called em'
Said they tried to start beef send to the butchers
Didn't know that he had guns, we heard buckshots and bullets
My eyes had to lie as we jumped through the bushes
Had to say thanks, thank God we got away
Saw the fool by himself the very next day
Now should K-S-L leave em' alone or should I let my lips whistle
He's a stupid motherfucker with a pistol
As for the dude he wasn't scared
Until I held a pistol to his head
He started to cry, K-S-L put it down do not lie
Go on my lifeline

Origin,"We have returned to the edge of our lives
To gaze deeply within the meaning to just why we're here
Look deep inside all your miserable minds
Only then you will find the meaning to why you are here
There is no truth though you try to rebuke
What you're told, what you learn every day
Face it, you're fucked, you don't know when to stop
But your stop, it awaits the point in time that you step off

You are standing on the edge of all eternity
You can't see the black abyss and you can feel no peace
Plague at your door
Death and pure war
A world unkind
Is what you find

Transfixed by the torture
You can't turn back
On the edge of darkness
You're trapped, you're gagged, you're silent
Staring at the illness
That fills your world
Balance of existence
Offset, severed, it's no more
Everything is turned upside down
An abyss where nothing is found
Overcome, your shocked in terror
It's not real, it's just a vision

Plague at your door
Death and pure war
Blindly staring
In the abyss

Take one step and you fall
Forever
Never to return no
Slipping into the darkness
Fill your void with nothing
Life deranged
Through your mind you're falling
Staring into the abyss

Just forget that you're sick
Just forget that you're dead
Your world has left you now you can't find your way
You're plunging faster
Forgotten eternity
Of hate and regressions

Finally you've hit the ground
Finally you obtain what you never found
Peering up the black slopes
Covered in flesh and blood
Human rage, souls deranged
Wanting out of this hell there's no way out

Look up to see the light
Up to see the might
You fell into night
Fall on the brink of death
Fall down with the rest
Force you to confess
Stand up to face the truth
Lost within your youth
Nothing to refute
Run dive into your grave
And your whole world has caved
Into what you made

Just forget that you're dead
Just forget where you're lead
Your world has left you now you become my prey
Your my possession
Forgotten eternities
Of hate and regression
Finally you hit the ground
Finally I obtain what you never found
Clawing up the thorned slopes
Covered with flesh and blood
Human rage, souls obtained
Wanting out of this hell screaming skywards",Staring from the Abyss,2005

Not one to be forgot 
Spoiled rotten, so they say 
Once burned, forever marked 
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Tanto que no hay tiempo ni para reflexionar
Llego tan cansado que me acuesto y ya

Pero el miércoles es media semana
Ya empiezo a sentir escalofríos en mi espalda
Y ganas de llamarte para saber de ti
Después de todo y ya sé que no vas a contestar
Y es que ahí viene otra vez otro fin de semana de soledad
Rodeado de amigos repleto de copas pero tú no estás
Desde el jueves me empiezo a preocupar
A donde es que iré para no encontrarte
Que diablos haré para no extrañar

Otro fin de semana de soledad
Viernes y sábado siempre tomando para no pensar
Y el domingo es el peor día de todos
Aunque esté con alguien sin ti me siento, completamente solo

Tal vez por eso mi vida se ha vuelto solamente trabajar

Que mujer, que hermosa esta
De cerca ame tu cintura
Y me engañaba tu labial

Me fui interesando en tu poca
Experiencia y tu forma de pensar
Y se me partió el corazón
Cuando me confesaste tu edad

Pero cuando probé de tus labios
Pero cuando abrazaste mi piel
Comprendí que es verdad que la edad es mental
Y no esta en ningún papel

Y si yo tan solo tuviera unos años menos
Y tu al menos dos o tres años más
Podría gritarle nuestro amor a todo el mundo
Pero vida tu ya sabes bien como es la sociedad
Que se la pasan pensando mal y solo hablan por hablar

Y si yo tan solo tuviera unos años menos
Y tu al menos dos o tres años más
Yo ya sería el hombre más feliz del mundo
Y tu al fin serías toda una mujer mayor de edad
Pero sigamos en secreto, pues cada día falta menos
Y yo te sabre esperar

Me dije a mi mismo, vete con cuidado no la vayas a lastimar
Hay que ser cociente de lo que nos dicen la ley y tus papas
Sin decirte nada pensé en alejarme, como posibilidad
Y hacerme el maduro, pero entre más pienso, menos te quiero dejar

Porque cuando probé de tus labios
Porque cuando abrazaste mi piel
Comprendí que es verdad que la edad es mental
Y no esta en ningún papel

It's true, I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true, you're with this yuppie scum?

Not now
Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?
Yeah
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people's
Who said I was talking to you?
We used to have this fight each night (calm down)

From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby

Mimi still loves you
Are you really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time

And you're running out the door

For someone who longs for a community of his own

I found myself in a desert
Called Cyberland

It was hot
My canteen had sprung a leak
And I was thirsty

Out of the abyss
Walked a cow, Elsie
I asked if she had
Anything to drink

She said, ""I'm forbidden
To produce milk
In Cyberland, we only drink
Diet Coke""

She said, ""Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon""
""They've closed everything
Real down""

""Like barns and troughs
And performance spaces
And replaced it all with lies
And rules and virtual life
But there is a way out""

Leap of fate, leap of fate
Leap of fate, leap of fate

""Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon
I gotta get out of here
It's like I'm being tied to the hood""

""Of a yellow rental truck
Being packed in
With fertilizer and fuel oil""

""Pushed over a cliff by
A suicidal Mickey Mouse
I've got to, got to, got to find a way""

""To jump over the moon
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon""

Then a little bulldog entered
His name we have learned
Was Benny

And although he once had principles
He abandoned them
To live as a lap dog
To a wealthy daughter
Of the Revolution

""That's bull,"" he said
""Ever since the cat
Took up the fiddle
That cow's been jumpy""

""The dish and spoon
Were evicted from the table and eloped
She's had trouble with that milk
And the moon ever since
Maybe it's a female thing""

""'Cause who'd want to leave
Cyberland anyway?
Walls ain't so bad
The dish and the spoon for instance""

""They were down on their luck
Knocked on my doghouse door""
I said, ""Not in my backyard, utensils
Go back to China""

""The only way out is up""
Elsie whispered to me
""A leap of faith""
""Still thirsty?""

Parched, ""Have some milk""
I lowered myself beneath her
And held my mouth
To her swollen udder

And sucked the sweetest milk
I'd ever tasted
""Climb on board"", she said

And as a harvest moon
Rose over Cyberland
We reared back

We sprang into a gallop
Leaping out of orbit

Women folding clothes, playing with my friends in the summer rain

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Original Caste,"One tin soldier
Listen people to a story 
That was written long ago,
'bout a kingdom on a mountain
And the valley folks below.
On the mountain was a treasure
Hidden deep beneath a stone,
And the valley people swore 
They'd have it for their very own.

Go ahead and hate your neighbor, 
Go ahead and cheat a friend.
Do it in the name of heaven, 
You can justify it in the end.
There won't be any trumpets blowing, 
Come the judgment day,
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away.

So the people of the valley 
Sent a message up the hill,
Asking for the buried treasure 
Tons of gold for which they'd kill.
Came the answer from the kingdom, 
With our brothers we will share,
All the riches of the mountain, 
All the treasure buried there.

Now the valley cried with anger, 
Mount your horses, draw your swords
And they killed the mountain people, 
So they won their just rewards
Now they stood before the treasure 
On the mountain dark and red
Turned the stone and looked beneath it
Peace on earth, was all it said.

Go ahead and hate your neighbor, 
Go ahead and cheat and friend,
Do it in the name of heaven, 
You can justify it in the end.

Come the judgment day,
On the bloody morning after

Original Caste,"The beast will make off with your children
He'll come after them in the night
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall
I say we kill the beast!

We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action boys
It's time to fol-low-me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
'Till he's dead, good and dead kill the beast

No, I won't let you do this

If you're not with us, you're against
Bring the old man

Get your hands off me

We can't have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out

We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me

Get your torch, mount you horse

Through your courage to the stinking place

We're counting on your stud to lead the way
Through a mist to the wood, where we see a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast, just as tall as a mountain,
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased
Steady fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow
Let's get on and here we go

We'll lay siege to the castle, and bring back his head

We have to warn the beast this is all my fault
OH papa what are we going to do

Now, now
We'll think of something

We don't like what we don't
Understand and in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save children and and your wives
So save our village and our lives
Lets kill the beast

I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all

Could it be
Is it she
Scara bleu! Invaders
Encroachers
And they 'ave the mirror
Warn the master If it's a fight they want
We'll be ready for them Who's with me! Arrgh

Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The beast is mine

Find a place, stand aside, we go marching into battle
Unafraid of all the things you just decreed

Raise the ram, sing this song
Here we come at fifty strong
If fifty Frenchmen can be wrong
Let's kill the beast

Pardon me, Master
Leave me in peace
But sir! The castle is under attack

Kill the Beast
Kill the Beast

This isn't working
Oh Lumiere, we must do something
Wait, I know

What shall we do, Master
It doesn't matter now
Just let them come

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Nowhere to go, no one to turn to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face to say hello to
And now the night is near
and now I can make-believe he's here

Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own, pretending he's beside me
All alone, I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes and he has found me

In the rain, the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
in the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me, forever and forever

And I know, it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself, and not to him
And although, I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him, but when the night is over
He is gone, the river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him, but every day I'm learning
All my life, I've only been pretending
Without me, his world will go on turning

Ya' decide to smile

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look
Slap on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

Can ya huh? Can you make it sound swift?

From my feet to my hips then propelling from my lips

Without a loud yell or a thunderous roar

Among with much clout now I'm living well
Never living poor even doe see doe

When the wind blows not down with H.I.V.
So I say hell no universal lingo drop dead

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns was black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

Across these endless skies.""

Its a shame strang got more aim than an archer
M.p. rock please prepare my ship for departure
Beat these young boys ass and make em run and get they fathers
Niggas get dropped from the hip-hop culture
Its the ultra mcfly like a vulture
1, 2 I come thru on the humble
Beast from the east call me king of the jungle
Beast from the east beast from the east...beast from the east

Strang cummin like a hurricane lickin shots
When I roar like a grizzly they say damn he gets busy

I be grand like puba but I most move wit dru ha
Puts the b in boo-ya, strang coming to do ya
Scream hallelujah, but it still won't help ya
Run from ogc and get caught by heltah skeltah
Jack to the other side, run for cover hide
And you still wouldn't be safe even if I let em slide
This ain't baseball, I waste yall, ask no question
Attack from the back from the black smif n wessun
I be rubbishin, any crew that claims they be bubbling
Get that ass capped
Like them niggas when they be handlin my publishing
I be lovin when fake rappers
Question my status when my crew be the phattest
Add this, you can ask my man the big kahuna
Kablow make you say yaow like junior
You been warned
The storms in the atmosphere
Move over make room gunn clappers here
Cause it's ill how I kick lyrical skill with the force
No joke when I leave you choking off the exhaust
Of course, who else could it be but mr.strang
Who'll hit that ass from every angle
They don't really wanna tangle

Strang cummin like a hurricane lickin shots
When I roar like a grizzly they say damn he gets busy

First of all strang comes first and foremost
My first instinct would be to burn y'all wack raps like toast
Fuck the first day of school, I'm on 1st ave
At the first national bank so I could fly first class
And I be the first in line
Crack that ass before I even get to kick my first rhyme
I'm in the hall like aaron puffing l's all day
First command mister keep the fat broads away
Fresh fly, ogc be the best by
Puff lai with my nigga tek out of bed-stuy
Then I, come through wit the wickedness
Who be kicking this
Strang I light shit up like christmas

Starang coming like a hurricane with no fear
Cause in the streets we ain't got no peace
Shoot the beast from the east but you run from police
Don't try me, cause I be the bomb like BāZì
Starang from OGC I heat shit up like Hawaii
Five when I'm live like a four wheel drive
Everyday I strive to make you rappers realize
How dangerous Strangle gets on the micro
Phone, when Louieville zones it gets me hyper
The type to, snipe yo ass from up close
This is the Boot Camp show, I'm your host
Starang Wonduh, no relation to Stevie
And no I'm not west Indian or Haitian
But I'm on probation
For knocking wack MC's out daily
Plus I fly heads like comets from Alex Haley
Now tell me, won't this fucking verse right here
Turn a wack rappers day into his worst nightmare
I scare, petty MC's who claim they got gats
Fronting with hoes in videos with pimp hats
But the fact
Still remains that your just a stain on the bottom of my boots
While I'm still Starang
BCC, from ninety-now past two thou
Make y'all heads in the crowd out there wonder how
We be still

He's stepping in hotter this year

Louieville, no fear will shed no tears
Dare you, to come near, bare beat that ass
I pull bats, cock back, release then smash
Niggas is, uhm, stuck on stupid, OD'd off cupid
Bitches and switches is strictly how they have to do it
Like Montell Jordan, I'm giving a warning
You keep that shit up and niggas'll be caving your walls in
But as they close in, chumps get chosen
Stance gets frozen, cause this here beat's about as potent
So hold it, watch how you take those totes
Cause you next will be your last, and thats all she wrote
Killed the small tug no delaying, on sidelines I'm wasting
Procrastinating is sin, so there'll be no delaying

He's stepping in hotter this year

D-O big Kahuna coming in with no fear
Oh yeah, y'all niggas over there, y'all be fronting
Claiming you own a gun but when you see us you run
Now this is one thing Top Dog can't understand
(What?) why men get mangled (uh-huh) why men get mad
So I ask, my bredren till he told me
He caught these brothers flapping, had to smack em wit the chrome piece
Now it's only uno and dos, he and him
He's blowing up spots no matter if he's enemy or friend
So put and end, to all the bullshit, I pull shit quick
And you a gun fool I can't forget
How you get down, cause I get down with four pounds that make sounds
From underground now you don't wanna come around
Here, thats disappointment for life
I'm making sure I'm the one that's taking all your stripes
Now back way, while I get my yipes on

Its Louieville, you know I pack the bat like so
They call me Top Dog, but better known as D.O
Motherfuckers better act like they know

I can be as good as da best the rest, and be as bad as the worst
So don't test we, D.O. has had it up to here
With those niggas that don't be knowin who we are
Have you lost all your respect for the squad?
If so, y'all bitch ass niggas betta get that shit together
Causee D.O.G. will rain on that ass like the weather
Killin em softly with the words that I be bringin
Leavin them niggas smellin and lookin dead and stinkin
Cause we will, face all the trials and tribulations
So arm yourself cause armageddon is now
Let me show you how these punk ass clowns are goin down
Slowly but surely I won't let y'all niggas fold me
Body bag me, put me on a plate and toe tag me
That'll be emphatically non-cipher
They calll me D.O. because D.O. carries power

I Be starang, I represent the Dreads and the 'fros
I be louieville,you know I represent those that know
I be the Top Dawg, Searchin for the big O
Motherfuckers better act like they know

Suckas be hold up
I fold that ass its Ville Slugga
My niggas say I make a bigga nigga run for cover
Fools get caught up with words don't even make me
Put pine to your spine, now you niggas hate me
For reasons
We bring freezers to heated regions
Troopin through your crew like the PM night demon
Fuck looly gaggin talk comin for ya
Crush that ass to dust, just like sawyer
Beans, leavin scenes uglyer than ben
Green cause it seems niggas can't understand a thing
But this is how we set it
Get your peeps and meet us in the exit
Load those weapons cause this fuckin shit can get hectic

I be starang, rock from your head to your toes
It's quiet riot, number two spots get blown
I be D.O. known for the ten second roll
Moherfuckers better act like they know

Starang
I, shot ya
Lock it down now I got cha
For this jam I am the phantom of the opera
Don't say a word, take it to the streets fuck the props
X marks the spot like Sadat
Starang makes shit hot
Lyrics for days you been warned
Call me thunder, the first one out the storm
Now its on, throats get cut like lawns
My nigga O strong packs the 38 long
Skinny nigga, fuck the muscle I don't tussle
Glock the d-o-g and let him bust you
I crush you, your sayin tough guy bullshit may be
But at times they say starang is crazy
Forget it lets just call it he say her say
Fuck you up in like the worst way
Blow that ass out like candles on your birthday
Brother, make you and your mom-dukes run for cover
So who's the crew runin all through your section
Black smif n wessun connection

I be the Top Dawg to nice up your body
Tell everybody to leave the shottie shake your body
Top Dawg to nice up your party
Tell everybody to leave the shottie shake your body
I be starang, play yourself and catch the sharp elbows

Originoo Gunn Clappaz,"[Chorus: 2x]
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys

[Sadat X]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All of y'all out there might think that I'm strange
But the wild cowboy never lived on no range
The only prairie I seen was in the library
And the last Indian I seen was headin towards Cleveland
y'all can believe in what y'all believe in
But stop the bullshittin and deceivin
When the O.K. Corral bell rings for the winter
I'ma flash back to '79 with Thelma drinkin wine
You could see that it was me even with that small screen
Al Green had a major string of hits
And I want to be like him, in the fact, that each one was a gem
My man Mashburn is killin 'em down in Dallas
I seen him one day after this bullshit show called Alice
The wild cowboy is hard to resist
Make the play, get the assist, girlfriends hate genesis
Me and Diamond D +Dug+ deep In The Crates
Been rhymin for high rates, did wild show dates
My name is X yo my name is X, worth more weight than gold
Precious than your baby who's a year old
Step to war without your armor, results in trauma
Mad drama, I'm the mad bomber
Young girls stay away 'cause I'm dangerous
I'm a grown man, don't force my hand
I'll judge off 'cause I can (Cuz I can and I will..)

[Chorus]

[Sadat X]
Hey I got a lot of family on both sides of the tracks
Some is livin positive while others is sellin crack
Two sides to livin yo step up and place your vote
Like a 'murder that she wrote,' hey that's my own qoute
Now should I clear myself for samples?
Or make cats examples of my cowboy status Boyd Roger?
You ever see Oliver Twist and his boostin man Dodger?
Takin wallets in the street, sign my name in the wet con-crete
A big X, so wide ya break ya fuckin legs
For me to be dead-ass, have bread and water in a tall glass,
is lunacy, madness, and I ain't on no badness
But in this point in time I can't take no backward steps (Uh-uh)
I like crisp, green, money, and a lot of it
In big bills, 'cause money right here make this whole world spin
Say you went on a gin, 'cause honey go home with strange men
Dance by the light of the silvery moon
Then wake up in the mornin with the hay in your eyes
Your purple with that herpes bump, who want the rump?
Some niggas joint got a lump from that late night hump
What does it take to be a cowboy? Hold on down boy
'cause I don't got no contracts in my pockets
Kids run up our amp like they stuck they hands in sockets

[Chorus] 2x

[Sadat X]
I rule uptown to Nairu with an iron fist
Grand Master, national titlest
I string people out, plus I bring people out
So Heineken's across the board for all my men
Check it out, I'm verse for now but I'ma do this again
Remember the wild cowboy's in the heart's of all men
But then again some kids ain't never gonna win
And they'll be played in here

Yeah, Nubian style, so versatile
Win by a mile, sack a pen and pile
One nineteen and one twenty

1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue

Can't shut these lips up, never slip up
But on point, just like a stick-up
I shoot my gift to ya gut, like a jailed jukks
And run my line up ya spine like a bomb book
Shook crooked booked, ain't no time for jokin'

Frowns on they faces, when they niggaz draw the tre'pounds
Clowns, front, act like they don't know

Far from bows, so hop ya ass on that fuckin' yellow road
Sowed up, from the toes up, emcee's get no leeway

Judgment day is here and gone
Sweetly she draws me into her arms
A liquid embrace to chase the day way.
Sedate Numb Deaf and Dumb
Stumbling into solitude.

A clouded judgment day is fueled.
Take me under your black wings
Mark my words and remember me.

So sweetly she shucks away at my time
So sweetly she draws me nigh
Closer and closer towards never ending sleep
Spin the bottle
Kiss only the bottle.

The dark mistress of many, beholden to none
Slips a ring of needles around your arm in an engagement
Eternal engagement
Never consummated.
Take me under your black wings
Mark my words and remember me.
Destroyer of senses.

So take as needed for the pain
Another gray morning dawns across an ashen sky.
My sweet demoness beckons me
Ever again and again and again and again.

Rode us all the way to New Orleans

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows

Y que se pega
Y cuando llega no despega, pega, pega
Lo que puso el ruso en el discurso
Que Compay Segundo puso entre tus sejas

Ahora la distancia queda!

Si de mí lengua estoy viviendo
Y calmando mí fiel tristeza
De que forma quieres tú que yo detenga
La sangre de amor y patria
Que me corre por las venas
Generaciones vieja y nueva
De corazón sangre y pulmón

Allá lejos
Donde el sol calienta más
Olvidé mí corazón, un arroyo y un palmar
Dejé mí patria querida
Hace más de un año ya
Por más que me lo propongo
Mí herida no cerrará

Estraño mí tierra querida
Hablar de ella ni lo intentes
Todo el tiempo está en mi mente
La tengo presente, entiende
Me habla el corazón que no me me miente hermano
Flotando ando pasando la mano, mano
Sobre el mapa de éste Mundo
Y desde lo profundo de mí corazón siento nostalgia
Una extraña sensación como añoranza
De ésta distancia que se interpone
Que regresaré bién se supone
Y eso me pone el hombre más felíz por un segundo
Ya lo cantó Compay Segundo y yo de nuevo
Escucha el quejo de mí gente chico
Bién te lo explico
Cubano cién por ciento prototipo

Me arrancaré el corazón
Y esperaré mi regreso
Para sacarlo otra vez
Y colocarlo en mí pecho

Vengo de donde hay un río
Tabaco y cañaveral

Fué tu propio orgullo, con tu mujer destruyó
El fruto que sembraste y al final dejaste hundir es todo tuyo
La vida es riesgosa, tiene su cosa, y en esta prosa
Te ayudo a reflexionar, a veces más que la espina
Pincha el pétalo de una rosa, mira que cosa
Tu lo puedes comprobar
El dinero yo no lo persigo, digo
Partida babilonia en la cabeza te has metido
Y confundido tu futuro lo has partido
Y muchas veces el amigo se convierte en tu enemigo
Mira que lío

Aquí nada cambió, no no
Nadie lo intente
Ni dudas, pobrezas, mujeres, lenguas, ni intereses

Aquí nada cambió, no no
Nadie lo intente

No tiene ningún sentido, que la unión de unos amigos
Se perdiera de esa forma, por dinero y nada más
Yo sólo se la verdad, me callaré mi destino

Aquí nada cambió, no no

Pero yo sé que mi gente mi guateque va a apoyar
Una vez más tu vecino aquí me va a escuchar

Acabe en la Gloria como el pasado

Ah! Nueva canción para ti mi gente
Que nunca me ha fallado en la emoción

Fieles a disentir, tratando de evadir

Cuando lagrimas tú llorabas mamá calmaba pecho

Mujer te canto este himno
Traigo la pura verdad
Incierto why crudo destino
Mi canto contigo está (x 2)

Me resguardo en el lápiz, respíritu
El espíritu se siente happy, nada personality 
Traza why real te hizo a tí mujer, creadora de razas
maltrato físico, castigo duro al que abasalla
Women don't stop, la batalla no está ganada
Resta mucho por andar en esta ganga
Juntos la guerra estará triunfada
What do you want? Respect, don't stress
Hoy por mí serás premiada
It's over, continuaremos la batalla
Toda esta mierda se acabará
Tu posición ya respetada
A altos niveles ya está apoyada

Mujer te canto este himno
Traigo la pura verdad
Incierto why crudo destino
Mi canto contigo está (x 2)

Mujer te canto este himno 
Incierto why crudo destino

Para seguir aquella historia
Que no recordáis
Negocios negros como tumba
Controlando el flight
El rey del Chingo no se cansa
Controlando el mic

Bota fuera

Pedrito sigue suelto en carretera
Controlando el chaca
De su ataque hay manera
Nadie se a atrevido a desafiarlo
why menos modificarlo
Controlarlo o encerrarlo
El negocio de los cuadres
Es su primicia
Pero es claro que una gran estafa
Millonaria se avecina
De un golpe de diablo
Calló al hueco
Por un chivatazo que a la poli
Hijo mío dieron luego
Prosiguieron como siempre
Las debidas detenciones
Calló en ley de nuevo el flaco
Le siguió Fernando El Laco
Esta historia como ves
No ha terminado
De la lengua seguirán contando
Los chicos del barrio

Espero que el fuese

Que ahora quiero a contarles
Una historia verdadera
Joven de valor prestigio why libertad
Era rey de La Habana entera
Era rey de La Habana entera
Repito
Una noche ebrio de todo
Preso de desilusión
Sin conciencia ni control
A su novia why a su amigo
Liquidó por confusión
why claro fue condenado
A veinte años de prisión
Dieciséis meses más tarde
Directo hacia el pelotón
Derere rabadero rebodipodá badá badá

Que me cita a salir, a compartir
El mundo que he dejado aquí a mi paso
No quiero rechazo, al caso
Seguir la misma historia
Que en mi gloria del Vedado
El barrio que le canto
Con los pinches a mi lado
Al business yo progreso Cayo Hueso
El barrio que le debo lo que yo he hecho
Solo el pecho
Fumando cosas de esas que te ponen
Mala la cabeza, he confundido
Armonía por tristeza
why no me pesa
Si Dios me bendice
El diablo me confiesa
¿Quién es esa?
¿Quién separa el territorio de mi hogar?
Sin preguntar, quiere robar, sin mas hablar
Coge el bate que sofoca, golpe a la cabeza
Sangre brota, prendó la luz que toca
Miró en el suelo se encontraba
Sorpresa grande loca me esperaba
Yo no sabía nada

Cubanos que de mientras se han salvado
Y en vano prosigo, y digo:
¿Qué has sido?
¿Amigo o enemigo?

No hay palabras para mencionarte
Tampoco momentos lindos
Para recordarte

No queda nada de lo de ayer
Sin caminar no se puede correr

Aprendí a escribir carbonerías en mi libreta
Y con un mismo idioma sacudir todo el planeta
Aprendí que mi pueblo todavía reza
Porque las fucking autoridades y la puta realeza
Todavía se mueven por debajo' e la mesa
Aprendí a tragarme la depresión con cerveza
Mis patronos yo lo escupo desde las montañas
Y con mi propia saliva enveneno su champaña
Enveneno su champaña

Sigo tomando ron

Tengo tu antídoto
Pa'l que no tiene identidad
Somos idénticos
Pa'l que llegó sin avisar
Tengo tu antílico
Para los que ya no están 
Para los que están y los que vienen

Tengo tu antídoto
Pa'l que no tiene identidad
Somos idénticos
Pa'l que llegó sin avisar
Tengo tu antílico
Para los que ya no están 
Para los que están y los que vienen

En tu sonrisa yo veo una guerrilla
Una aventura un movimiento
Tu lenguaje, tu acento
Yo quiero descubrir lo que ya estaba descubierto
Ser un emigrante ese es mi deporte
Hoy me voy Pa'l norte sin pasaporte
Sin transporte
A pie, con las patas
Pero no importa este hombre se hidrata
Con lo que retratan mis pupilas
Cargo con un par de paisajes en mi mochila
Cargo con vitamina de clorofila
Cargo con un rosario que me vigila
Sueño con cruzar el meridiano
Resbalando por las cuerdas del cuatro de Aureliano
Y llegarle tempranito temprano a la orilla
Por el desierto con los pies a la parrilla
Por debajo de la tierra como las ardillas
Yo vo'a cruzar la muralla
Yo soy un intruso con identidad de recluso
Y por eso me convierto en buzo
Y buceo por debajo de la tierra
Pa' que no me vean los guardias
Y los perros no me huelan
Abuela no se preocupe que
En mi cuello cuelga la virgen de la Guadalupe

Oye para todos los emigrantes del mundo entero
allá va eso, Calle 13

Yo sé que muchos pagarían por besar tu boca
Pero esa dicha marcar, mira niña no me toca
Como un puñal tu recuerdo en mi sombra
Por esto adiós pecado, mira, mira no me toca
Como Adán y Eva, Eva, Eva
Así se eleva mi pecado
No sé cómo llamarte, si princesa roja o niña, niña
No quiero volver a comer de aquella manzana podrida
Igual lo que me digas no importa
Si tú eres quien domina
Y transporta la sangre de mis venas a este humilde corazón
Cerrando sus grietas, como Romeo y Julieta

No tengo dinero ni lujo para impresionar
Amor es lo único que tengo pa' entregar
Si lo quieres bien y sino no pasa na'
Antes de que decida dame tiempo pa' invitarte
Si vienes comigo esta noche en la rumba quizás puedas enamorarte
De momento traigo melodia pa' embrujarte
Y esta serenata con bembé pa' descargarte

Eh ah ah
Ah la la eh
Eh ah ah, la la

Muchos me dijeron a mi que era dificilísimo enamorarte
Pero serenata bembé yo te traje llenita de amor para atraparte
Tú no te preocupes, yo le pregunté a tu padrino si puedo acerarme
Me dijo que sí, que no hay lío siempre que no haya delito de carne

Déjala que baile pero nunca sola
Porque ese detalle nunca se les escapa a los michos que están en la zona
No te precipites ni te desesperes
Yo como sombra detrás de ti, cuidando tus bienes

Hecha pa' aca y piensa que esta serenata es tu obra
Y aquel que no te hayas sabido querer
Pues, que se quede en la cola
Y tocar tu piel en la mía, que eso me calienta la sangre en las venas
Y yo como un loco detrás de ti me enamoro nena

Eh ah ah

No es dolor, necesito de ella

Encuéntrame mi amor, búscame, no te pierdas
Dame ya el amor, haz que esta noche me pierda

Dice que tiene bembé
Que tienes algo, que tienes sandunga
De que la nena lo baila
De que le gusta mi rumba
Tú me dices como hacemos
Señorita, yo no juego
Esto si suena, es noticia
Se te unieron los caballos
Todo está bien
Todos están happy
Llegaron los michos del gueto a la fiesta
Apréndete esta que es una indirecta
Para ver si nos vemos a la vuelta
Dimos que vuelta
Llegamos para aquí, todo quedó
Y todo el mundo rompió la rutina
Sáqueme de esta su vuelta
Que esto salió de la esquina

Con dignidad y respeto

And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And we shall sail, my love and I

The sweetest flower when first it's new

And fades away like morning dew

And watches the ships that go sailing

It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

At the hour of half past eight

Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she tossed it, then she brushed it
On her lap was a silver comb

A maid so fair since I did roam

Catching a moth in a golden net
When she saw me, then she fled me
Lifting her petticoat over her knee
