Showaddywaddy,"One, two! 
Three, Four! 
She likes to take Teddy on down the local jive, 
She's been known to set every man alive, 

But its so hard to get near the love look in her eyes, 
But once your there you never want to go. 
She's a rock 'n' roll lady, 
Bells upon her toes, 

She's got rings on her fingers, 
She can have music, 
Wherever she goes, 
Wherever she goes, 
Wherever she goes. 

For the price of a ticket at a picture show, 
You can hold her hand when the lights are low, 
But its so hard to get near the love look in her eyes, 
But once your there you never want to go. 

She's a rock 'n' roll lady, 
Bells upon her toes, 
She's got rings on her fingers, 
She can have music, 

Wherever she goes, 
Wherever she goes, 
Wherever she goes. 

She's a rock 'n' roll lady, 
Bells upon her toes, 
She's got rings on her fingers, 
She can have music, 

Wherever she goes, 
Wherever she goes, 
Wherever she goes. [Repeat to fade]",Rock & Roll Lady,1999

Showaddywaddy,"Uh-look-ah there
There she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59

Showaddywaddy,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

Oh honey, I don't know
What it is you got
All I know is that you got what it takes
Um, to take what I got

Oh now some boys say
They love your walk

All I know is that you got what it takes
Ooh, to take what I got
Hah hah, yeah

I wrote this song but it ain't rock 'n' roll
But if it means something don't let it die
It gets me down when I should be so high
If there's a song I just gotta sing
I'd be accused of doing my own thing
One of these days, one of these nights
You're gonna find out that I was so right 
One of these days, one of these nights
You're gonna wake up and see the light
The road is long, it's so bumpy and hard
You tend to drop all the things you discard
And all the ideas you get on the way
Were only thought of the very same day
And you can say no concerts are the same
But our concern is maybe you're a little insane
One of these days, one of these nights 
You're gonna find out that I was so right 
One of these days, one of these nights
You're gonna wake up and see the light

I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you
Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light

Baby do you know what you took away?
You took the blue out of the sky

And I keep cryin', cryin'

Oh baby, oh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
'Cause if I never saw the sunshine baby
Then maybe I wouldn't mind the rain

Every day is just like the day before
All alone, a hundred miles from shore
All of my dreams, I dream with you
Now they will die and never come true
And so I'm cryin', cryin'

Oh baby, oh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
'Cause if I never saw the sunshine baby
Then maybe I wouldn't mind the rain

There wouldn't be this pain
And I know there wouldn't be
Cloud that's over me everywhere I go

Oh baby, oh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
But if I never saw the sunshine baby
Then maybe I wouldn't mind the rain

I wouldn't mind the rain
Oh, that pain
Oh, that rain
That sunshine

Speak to your speaker, cause it's the time of day

We're deeper than the ports in the back of your cerebellum
Dres, Dre, and Showbiz is rippin this shit, so tell them
We came, we saw, we broke the fuck out

You play, you lay, but if you give good hay you can stay

So do you want to change for the children with a comma?
For who? Me, I, myself, you know the one
Doing what I gotta do when I do, come

Don't get jel if we cash large checks

Brothers think I'm dissing, but I'm really on the dicks
Look into my album, kid, you'll see all the flicks

So I was boning mama and your mother fucking told me

I'm playing, I really got no time on the real

Black boots, black hat, slick like a black cat
Flip like a fat cat? Never none of that, black

So many styles, you don't know which one is coming next
We've been bouncing to the ounce for months

Showbiz,"It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now separate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use, is cap-I-tal punishment
But Jesus Christ, was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in  electric chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it
You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using

        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can achieve
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct
Or incorrect, take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up!  I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated?
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but obviously Eve had it goin on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus

        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

Yo yo
Yo bring that back

Never sweat that

Sorry black, that's right it's a cardiac arrest
Try to triple team the best?
Then where's party at?
Lost to no one, a warrior like Shogun
And when the show's done stacks and stacks is how the hoes come
I bruise your feelings, confidence is to the ceiling
If I'm sick, I pick a chick for sexual healing
I'm unique, a freak like Malik
In the twilights with more highlights than Dominique
Around my boys is where the jel stops
Up to the streets, the jeeps, my peeps in the cell blocks
I'm not the best but I give you stress

Stop bluffing 'cause you ain't saying nothing, G
And start ducking I'm the A to the fucking G

Suckers better get they own identity
And to the enemy, you better roll like it's ten of me
Fake lords they get strangled with mic cords
Taking beats from my LP for sure ain't healthy
Patterson Projects is where I rest
But I claim the whole planet cos it's mine goddamn it
I'm God, quick to pull a fake brother card
Wrecked Boston, running shit in Portland like Rod
It's hard to face defeat when you're raised in the street
No surrender and no retreat
Now dance with the devil? No not hardly
Even though I mamba like La Bamba and smoke ganja like Bob Marley
A bag of sess puts me at my rest
You say it's silly, that's my theory
Get the philly and let it rest

Don't think I'm live? Then take a swigga
'Cause I'm from Queens and I roll with Bronx niggas

Check it, check it, check what I say
You can bounce with Dres, or you can bounce with Dre
You can flip the script, or you can parlay
Or you can learn the words and say what we say

If you're chilling with your crew (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're hitting up some skins (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're cooling at a club (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
No matter what you're doing, no matter what you're doing

[A.G.]
They say more bounce to the ounce, well a Giant weighs tons
Stepping to the two, but we're not the ones
Brothers are flipping, some other suckers are tripping
Yeah, you gotta take a whipping to see that I'm live and kicking

I'm the A to the G-I followed by the A-N-T rolling with the Show be	-I
Black boots, black hat, slick like a black cat
Flip like a fat cat? Never none of that, black
But I got techs for those who want to flex

So many styles, you don't know which one is coming next
We've been bouncing to the ounce for months
Finesse is here, yeah, Premier's got the blunts
Jazzy's getting jazzy, Big L is raising hell

Show is bugging with the beats, and he's Bhudded, can't you tell?
Diggin in the Crates is in our corner
Ice Water, Deshawn, and Long is getting longer
Gary Gator got the lethal

Infinite, Today, yeah they are my people
Act like Dres, because he's living fat
And say ""You can bounce to this, or you can bounce to that""
My respect, and all that dough is all that counts
I'm out, and yo Dres let's make them bounce

If you're chillin on the ave (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're cooling in your house (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're rocking in a waterbed (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
No matter what you're doing, no matter what you're doing

If you're on lockdown (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
Got the boom in your box (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
Even if you're deaf (Bounce ta this)
No matter what you're doing, no matter what you're doing

Listen, this is Dres, and I'm letting ya know
That S-H-O-W-be	-I-Z and A.G. are all that

Showbiz & A.G.,"""I like my pockets fat not flat"" (repeat 4x)

""I like my pockets fat not flat"" ""So get back"" (repeat 4x)

[Showbiz]
My pockets stay fat, and they always like that
Not only in pocket but in my bank there's stacks and stacks of dough
Cause I move slow, I get my cash flow, and then I go
And brother's don't know, I'm on the down low
Some get mad cause they can't understand
That I'm 23 years old, I'm in command
I'm down with DITC, that's ""Diggin' in the Crates""
And my partner A.G., we always keep crazy papes
I'm staying fat, cause what comes around goes around
I always help out and help a brother when he's down
And out like a boyscout, brothers always shout
""Good lookin out Show""  Yeah, without a doubt
But don't try and take advantage
I'll just leave you alone instead of putting that ass in bandages
Signing off is Show be	-I-Z
And next up is A.G., he likes his pockets F-A-T

""I like my pockets fat not flat""  (repeat 4x)

[A.G.]
Check it out yo, A.G. is living fat
In the mental, in other words can I get a soul clap?
Diggin' in the crates for something smooth
Showbiz & A.G., yo money, we make the party groove
And I'm a top-notch competitor
Carrying dough like a treasurer
Getting pussy, oh that's regular
But the sex I never take
Cause if that bitch screams rape, like Mike Tyson, I'm upstate
And you know that's a fact, black
So if she says no, that means no, and that's that
No matter how cute or how desperate
(Ayo she gotta get the boot)  Yeah, she gotta see the exit
But I'm not mad I didn't hit it
I just dial seven digits and some skins that's with it
Bones in the closet, that's my logic
You gotta be smart and keep a downlow in the projects
Watch your step and take it easy
Or act like Stevie Wonder because you know you can't see me
Don't sniff no coke, but I might drink a brew
Or maybe two (Andre the Giant, not you)
Yeah, wrecking MC's with just my demo
And pulling all the cuties with no problemo
That's right, because I'm a gamer
Your girl let you for me, A.G., I don't blame her
Step back, get your sticks and your bats
Know you step up because my pockets are fat

""I like my pockets fat not flat""  (repeat 3x)

[Showbiz]
It's time to take the brothers from the corner
Clean up they act, and give them a chance to do what the want to
I'm not trying to be a bum with a 40
That's not my style, I gotta work hard like Naughty
By Nature, you should understand
To get yours in this land, you gotta work for yours, black man
You think it's easy because I rap?
So don't ask me for a dollar motherfucker, you ain't handicapped
And if you was, you'd still have the chance
Look how I flip ""ain't this a bitch"" now I'm making you dance
Yeah it's Show be	-I-Z from your neighbor H-double-O-D, I are-A-P
Cause I want to stay fat
To keep clothes on my back and you know I never slack
For all the bums that said I forgot where I came from
Eating crumbs on the corner in the slums
I'm hungry enough to grow fangs
Here's a dollar, go to the store, but give me back my fucking change
I'm not trying to spend on so-called friends
Not even with skins, put that bullshit to an end
So fuck the groupies on tour
I'm trying to make a million dollars, some shit I never saw before
So save that bullshit for later
So when I'm large, hoes give me head on an escalator
Yeah, I like to flow, I'm Show be	-I-Z

(I'm the calm one, but my crew is sorta sick)
Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

[Chorus]

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.
(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

Sorry black that's right it's a cardiac

And when the show's done stacks and stacks is how the O's come
I bouge your feeling confidence is to the ceiling
If I'm sick I pick the chick for sexual healing
I'm unique a freak like Malik
In the twilights with more highlights than Dominique
Around my ? is where the jell stops
The jeeps the streets my peeps in the cell block
I'm not the best but I keep it stressed
To flatter me is strategy it gotta be more complex than chess
Stop bluffin cause you ain't saying nothing gee
Start duckin I'm the A to the fuckin G
Last LP we got down right
Showing all these corny motherfuckers what hiphop's supposed to sound
Like
See A.G. and the brother Show
Quiet as kept is best that you step on the low

Well it's me meaning the A to the dash
I'm fast to get the cash now I'm going like the path
What's the remedy suckas better get their own identity
And took the enemy you better roll like it's Cannamy
Fake lords they get strangled with mic cords
Taking beats from my LP for sure ain't healthy
Madison Projects is where I rest
But I claim the whole planet it's mine god dammit
I'm God took the bulla fake ?
Wreck Boston running shit ?
It's hard to face the feet when you're raised in the street
No surrender and no patrique
Now dance with the devil no not hardly
Even though I mamba like a bomber and smoke ganja like Bob Marley
A bag of sess puts me at my rest

Armor plated, fire breathing

My will be done, done did it
Did the everything that leads to nothing
And breathing in the rotten stink
Feeling something, something leads to nothing

Screeching, singing something into me
The light, it flees
Open up the earth, my veins, my legs
My throat, my head, my soul is dead

Yeah, I am

Yeah, I am
I am the nothing in me

Breaking down the walls that you leave up
To keep me from eating the tree of knowledge
Suck that fruit and spit the seed
Leave behind the sad and spineless

Part the sea and break apart the crust
Let me in the darkest tunnels at night
Let your spirit sag like a skin molting
Let it drop, shut out the ugly light

I'ma knock yo ass down like the black Jackie chan.
The squad ain't loosing. These bitches keep choosing.
And that's why (ay, ay).

[Smurf]
Let me get em. Man I gotta hit the flow.
Step into my fighting stand. And then I crank that Rambo.
Anyone can come and get it.
It's a war that I declare.
If you want a double duo. Then I bring out yogi-bear.
Watch us hit you left and right.
Combos coming once or twice.
We becoming stupid fast. Have yo whole clique scarred for life.
Flawless victory on deck.
But its time for round two.
Put my hands up on my hips,
Then I crank my Scooby-doo.

[Chorus]

[Mike Dingo]
Hey, they love to see me move.
Me and my whole crew.
Cause every time I lean they watch spectators try to do it too.
So they keep on hesitating & hate, I put em in they place.
I call my boy Tookie then we whoop Rico in his face.
No time to conversate.
This ain?t the time or place. Watch me have to whoop a nigga ass
Like my name was Billy blanks.
This left a leave ya.
Then my dance, we crucial like brutality.
We leave y'all whole click stuck. Like we stole the damn scene.

[Trez]
They said em twice. Another third times a charm.
But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain?t no harm.
He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can?t do it quite like me.
Cause he keep doing the same ole move, constantly.
Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flow.
Bout to get real crazy, don't turn yo head. We bout to start the show.
First you bend yo back, and lift yo head. Use yo hands and block yo head.
Roll yo arms and show yo swag. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yea).

Nothing titillating or deliciously decayed
I guess the truth is nothing special but elusive anyway

Go down on the river bank the watchman shines his torch
But he sees no sign of the exquisite corpse
He sees no sign of the exquisite corpse

All the clues are added up to make a wider scheme
The patterns are so intricate like opiated dreams
The characters I see are only actors in a play
A seedy tv drama to be screened around midday

I follow her to price-check
And get the girl to talk about
Her father and his lawyer and the exquisite corpse
Her father and his lawyer and the exquisite corpse

The city murmurs in its sleep incriminating sounds
Its poisons and its weaponry are scattered all around
I know there's more to all of this than I can touch or see
It's dead and cold and dangerous, but elegant to me

With burning eyes and coffee breath and then a day in court
Still I lay fifty pences on the eyes of this exquisite corpse

So we can live without blame
We don't know where we're going, but we know
That all things will be ours on the Shining Path

As soft and discreet as Uranium
Your silver voice called us to action, the parts we play
Are illusions that seem like we really are.
If we were different some other time we don't remember
But there is one thing we know -
There is nothing in explanation, and we can see
You and I hand in hand on the Shining Path

Casts a shadow limp as sleep
It goes on forever

The words unspoken the line uncrossed

Buried secrets - the flesh won't keep

This is our mission, to be the darlings of God
Too late for silence, too late for anything
It's all too much for me, its roots go down too deep for me

A punishing fire, an animal frenzy
These hammerhead people know what danger is for
You let them in and now they're everywhere

Marching, balancing, in too far to go back
Yes, yes, hammerheads, swimming, kissing
We are big and clever and we don't know anything

We know the only things you like are paranoid sex and childish greed

Faith don't come so easily
This proves nothing, only bursting bubbles
Legs open: eyes crossed, pressing on the nerve

Cased in armour; 20,000 body guards

Shriekback,"They smile like nothing happened
They look out on the sea
The waves go splash & they don't care
These hard facts indicate to me that:
We're all built the same way -
Subject to the same laws
We all got our influences, I say: why shouldn't I?

We are not lovable in the usual way
The sun shines down on us this day & everyday
We are the pretty boys - self critical - self employed
I feel dangerous & I say: why shouldn't I?

They love this kind of detail
They ape the things they see
This all links up with what I knew -
It all seems sinister to me
My sacred mess my saving graces?
Insufficient alibi - I reason: why shouldn't I?

Some going out some coming round
Some moving up - some slowing down
We learned something back there
Something that licks it's way in - religiously
And I say: why shouldn't I?

One more song to go

This is a pure thing
These hands I kiss
Tragic as anything
These eyes are blind
This is a pure thing
All splash and hiss
Beyond my measuring

Only the anacrucis
The main event remains
Shameful and naked, out there
In the great cold outdoors
We have to learn these things again
Bathe in this incandescent glow
The leap to something I don't know
There is no doubt upon us when
The greasy men come back again

These eyes are blind
This is a pure thing
These hands I kiss
Tragic as anything
These eyes are blind
This is a pure thing

Precious as memory
A veil of cloud

But they don't work no more
I loved you once
Don't love you anymore

Shriekback,"This was the holy land when they were more popular than God
Upon this bridge of black and white their sacred naked feet have trod
Seers and angels, they saw what no one saw before
And now with closed eyes they walk from shore to shining shore

[Chorus]
But is it still the Beatles' zebra crossing?
Is it still the Beatles' zebra crossing? [Repeat: x3]

And now the faithful come here as pilgrims to a shrine
They walk the stations of the crossing
Their feet are bare their eyes are blind
Friends with cameras click to record the ritual
And back home all around the world the same picture hangs upon their walls

[Chorus]

But history moves mysteriously and nothing stays here for too long
They scorch the zebra from the road and paint a new one further on
But it still means what it meant then and it still looks much like it did
The pilgrims take their pictures still, its guilty secrets they stay hid

[Chorus]

That used to be a warehouse then
And this was all bombed in the war
And here the last wild boar was slain
And there my father met my ma
This was the place where I was born
And in the sixties this was hip
And right through here the Romans came
And this was where it all began

Every urge leads to something you can sit on

Every mystery turns into something you can see
And every small desire turns into something you can buy or hire

Shriekback,"Up the stairs, go through the cupboards, secrets are to me
The droppings of the animal I stalk relentlessly
Nothing titillating or deliciously decayed
I guess the truth is nothing special but elusive anyway

Go down on the river bank the watchman shines his torch
But he sees no sign of the exquisite corpse
He sees no sign of the exquisite corpse

All the clues are added up to make a wider scheme
The patterns are so intricate like opiated dreams
The characters I see are only actors in a play
A seedy t.v drama to be screened around midday

I follow her to price-check
And get the girl to talk about
Her father and his lawyer and the exquisite corpse
Her father and his lawyer and the exquisite corpse

The city murmurs in its sleep incriminating sounds
Its poisons and its weaponry are scattered all around
I know there's more to all of this than I can touch or see
It's dead and cold and dangerous, but elegant to me

With burning eyes and coffee breath and then a day in court
Still I lay fifty pence's on the eyes of this exquisite corpse

Shriekback,"Where are the bones and the flowers?
Where are the shrines to the local gods?
They never write now or ring us
Whatever happened to the local gods?
What are their names? Where do they live now?
Where do we go to light a candle to them now?

They held the soul of the city
The streets were bright with the local gods
The days were sweet with their meanings
The nights were vivid with the local gods
The day they left we never saw their going
We woke one morning and the world was less than it had been

In the canals and the wastelands
Up in the spires, under the flyovers
Still you can see, with the right eyes,
The shining presence of the local gods
Stand in the silence you can hear them whisper
Hearing their laughter echo in the steel and stone

So leave a fire in the window
Pour the wine under the underpass
Let's all go down to the river
We'll go swimming with the local gods
They never died we only lost their number

Or can dream around
Flesh and bone and concrete talk

Very few straight lines
Never any questions asked

Psycho drift
Psycho drift

Through the parks and alleyways
Hopelessly amazed
Builder's yards and lavender
Watch the mind at play

Underneath the railway arch
Night and day are one
Found a new world in between
The shadow and the sun

The wine, the cheese, the bottle and the barricade

The shit, the shop, the roses and the underpass
The coin, the cloth, the carpet and the drum
The rain, the dog, the bonfire and the photograph

Like the swallows in the winter
Like the swarming of the bees

Call it energy at play
Call it spirit into matter

I spray myself right before I leave the crib

Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin' corners in my Cadillac escalate
It's summertime and I'm scorchin', fuck a bulletproof

Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')

Gotta couple hoes workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a ho don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah

Man it seems like I'm duckin' dodgin' bullets everyday
Niggas hatin' on me cause I got, hoes on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder
North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th Street bound
Where niggas all the time end up lost and never found
Man these girls think we prove thangs, leave a big head
They come hopin' every night, they don't end up bein' dead
Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimpin'
Gotta have my hustle tight, makin' change off these women, yeah

Sie gab mir diese Adresse, hoff' der Brief kommt an
Bist du wieder in Marseille? Ich hör' die Tour war lang
Anbei n'dat, vielleicht machen wir'n Tune zusamm'
Wir basteln an der neuen Platte in der Bude vom Don
No sé Studio One, und es wär cool wenn du kommst
Vielleicht im Januar, kurz nach Hannukah
Four zahlt das Ticket, Günne checkt das Business mit Fabian
Das Konzept ist Briefwechsel, und da du auch eher bildlich textest
Sag ich lieber nicht zuviel zu Message
Stuttgart ist nicht Marseille, doch Menschen teilen Schicksal
Die gleichen Stigmas, die gleiche Politik samt gleichem Ritual
Man führt seinen täglichen Kampf, in seiner Welt gefangen
Schnell ist der Horizont nur noch der eigene Tellerrand
Shurik'n ich hoff du hast Visionen für das
Lass es mich bald wissen schreib' zurück

Yo Max j'ai bien reça ta missive j'ai quelques idées prècises
On peut faire un bon truc pour moi c'est cool pour moi ça y est j'déboule
Je pense que pour le sujet il n'y aura pas de problème
J'ai déjà noté quelques phrases sur feuille j'sais que tu fais de même
Et peut-être qu'on écrit les même après tout le malin joue
La même pièce partout chaque fois il change de scène c'est tout
On doit subir les mêmes préjugés la même méfiance
Les mêmes contrôles musclés de merde qui t'gâchent la journée,2
Le même silence je sais on doit se coltiner les mêmes cons qui n'aiment que la
Main culte
Et ceux qui pour un billet de cent sans regret te buttent je lutte
Mais la certitude persiste triste constat m'incite à rester incisif pour pas que
Je ramolisse
Je le dois à ceux qui m'ont fait et ceux qui font ce que j'suis

Encore un qui ira pas jusqu'au terminus que dire de plus
Les choses arrivent tout le monde proteste mais personne ne bouge et
On regarde sa montre et un surin perce le sol vire au rouge
Et merde tu passes ta vie à vouloir sortir de la nasse
Hélas des coups de crasse affluent la poisse ...
Plein d'vices j'ouvre l'oil le bon fils et j'm'exprime avant qu'on m'opprime
Je rime je rime j'apporte ma pierre à l'édifice fils
Facile, faut que tu bosses mec les choses
Se gagnent pas comme ça faut que tu oses mec en bas il y a pas de hasard
Y'a des envieux des jeunes qui touchent à tous les jeux dangereux
Et s'ils sont chanceux après deux trois pétards ils rêveront à mieux
Pendant c'temps là les mères frisent la crise et les bizz
N'arrangent rien quand la grande porte grise se referme

Die Welt nicht hinzunehm' während Unrecht passiert
Schnell lebst du deinem Ego und bist uninteressiert
Gibst deine Stimme zur Wahl und meinst du kannst jetzt verstummen
Wir brechen die Omerta, noch ist Schweigegeld nicht Landeswährung

Le sort collabore à emporter des fois des corps
Le Bad Boy sort quand le coroner s’endort encore
Mourir à trente ans, passer du bon temps
L’angoisse casse l’enfant, fait du frère un type arrogant
Assuré de voir un autre jour sous les coups
Je peux quand même apprécier un coucher de soleil comme vous
Rester lucide si les soucis troublent ma raison
Quand des tours de béton s’érigent à l’horizon
Mais vraiment c’est drôle ; ma philosophie est tel un saule
S’élève vers les cieux, pour replonger plus tard vers le sol

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down 
Between the champaigne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone and I was missing you
He never had the chance cause I broke up the dance 
Before the song was through

Shvona Lavette,"I won't give up this time
I won't face defeat
I won't hide
You can't walk in and out of my life
We gotta start over
We're wasting time
The one life that passes by
Let's trade in our sleepless nights
Don't wanna let you go, no

Should we move on if the love is gone
Should we let go or keep holding on?
Should we stay when you know it's wrong
Should we let go or keep holding on?

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Remember the good times we shared
All that we sacrificed
I just don't wanna lose your love
Good ones are hard to find

Don't give up if the love is gone
Should we let go or keep holding on?
Should we stay when you know it's wrong
Should we let go or keep holding on?

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

This is harder than I thought
Don't know which way we should go
I really want you to stay
But I think it's best we let go
I can't stay losing you
I have my doubts but
I have a feeling that our time is running out

Should we stay when you know it's wrong
Should we let go or keep holding on?

Threw back a shot and started to chill
Ran into a pretty thing named Jane Bang
She said she liked the way I handled my game,
I said thanks, I like the way you handle my thang
She said thanks, now thats money in the bank

Bumped into a hottie named Holly in the hall,
Could've been a mange e toi,
But her friend never heard my music before
So I walked outside to get a little high,
When I got a little bump on my side from a fly
Blue-eyed baby with sex on the mind,
Sally's form the valley, but Sally's still fine

Undressin a Madison in the westend,
Exit, cut to breakfast,
Eggs benidict and a fresh pearl necklace
Legs in the air like a goddamn gymnast,
Please God, I beg for forgiveness,

But now I think I love her since I took her to bed

Took all my time,
Spent all my money on diamonds and wine,

She in the Hollywood scene
Moved to Cali from NYC
It's been eight months and she ain't happy
A couple shots of Patron, she eased the pain
Chased it with some Jack just to smile again
The everyday routine
That broken teen who left her heart close to where she left her dreams
Hidden tucked away so far now they missing
I took her hand and said baby listen
For every moment you waste, there's another right behind it to take its place
Cause life goes on when it ain't so sweet
Don't give up on me
Get back on your feet
If you can take another breath you gon' be okay
Just smile, and forget yesterday

Give all your lovin', give all your war

Wearing a brown sweater

What makes me think she won't be cheating again

Give me a sec and I roll on through

Using nicknames, spittin' game is obsolete

And a lazy susan lying right here next to me

Asking too many questions and receiving no answers
Investing my finances on pills for enhancement
Even got some facial cream so they could think I was handsome

Kissed your lips, after class
We both had history after math
Passive notes teacher askin for em I read em out loud to the class like a poem or a rap
Say it like I mean it with by big toe tap
Head gonna bop back and forth like that
And if you like what you here you can meet me out back..out back

Chorus
Wtih my raincoat on, in the heart of the sun
With my raincoat on, in the heart of the city, heart of the city
I la la lost my mind
I la la lost my lady
I la la lost my mind
But I lu lu love you baby

It cross my mind that I lost my mind, I guess I should check back in sometime
Sometime, the perfect little world rhymes and sometimes it dont fine
Rewind repeat it three times if you mean it, I want a crib by the beach belive it so baby doll Im leavin, baby doll im leavin

Duffle bag filled with clothes, notebook filled with flows
Phonebook filled with hoes by dope hook gone get me closed
My hope is what drives me towards this future like a midnight double feature so how did i blow those tweetas in ya speakers.
Chorus again

Woke up at about noon just thought that I had to be in conciert soon
To get my head lined up and a new tatoo, the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The mac of the year shwayze's a fool, take you to school and pick you up too
Maybe I'd do anyting for you
Maybe I'd do anything for you
Maybe I'd do anything for you
Would you do it for me?

I la la lost my mind(shes out tha door)
I la la lost my lady(shes out tha door)
I la la lost my mind(shes out da door)
But I lu lu love you baby (shes out da door)

I la la lost my mind
I la la lost my lady

Shwayze,"Her name was Mary Jane
She sang, like Etta James
She came and went to easily
And it's strange, how times are changed
I seen Mary yesterday, and she
Don't look the same to me

Baby what's the word?
I ain't trying to kill your mockingbird
I got scared and I started walking backwards
And after I got home alone
I couldn't stop drunk dialing your cellular phone
And when you don't pick up, your hang up hurts
I know I got caught with my hand up her skirt
I'm into sandals with the candle light romance
I go to itunes, to download your slow jams
Typhoon, with the thunder clap
I fell in love with the girl in my summer class
She sat, right next to me
And she made me tell the truth like ecstasy
So, whoa, I gotta slow myself on down
I've been in love before

Marijuana sunshine soul made crazy
Why go back and forth like a maybe?
You and I can flow and say I love sailing
Light brown Elleby on Chip and Dale
Skin say I'm fat but I'm skinny as a rail
Pet snail, I got a freak on her knees
I need a little more made of the American Dream
I want her fired up, yea baby don't try to tie me up
I'm just not the type of guy that'd wanna lie to ya
And if you wanna try to fall in love 
It's going to take a little time
And I won't budge for a minute now
You've got to slow yourself on down

Well she arrived on an astroplane
6:45 on a Saturday
Just in time for the masquerade
Just in time for the masquerade
Well she arrived in a limousine
7:45 on a Sunday
Just in time to see
Me making love to her friend Marie
I said: Baby this ain't what you think
Like I'm supposed to say that 'cause I've seen it on t.v.
Then she ran out into the street
Why this has happened to me?
No, got to slow myself on down
I know where this is going now

Make love to me up against a dirty wall.
'Cause I can't wait to get you home, wait
To get you home.

She tastes like cigarettes and alcohol, up all night
On adderall. Innocent, but not at all.

Pero esta vez sí será de verdad
Ahora yo te pido que saques tus cosas
Y al cruzar la puerta no regreses jamás

Eras tú el que decía amarme
Era yo la que llegó a adorarte

Que seré la mala de la historia

Habla blah blah de mí
Habla blah blah de mí, de mí, de mí

Di lo que quieras habla de mí
Sigue mis pasos que yo iré por ahí
Di lo que quieras habla de mí
Que todos sepan lo que hay dentro de ti

Vuélveme eterna una leyenda
Esa a la que los que como tú le huyan le teman
Voy a ser esa, ya no la buena
Pensándolo bien de aquí ya nada te llevas

Habla blah blah de mí
Habla blah blah de mí, de mí, de mí

Mírame no voy a llorar
Te amé demasiado y ahora me das igual
Ya no temo perderte y te veo
Como el cobarde que eres en realidad

Eras tú el que decía amarme
Era yo la que llegó a adorarte

On TV's and DVD's
Overseas to peep the international thrown

I ain't mad
I'm glad you did wrong

My lac is still chrome
My mansion all stone
My dreads still long
Sebastian's my holmes
He'll tell you I'm grown

Habla blah blah de mí
She say she's sick and sorry
But you done made me famous now
I can't make it out to you pity party
Nineteen seventy six ferrari and I ride I't solo

So you can run your mouth out yolo go ahead

Trying to do all that I could

The stores do not post my poster
And they throw away my flyers
Now

How can I be the one
Making myself into the persons
That who will not give me the chance
I'm pulling and busting and flooding my veins
Just putting me in the spot where they
Laugh and they dance
I'm just a joke to everyone's eyes

If you felt the force. Then you can reply

Nor am crazed

Personne ne pourra me dire,
Qu'on vit de rêve et d'ambitions.
Les jeunes ont perdu le sourire,
Le désespoir tue l'inspiration.
Faut pas se laisser aller la vie est trop courte,
Jamais abandonner, faut garder sa route.

Dire que je n'ai pas
Le courage, c'est comme tout abandonner.
Dire que je ne peux pas,
C'est comme balayer la chance qui m'était donnée.
Dire que je n'ai pas
La force, c'est comme tout abandonner.

Pourquoi
Toujours penser que ça ne peut arriver qu'aux autres
Se dire que tant pis on n'a pas de chance
C'est la vie et c'est de sa faute
Faut pas se laisser aller, on est jeune, l'avenir est devant nous
Jamais abandonner, c'est plus fort que tout.

Dire que je n'ai pas

Dire que je ne peux pas

C'est pour mes frères, mes sœurs dans les quartiers,
Lève ta main et crie victoire.
C'est pour ceux qu'on oublie, les boss de demain, les stars de demain,
Lève ta main et crie victoire.

Qui n'ont le cœur à rien, parce que le crime paye trop bien,
Lâche l'affaire romé, choisi tes pères romé, repositionne toi,

Deux âmes aussi complices, fortes des deux côtés 
Fais l'un pour l'autre 
Et qui marchent au même pas, sans se jeter la faute 

Personne ne peut parler 
Quand dans le respect des autres on décide de s'écarter 
Trop complices baby 
Je peux compter sur toi 

Mais ne crois pas que je suis de celles 
Qui ne s'occupent que d'être belles 
Fragiles et superficielles 
Et crois-moi que je peux être celle 
Qui tient debout tout près de toi 
Complice comme au combat, comme un soldat 
Quand 

Il y a des flashes d'éclairs dans le ciel 
Quand passent les sentinelles 
Le ciel s'assombrit, viens te mettre à l'abri 
Mais il y a des flashes d'éclairs dans le ciel 
Quand passent les hirondelles 
On n'ira pas ailleurs, on se réserve le meilleur",A  l'Abri,2008

Au milieu d'un tourbillon
Comme un bruit qui gronde

Il y a tellement de monde
Je ne comprends pas ce qu'il m'arrive
Est-ce un problème?

Tout ira beaucoup mieux peut-être
Et quand le cœur l'emportera

Jusqu'à la lumière du jour, jusqu'au sommet de la tour 
Ici, ensemble, le temps devant nous

Combien nous l'ont déjà dit, on ne l'aurait jamais cru 
Mais je n'ai peur de rien quand je sens ton souffle fort 
Non je ne crains rien sous la chaleur de ton corps 
Dans le creux de tes bras, comme une enfant, je m'endors

Faut être tellement près (ou prête) pour voir qu'en fait il n'y a qu'une âme désolée. 

Et si les mots ne passent plus, alors gardons les 
Si les chemins ne se croisent plus, alors regardons les

Shy'm,"En apesanteur
Tout est plus beau de là-haut
Je pourrais y passer des heures
A tournoyer, planer comme un oiseau
En apesanteur
J'ai le cœur léger de te sentir sur ma peau
Le temps fait passer les heures, on est si bien
En apesanteur

Parfois seul regard suffit
Parfois de nulle part une image surgit
Et je m'empresse de te revoir
Je ne veux plus de nuit seule dans mon lit
Oh oh
Parfois une seule de tes caresses me suffit
A m'envoyer si haut dans ce coin de paradis
Où l'on se retrouve

En apesanteur
Tout est plus beau de là-haut
Je pourrai y passer des heures
A tournoyer, planer comme un oiseau
En apesanteur
J'ai le cœur léger de te sentir sur ma peau

T'avoir tout près de moi me réchauffe le corps
Mais ça semble si long,
Mais j'aimerais qu'elle traîne encore
Prisonnière de ce moment
Mais volontaire si l'on s'évade comme des amants
Oh oh
Complices, l'euphorie me réchauffe le cœur
Se chamailler de plaisir, à se taquiner des heures
Jusqu'à qu'on se retrouve

Au plus fort de mes désirs de ce cœur qui bat pour toi
Moi qui ne dévoile que si peu, à mi-vois, à petit feu
Qui murmure des yeux, mais je crois qu'on ne pas toujours s'enfuir

Shy'm,"Quand dehors la nuit s'enfuit
Emportée par ses blancs chevaux
Quand le soleil comme une fête
Vient annoncer le jour nouveau
Quand la clarté pâle de l'aube
Vient caresser tes longs cheveux

Et je chante les jours heureux
Je pose ma tête sur ton épaule
Et je chante les jours heureux

Alors le temps s'écoule
Comme l'eau vive d'un torrent
La vie a le goût du bonheur
Et tous les parfums du printemps
Les choses me paraissent plus belles
Quand je les découvre dans tes yeux
Les saisons passent à tire d'aile
Et je chante les jours heureux
Les saisons passent à tire d'aile
Et je chante les jours heureux

Les jours heureux, à vivre à deux
À vivre à deux
Oh oh
Les jours heureux, à vivre à deux
À vivre à deux

Et puis tout doucement
Tu m'invites à prendre ton corps
Tes doigts frémissent sur ma peau
Comme une vague d'écume d'or
C'est l'heure pâle au coin du jour
Le moment des tendres aveux
Quand on sait se parler d'amour
Chanter ensemble les jours heureux
Quand on sait se parler d'amour
Chanter ensemble les jours heureux

Si mes jours se ressemblent
Que l'envie me tourne le dos
Je ne crois à la magie d'un numéro
Que lorsque je le vois

A me glacer les poumons

Shy'm,"J´habite seul avec maman
Dans un très vieil appartement rue Sarasate
J´ai pour me tenir compagnie
Une tortue deux canaris et une chatte.
Pour laisser maman reposer
Très souvent je fais le marché et la cuisine
Je range, je lave, j´essuie,
A l´occasion je pique aussi à la machine.
Le travail ne me fait pas peur
Je suis un peu décorateur un peu styliste
Mais mon vrai métier c´est la nuit.
Je l´exerce en travesti, je suis artiste.
Jai un numéro très spécial
Qui finit en nu intégral après strip-tease,
Et dans la salle je vois que
Les mâles n´en croient pas leurs yeux.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

Vers les trois heures du matin
On va manger entre copains de tous les sexes
Dans un quelconque bar-tabac
Et là on s´en donne à cœur joie et sans complexe
On déballe des vérités
Sur des gens qu´on a dans le nez, on les lapide.
Mais on fait ça avec humour
Enrobé dans des calembours mouillés d´acide
On rencontre des attardés
Qui pour épater leurs tablées marchent et ondulent
Singeant ce qu´ils croient être nous
Et se couvrent, les pauvres fous, de ridicule
Ça gesticule et parle fort.
Ça joue les divas, les ténors de la bêtise.
Moi les lazzi, les quolibets
Me laissent froid puisque c´est vrai.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

A l´heure où naît un jour nouveau
Je rentre retrouver mon lot de solitude.
J´ôte mes cils et mes cheveux
Comme un pauvre clown malheureux de lassitude.
Je me couche mais ne dors pas
Je pense à mes amours sans joie si dérisoires.
A ce garçon beau comme un Dieu
Qui sans rien faire a mis le feu à ma mémoire.
Ma bouche n´osera jamais
Lui avouer mon doux secret mon tendre drame
Car l´objet de tous mes tourments
Passe le plus clair de son temps au lit des femmes
Nul n´a le droit en vérité
De me blâmer de me juger et je précise
Que c´est bien la nature qui
Est seule responsable si
Je suis un ""homme oh"" comme ils disent.",Comme Ils Disent,2012

Shy'm,"Les lueurs immobiles d'un jour qui s'achève
La plainte douloureuse d'un chien qui aboie
Le silence inquiétant qui précède les rêves
Quand le monde disparu l'on est face à soi
Les frissons où l'amour et l'automne s'emmêlent
Le noir où s'engloutissent notre foi nos lois
Cette inquiétude sourde qui coule en nos veines
Qui nous saisit même après les plus grandes joies

Ces visages oubliés qui reviennent à la charge
Ces étreintes qu'en rêve on peut vivre cent fois
Ces raisons-là qui font que nos raisons sont vaines
Ces choses au fond de nous qui nous font veiller tard
Ces raisons-là qui font que nos raisons sont vaines
Ces choses au fond de nous qui nous font veiller tard

Ces paroles enfermées que l'on n'a pas su dire
Ces regards insistants que l'on n'a pas compris
Ces appels évidents ces lueurs tardives
Ces morsures aux regrets qui se livrent à la nuit
Ces solitudes dignes au milieu des silences
Ces larmes si paisibles qui coulent inexpliquées
Ces ambitions passées mais auxquelles on repense
Comme un vieux coffre plein de vieux jouets cassés

Two On Da Road right here
(Uh-huh, something for the radio, nigga)
Two On The Road
Uh, Two On The Road

[Chorus: Sandman: x2]
When you see me at the party homey get at me
And don't be mad when your girl try and spit at me
'cause when the beat got
It ain't no limit to the things that we can do

[12 O'Clock]
I'm at the bar, Long Island Iced Tea
Double shot of Hennessey for this pretty piece
With pretty feet smelling like Victoria Sec'
I could see her bra and panties were pink
Looking Spanish or Greek, finest thing I seen all week
Moving with her cousin and niece
I'm moving with my mans Monk and P
Stand at the wall, long chrome 3-3-3
Pussy for free like ODB, high off the eves
Bitches looking like Pamela Lee
Butt-naked on their hands and knees
Roll up the trees, burn somethin' 'fore we leave
Give your friend your car keys, slide with me

[Shyheim]
Peace
Hey vagina, use my name Davey Crocket
I'm king of the wild frontier, your sex hostage
Mr. Lover-man, what's cooking good lookin?
Let's jump in the frying pan, fuck yo' man
He don't want it with us killas
With E-40 Skrilla, for real-a

[Doc Doom]
Bottle for the Wu years and I'ma hit the flow after a few beers
Just tell the DJ the Black Knights is up in here
Wu-Tang is in here, the whole Killa Bee Gang is in here
And ladies holler when we in here
Cause they know it's Big Pimping going on in here
And in the VIP, ho's take it off in here
So get at me 'cause I know you want to spit at me
And I'd be a fool to let that fat ass pass me

[Shyheim]
You want to ride in the 600 baby
With your head out the window like ""Hey hey""
Tell everybody in the hood you my lady
We big up for life so you crazy

[Prodical]
This killer dog puffin green gandy, ready to sink through some panties
Caught some eye candy, sipping on Coke mixed with Remy
Yo Monk, shorty got a lot of junk in her trunk
Now she surfing through the crowd for our weed and skunk
A nigga 12, dropping treasures like the jewels of the Nile
Twenty-seven, man-child from the Isle of Shaolin
We sky Sushi bar, Meoshi par, finest cigars
And the ladies in the place want to know who we are
Gumah Oz Dubar, my hand all in her bra
So what's the deal ma'? Can me and my Clan Bar Mitzvah?
Call your girlfriends, after-party, house on the hill
Come and do real, she said ""I'm burning heart off the pill""
Drinks for free, I got my own VIP
Two or three, or it can be just you and me
Let's get it on and popping, crack-a-latin with no debating
No time for the faking, baby girl what's shaking?

[Monk]
Catch Monk in the midst of party cracking, don't dance
But I boogie to the beat low key, I stay splashed
And drunk still drinking, popping major with the ho's, I'm grooving
With this fat bitch, she stuck with my slang and my dress code
I got close, whispered ""What's up with the Bar Mitzvah?""
Then I grabbed her ass, she laughed with a porno look
And pussy popped her ass on rhythm with the beat
But passed, she with her man but her friends came two cars deep

Hah hah, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, Kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
'Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hand, you still can't get no cards
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playin cards
But if I got beef and it's time for code red
My drill is like a hoe, and be takin mad niggaz to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join a army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burnin Scoob, ""I don't think so mate""
I got the style that gets you open like a bag of smoke
I have your friends ""Ah-hah man, that shit ain't dope""
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
and play like E.T. and phone your black ass ho-wome
Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groo-hoove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Sauce:]
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
how you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
N. B. A. style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight I write left-handed
'Cause I like, to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win, lose or draw, I'm bookin whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
if I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Suckin and luckin, hey, niggaz I'm duckin, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if your down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Shyheim:]
Yo, yo
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killin'
when I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
'Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'ma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child locks you down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a Trailerload with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Now tell me whoooo is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And steppin to me, thinkin I can be touched? Huh
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, Jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What did I just show ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
and see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leavin rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none! Huh
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me, 
but with with speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistible, non-competible
No, No I'm not sayin' I'm the best, I'm just sayin' I'm fuckin' incredible!
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

[Jay-Z:]
Uh, one checkin it two, checkin it three
Check out the J, check out the A, check out the why, check out the Z
Hey G!

And these nuts if you rappers tryin ta see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it runnin a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggaz can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eatin me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be 
between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you lovin the way it's, goin down baby
So Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove

[Ol' Dirty Bastard:]
Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a FLICK, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
she says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame

We was chillin on the ave buggin out lookin dap
And these 4 cold boys rolled up in a cab
They pulled out a tool said get against the wall
Fuck that, rather brawl then go out at all
My man pushed back, body pulled the trigger
Nah G, not Amsin, that's my main nigga
His body hit the floor, blood covered the ground
How that sound? I didn't even give my last pound
The red glare with these tears made me shed
Now I'm fed
My right hand man could be dead
Hell no, I couldn't let him flee that ain't me
Or have me and my crew lounge in peace
So we dash, put the gladiatior on that ass in the grass
His life is now come to pass
The fear made him shrimp, aw shit the gun slipped
My man picked up the burner and emptied the clip
In his back, no slack jack it's time to retreat back
Wipe the gat and pack it in the napsack
Yo be out, cause 5.0 is soon to come
And get arrested and bagged for murder one

I know a kid named Dane, he had mad fame
In the drug game, throwin his life down the drain
He slang mad rocks on the block til it got hot
Then he hit the jackpot, now he owns a crackspot
He always got blunted, smoked up the Philly
Now he use White Owl minks with his illy
Props, had lots and girls around his finger
The neighborhood banger and the hot rock slinger
The cops is on his back, left, right, right and left
He had a plan that was def so he stepped
He stuck up Bill, the one from up the hill that was chill
Now Bill wants to kill Dane dead
For his name and his fame so he did
He lit up the kid with lead in his head
Now Dane's dead

There's a party goin on down the block
Pack up, load the gats now my whole crew's strapped, what!
Bring the drama, Shaolin against all ya
My crew's in here deep ready to bomb ya
I got the ill rhymes, nigga's lookin for a show
But it's gettin kinda hectic on the mad down low
Honies with the big butts whine to get stuck
And they kill a bitch and it's time to get bucked
Boom baow, niggas want to drop cause it's real hot
And some knucklehead wants to blow up the spot
Pulls out a gat or burner he's the man
Except he ain't down with the Clan check the plan
Shorty's backed up cause we're true to the crew
Doin what we gotta do with a 40 ounce of Wu
Crashed to the head, 2 seconds from bein dead
And it stopped, when these 2 kids busted shots
The party's in a smash and the Wu got it locked up
It's it, the man on the mic is a props

Shyheim,"Intro:
This Bob Billiard for the Entertainment News
In the news today yoth rapper Shyheim AKA the Rugged Child 
is rapidly climbing the charts and making a lot of noise
Shyheim seems to be one of those little boy rappers
Who are making a lot of money.
Personally I don't think a little boy should get paid

Verse One:

Don't call me boy! (why?) Haven't you heard? 
Boy ain't nothin' but a white man's word
As the old saying go- I could never forget. Boy plays a tarzan g-tuck quit
So call me Shy with the Ooh la la la
Kissin' young girls and i makes them hollar
Fortan can never be an orphan. New Yorkin' Wu-slang talkin'
So hump the mile as I walk the mile
The little rascal's bucked un-juvenile. I be the captain of dappin' of
rappin'
How you scatchin' the cuts and the scratchin'
Not your average shorty 140 on the block
I got more props than your 1,000 cops
Stop! In the name of me. Like Denise Williams I gots to be free
To do what I want to do. Oh Shaboo
Here come the Little Rascals

Chorus:
One little two little three little rascals
Four little five little six little rascals
Seven little eight nine little rascals
Ten rugged rascals in all

Verse Two:

Gotta make a record to gain recognition, or competition
My posse is blitzin': I yell hooray! When they cross the barricade
Fuck the arcade- No games are being played
Sneaky little Shy from the streets of Staten
Somethin' shot me and my cousin cry Jason
Jason Jason- time for chasi' -girls
I'm on every case like Perry Mason
Step in they face and beg them for they number
Get the seven digits and now they like the roadrunner
Beep! Beep! Yo, things is gettin' deep. Takin' old does and coffee
There's no time to sleep. A tazmanian walkin' maniac
A young girl playing rap brainiac
So pump up the volume. For 10 balls you could have the whole album
Of the rugged- Child- Chi- Chi- Chi- Bow!!

That's a big bad motherfucka comin your way

[Intro: Shyheim (Pop Da Brown Hornet)]
One two one two one two one two
(Hey yo Shyheim wassup baby
There be a lot of shorties out here rockin the mic
For like one or two singles but they don't keep comin at em baby
You got to come non-stop like consecutive blows to the head dome
Gotta keep em movin non-stop, gotta keep em movin, that's all I got to tell 
you
Just keep em movin)

[Shyheim]
Hey yo what's goin on
Nowadays brothers keep testin me
Tryin to get me open and take out the best of me
They pull up rough, get snuffed, and then bust
When I kick that old underground funk stuff
That's comin atcha, better run from the rapture
Before I gat'cha I'm buckin shots atcha
Buck-buck-buck means you punks better duck
Kid you're outta luck, try to flip you get stuck
By the Wu-Tang sword, oh lord you shoulda bucked south
I'm spittin out on brothers straight from my mouth
You just been ripped now watch your blood drip
Right down your lip and then I'm ghost in my whip
Take a sip I'm the candyman, I got sweets
For all the sweet MCs that fake funk in the streets

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Gots to keep em movin baby)
Gotta move it over here
(Non-stop, non-stop like this)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo I said I wasn't gonna say no more but I got a little bit more to say)
Gotta move it over here
(Shyheim you gotta keep em movin baby gotta keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(They can't fuck with you)

[Shyheim]
Up comes a shorty, sneaky one
Armed with the loaded gun, shit's on lock til I'm done
Bad little bastard I'm a rugged child classic
How could you ask it when you know that I rips it
Check how the Shy flips his tongue like a pro
Fifteen years old with nuff skills to flow
Props, damn right kid, you know I got lots
If rockin hip-hop was a crime call the cops
Become a wanted man who was forced to be a fugitive
A shorty outta Shaolin Isle with somethin new to give
You want to hear it? It goes a little somethin like this
The Wu-Tang click is comin thick
If I must be the setter then I'ma have to set it
Forget it, that's your last buck don't even bet it
If it's rough then it's right and I'm never goin left
I'm not a comedy but my jams pack mad def
My napsack's full with mad goodies
My click keeps a low profile with black hoodies
You want to see me flop, well how can you figure
Cause bein rough and rugged's doin well for a nigga

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo move em over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo I don't care where you move em just keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(That's all I want you to do baby, hah)

[Shyheim]
Back in the flesh it's the want to get buckwild
From Staten Isle it's the return of the rugged child
I'm no pimp but I walk with a slick limp
And I catch a dunk off the funk like Shawn Kemp
I be the beat of the rugged rhyme freaker
To blow out your speaker, got more soul than sneakers
I swing the parties with the tunes that I hit, many bit
But then I zipped up that lip quick
I keep it smashed when they dash for my cash they get blast
And slapped on that ass real fast
I'm supposed to be the best when they flex
Don't get vexed, just put that mess right to rest
I'm an enemy cause my style is not public
Don't dub it cause my flow is masteredly rugged

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo when I hear this jam right here I know Shy is tellin me keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(That means if I gotta pull a biscuit out your head and tell you)
Gotta move it over here
(To get off the wall that's what I'ma tell ya)
Gotta move it over here
(Cause he's comin hardcore for ya, unh unh)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo like over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo, yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here

Shyheim,"Chorus 2X:
Napsack on my back
Napsack on my back
Napsack on my back
(I carry a full pack)

[Shyheim]
I rocks the blocks with the rugged hip-hop
And I can't be stopped cause my jam pumps like Reebok
Go get a grip as I flip the bic
Don't slip cause I rip shit and I'll packs a biscuit
So make em jump jump cause I gotta pump pump
I'll stick it in your gut and see who jumps up
So tell me now do you think you can hang
With the Wu (Wu) Tang (Tang) boom (boom) bang bang
Crunch that blast up the trunk of a punk
With the funk that gots em doin the drunken monk
On the Shaolin beatbox cause I rocks steady
Don't sweat me cause I get crazy like Eddie
Boom-bah, some say I am a superstar
Tell em all I am what I am baby paw
And my beats, fatter than fat, they're not funny
Cause these drums remind me of One's 4 Da Money
Now tell me that me and are can't drop hits
Then you heard it but then you tried to rhyme and got dissed
My style, my flow for real will have you chumped
And I get like Ziggy and toss it up

Chorus 4X

[Shyheim]
My styles is dope so call the kid dynamite
I writes the rhymes that's redder than bloodsight
A trail of thunder with rugged hardcore
When I rips the crowd the dancefloor gets sore
I laid down my game with my shade and razor cane
I laid down my game and parlayed with my gang
A little rascal was a bad little bastard
(So you're the rugged child) I see you're learnin fast kid
Get the message I rapped several texts
So don't even try to step to this with that old bullshit
On how you better me and how you could do me
Come on son, cause you know my style is groovy
To the max as I watch and give a beatin
And I got more bats in me than Michael Keaton

Chorus 4X

[Shyheim]
I'm kickin master Wu-Tang slang cause I'm a slinger
I got a magic grip so you could call me Golden Fingers
I'm rough and I'm tough but I keep it on profile
want to peep my style take a ride to the Isle
I'll meet you on the other side, we'll take ya dollar man
To prove to my fans that I really am the man
The hardcore shorty that will keep ya head boppin
And while I keep rockin your ears will start poppin
To that freaky flow and all that old good shit
And not to be conceited but hey, the shoe fits
Gimme room, I love to hear the next competition
So I can prepare to give another ass whippin
Short sneaky Shy-Shy the kid with the props
I'll make your heart stop at the pop of a glock
A Tech-9, an uzi, so what can you do me?
But take his advice be the next one to sweat me

Chorus 4X",Napsack,1994
Shyheim,"Nowadays you gotsta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin how to act
They always pull the glock when somebody rocks at night
And if they get shot they offer shit should the cops
Now tell me this ain't livin foul
She just had a baby child and she's back to sellin cracks valve's
On the Ave cause she's addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip don't want to listen cause she's in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck 
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then committed suicide

Chorus:

Hey Yo, this goes on it don't stop
Everybody's doin' their own thing
From hooker in the drug slang (repeat 2)

Times is gettin' hard, word is bond, I sware God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born tebba, A rebel without a pause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that want to be down
So they get a glock a lick shots to get props
And win shit rocks so you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by da homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live anotha day

Chorus

Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects 
Pulled his nuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggaz in hoodiez packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

Shyheim,"Chorus 7X: sample
Soon as the bass kick

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on 5c-75
Everyone's gonna be there I bet it be live
Ran home mad quick jumped in the tub real fast
Condition my hair, put on cologne at last
Iron my pants with my blue jean jacket
Put on socks black tops with a hat and three packets
Clipped my key to my pants, my dough in my right pocket
Fly lookin dip can't get even smoke a brain spark it
Take a bus now, I call up Newport cab
Pay up front says the driver cause he almost got stabbed
Pay my fee real quick, jumped out the cab real fast
Cut through the alley, oh shit I almost bust my ass
Ran up the stairs and just look what I see
Crazy dope cuties just starin at me
Put on my chump chain with my lucky go getter
They're whisperin and laughin ""Uh huh he's a winner""
Feelin dope, like I never did before
Umm, thought for a second and I stepped to the door
Knocked three times before someone had opened
They said ""Yo look at shorty yo he must've been smokin""
Shut the door on my face, the girls they say ""Don't worry""
I said ""Damn, I'm still ranked as a shorty""

Chorus 8X

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on are you with me
Before you pay your loot make sure it's not empty
Cause many people be schemin for a buck
Watch out, pray for luck that you won't get stuck
By a mob or a crew or a Clan but if it's one man
Let the shit hit the fan
Cause ain't no way in this world I'm playin pussy
Niggaz better try to kill and ambush me
Blow for blow, hit for hit money quit
Before I have to do some old wild crazy shit
So I take the live and put it with the raw
And score and draw mad blood from a whore
Then I burn an MC up like a burnt english muffin
Brothers always puffin in but ain't sayin nuthin
To a smooth brother Shy on the slippery script
For me to flip up and kick like a kung-fu flick
Polish MCs like Griff and offer up an alibi
High like Tone-Loc keep you horny like Spanish Fly
Clip up a whole new click with Mr. Clean
If that don't do it I get on the reverend Visine
And still come off on the top so you drop
Now I rock the parties non-stop
Hickory dickory tickle me - stop
Shyheim came to rock this spot
Hands in the air as you dance to this jam
In command hot damn the kid who slams
Up a party and steals like to star G
Used to body but now I'm pumpin hotties

[Prophet]
Well I'm that ill shitty kid
They call the Prof Nitty kid
I'm one motherfucking ill crazy inner city kid
(What!) Step the fuck back then relax
Rough is on a full scale attack black
Huh, I'm packing a full metal jacket
A bat, 21 guns and a hatchet
What's that? Some ill shit kid you can't match it
Don't even try to meet it cause you can't fucking catch it
(Aww fuck!) Baby you're shit outta luck
Cause I'm crazy, maybe it's best that you duck
Got the shit I can't hide, some call it animus
It burns deep inside and that's how I get heated
When I see the likes of you that's the only time I need it
Remember last meeting, I left my knuckles bleeding
Now my palms are bloody cause I'm counting blood money
That I rob from your man in the land of milk and honey
You can't do me none son when I smoke my Meth
I feel no pain, no death, so what the fuck is left
You see me meditate well then you see me in my home
Way deep inside my dome that's the place where I roam
Where knowledge and the wisdom, understanding of the lord
Is stored, if you're lured everybody grab your sword
If I live by the sword then I die by the sword
I'll die by the sword I swear to the fucking lord
Cause I'm taking niggas out like you never saw
See my sword is my tongue that's how I get the job done
I still grab my gun cause I'm a fucking rugged one

[Chorus: x2]
We came to rock (What)
We came to rip (What)
And with the rugged styles yo bust the way we flip it

[Shyheim]
Now here we go again another brother catching heart
Ain't that some shit I gotta rip him apart
Too many MC's fake funk claiming raw
You better hit floors soon as I declare war
Coming straight at cha, better run quick from a click
That's sick with a bunch of lunatics
For those who slept I want your rep want to bet
Today'll be your day of regret
Cause the Rugged Child is coming to town
To find a whole ground that can get beat down
Huh, how you like me now I get down for my crown
With a fat sound that shakes from the underground

[June Lova]
Bringing ruckus to a nigga, quick to pull the trigger real fast
Try to test me, buck buck buck on that ass
I don't fake none
When I pull out I'm down to take one's life
I'm trife so watch what you say son
Just came from up north catching flashbacks
Brothers doing that same old shit
I planned on chilling when I got home
But now it's like I'm all alone cause everybody's playing Al Capone
No one to stay positive with
Everybody's selling drugs and all that good shit
So I parlay on the forcing tip
The studio is where you'll find me just like back in 1990
But Joe, everywhere I go is like June how you been
Sorry I couldn't come to see you when you were in
Yeah, my man save all that bullshit
Cause if you really cared you wouldn'ta came to see a nigga quit
Word is bond, that's how I kicked it
No disrespect intended, don't get offended
I had to learn the hard way that there is no friends
How many of us have them
When shit gets real everybody's on the run
So niggas watch a back, here I come, here I come

[Chorus: x4]

[Quasi]
It was a cold day in hell when they all heard the word
Everybody's eyes swelled and all the heads turned
It went ""The ill killer and the shitty Prof Nitty
Was fucking blowing up spots all over the city""
And everybody cheered ""There a party over here!""
Trying to get our attention, but really need I mention
That my mind was set upon a most highest intention
For me to praise his name that's the reason why I came
That's the motherfucking name so don't ask the same question twice
Like who's the motherfucking real Christ
I already told ya once I'm too fucking nice
So I'll tell you again, it's Allah see who descend
From the root of David to the line of Solomon
All the way down to the motherfucking end so uhh
You and your friends just get on down
I ain't talking about dancing, face the fucking ground
Hands upon your head kid do as I said
Kid it's too late you're dead, good fucking riddance
And if I get bagged I'ma do the life sentence
So I'm out on a lam, don't tell 'em where I am
Even though I got the hearts and the smarts
To rip the shit to shambles
Just like the Huns and the vandals
Yo I'm the one more souped up than Campbells
Why? Cause I got the gats good and plenty
For the 1-2-2 you and the 120
So go and bring your crew if you want to get done
By the true and the Wu, cause here come the rugged onez

[Shyheim] (Down Low Recka)
Well okay if you say so I will be the man
But all I want to do is make my record just slam
I want to be the kid to make the real live single
To make the party people in the crowd shake and mingle

(Yeah well Shy you can do that with ease real simple)
True cause I'm the shorty from the Wu-Tang temple
But I can't sleep you get the girls and the cash
(Yeah yeah but you're the one that got the shorties in the smash)

Take one (take two) We comin through for your crew
(Who are you?) Talkin about you man (you can't Wu)
But you front, you all out punks on the hunt for some beats
To make your next LP complete

(Here we come) To make the crowd scream for the Clan
One by one (Takin out your crew cause we can
Get the gun) Better yet a knife what the heck
The job gets done (When we chop the head from the neck)

Since I'm short they have no other choice but to sleep underneath
The blow that be knockin out teeth
(I be the K, The Down Low Recka on the set I gets wreck
I make the calm sweat want to bet)

[Chorus]

[Down Low Recka]
So wassup better duck from my ill megablast
You move too fast and your ass is in the smash
The Down Low Recka, shit I rock full clip
In my glock gets hot so stay off my block

I come down hard on cornballs who sleep talk
'Cause you won't survive in New York
I flow a mad thick like the sap from a tree
I'm of the live brothers represents G.P.

I'm hot like the sun, find shade I got my rays on ya
Come near to raid my sphere and I'ma lay for ya
I see ya comin with attempts to Bougard
Peek-a-boo you ain't hard I pulled your whole card

I got flavor, you're damn right I gots style
Nine yards, nah the K goes the whole mile
Whoever said I wasn't ill with the skill
One minute I parlay, the next I'm all in your grill

[Shyheim] (Down Low Recka)
Back up, gimme some room so I can flip this
You touch this, come on, and get your style busted
You lay around and watch me break the mic stand
You should know by now that I am the man

Comin through, takin my place yeah you all know
That I can't be touched by a crew or any solo
Who dares to step to this kid and his Clan
(Aww damn) Another crew done by the hand

Of the Shy (What you do kid) I did him prop
(Where's the payphone) Hell yeah, somebody call the cops
When me and K grease somebody do somethin
Stop bluffin and frontin cause you ain't sayin nuthin

You're lyin, claimin that you rip shop up
You ain't heard it from me cause I ain't one to gossip

Pass it off I want to flip (I got the loaded clip)
Pass it off and move back (I'm reachin in my napsack)
Pass it off I want to flip (Let me show you how)
Pass it off then buck for Staten Isle

[Rubbabandz]
My style is mad funky, gots to show the funk
Don't need a girl who be traps like a ho
Which means I'm baggin bitches, my rhymes is gettin fatter
I dropped a lyrical bomb, why'all seem to scatter

You talk and chit chatter, it really don't matter
I'm too cold to hold and badder than the Mad Hatter
I'm a basketcase like the man with the chainsaw
Underground sounds that I rip from the core

The superfly, funktastic, never took a loss
'Cause I chose to burn competition like a torch
Got a short fuse, when I'm lit I'm outta touch
I take off, blow up just like a heat-seeking scud

Missile for bob-around suckas like a pistol
You beat me in a battle? Ha ha, now that's a riddle
I like to keep my style pumpin on the regular
I'm the man, takin calls like I'm on a cellular

I pack the rhymes like a tourist packs the luggage
On one hand I'm rough and on the other hand I'm rugged

[Chorus]

[K-Tez]
Pass it off to the right so I can flip kid
Shorty wildstyle, not for that old ill shit
Wu-Tang slang I'm puttin in your brain
You don't want it, they don't want it, niggaz don't want it

Don't flex boy because my shit is real
I'm sendin chills through your body like my man Evander Holyfield (oooh)
Everyday is get rough out in my town
That's Staple-town

Every other day a body's found, yo
Got mad stacks, don't even move kid I'm strapped
Tez got mad stacks inside his napsack
Here's a warning, I gets my meth and my forty and gets lifted
And fly in the sky like Mike Jordan

[Down Low Recka]
Now here we go, I'm back for mo' check the flow
Up from the Down Low as I wreck the show
'Cause niggaz is borin, ohh you got me yawnin
You come and go easy like a Sunday mornin

Pass the method, I want to get blunted
That's how I knew Wu-Tang slang was what you wanted
So I brung it, pass the mic, watch me tongue it
Now you done it
Tried to flip then you fronted

[Chorus]

[Shyheim]
Well I'm a bad little bastard how can you ask it
Many tried to flip and stick but got blasted
And dropkicked by a nigga that's mad sick and wicked
Got more skins than a click kid

A rebel that switch his level just like a devil
For those who rock heavy metal I bash you with a shovel
'Cause me and my boys make noise up and down the block
I rocks and rocks get hot and blow up the spot

'Cause my styles is buckwild and it shakes the ground
With a fat sound that funk like James Brown
I hope you listen cause I wasn't babblin no mission
A blank eye then run outta ammunition

On your ass real fast, no second thoughts you get blasted
So heed the words from the bad little bastard

Criminals, what up?

Get why?all weight up
No diggity, No doubt
G.P. Wu, Yo drop my shit right now

I gotta get my weight up
Fuck eight balls I'm flippin kilos
Did dirt so now I lay low from street foes
Broke niggas and bitches want to take what I got
Tell the jakes about my spots
They mad 'cause I make a lot
From Monday through Sunday I see about a million
Run with thugs that's down for killin, civilians
I'm thug related, pack nuff heat, they call me fire
Niggas fear my verbal technique 'cause I'm Kaiser
So say I represent the ghetto worldwide
Bust techs, puff lye

Fuck around and get lifted off this Earth
Take my word for what it's worth
I put that on the turf

I'm all out on my own, I'm goin out (dun)
I'm all out on my own, I'm goin out
(Like Patty LaBelle said I'm out on my own)

I'm all out on my own like Al Capone
'Cause niggas want my dome, so I pack a 4 lb. chrome
Stash it near my nuts in the front
But keep it in arm distance 'cause I'm gonna have to bust
The first victim that comes too close to me and shit
My clips packed up thick legit and victed
To go to war at any given time
I gotta protect me and mine
Before the damn flat line
I'm still young but I'm growin up mad fast
Treated like trash and dumped out on my ass
No one understands me but me
Nobody cares about how I feel but me
So what I gotta do is do for me
I wonder how that be goin all out for me
I got mad problems but I try to deal wit em
I wish that I could fight em
And shoot the fear one wit em
But the devil keeps on hawkin me
My soul he wantin G
But that shit I can't see

[Chorus: x2]

I had many dreams of being a star in the NBA
But they got thrown away when I saw them slingin yay
I put the ball down, picked the ounce up, then I read up
Now I'm 200 G's up and on my uptown
To meet up with these big druglords from Cuba
I don't trust em like a chickenhead so I'm bring the luger
And my 19-9-6 shot beamer
Flying on the West Side highway, that's when I seen her
Van full of jiggy
Oh now they want to get me
At full pushin 80 max while I'm hittin the buck 50
Niggas know Dig me blazin the la-la
The weed keep me zoned word to Taiwana
K-basa baby, you know who loves you girl
Young wild thugs we rule the world

Jiggers they stick close like crews
You never see me spendin cash rules on you fools
Cause I don't love you hoes (why not)
A lot of y'all cross be laws like Got
A nigga like me keep it real, word to Jesus
Respect to the real woman, fuck you skeezers

Chorus: (2x)
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
(Or do I gotta cock my pistol?)

I'm a juvenile deliquent, I keeps a cocked biscuit
Moet and Alize be gettin a nigga lifted
And when I'm high my mouth is dry
I'm not from the sky
But a nigga for the eye he better do or die
Clack-clack, that's all you hear up in the dark
Blaka-blaka, and then two bright sparks
The boy fall down while screamin police
WOOO jiggy comin, but them no worry me see
A criminal for bein crimi-nal
No matter who, what, how, when or where it goes down
A dramalord plus a punany don
In '95 I'ma max like Nissan
I'ma max, get it, max, I'ma, Max-ima, well come along
I take you through another Chamber, let me pick
36 Wu-Tang? Yeah that be that shit

Chorus

So I creep ooohhhhhh I roll deep like F.O.I.'s
Recognize or get paralyzed
I drop jewels like a nervous appraiser
A hell raiser, engrave my logo in your back player
I bring the pain in many different methods
Similar to the lethal injection and your style is seconds
What punk, boy I'll box ya up
Plus my rhymes is sicker than them kids in Somalia

Chorus",Can You Feel It,1996
Shyheim,"Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I'm working out in this world that you made G
Homicide rapes and robberies
When it happens in my neighbourhood police they look for me
I'm the prime suspect in the projects
I got this fucked up rep that keeps me behind a step
Always broke so I got this attitude
In my lab never fool my man, this is crazy rude
Gyros and pizza, be my lunch and dinner
I know that I'm a sinner, but God help me out nigga
I got problems that only death could solve
A high school drop out, and my GED won't get me no job
My family be calling me a loser
Moms she's a boozer, got me livin' life with no future
The only thing that keeps me strivin' is rhymin' and uhh
Bump 'n' grindin', besides that I feel like dying

Word to my peoples in the essence
I send my blessings
I know you gone, but it might be for the best
'Cause life is full of stress
And the projects you won't progress
God, fuck the world, it's a mess

[Chorus:] 
Pop Da Brown Hornet
Dear, God, as I look into the sky
I pray to you, and I, wonder why
I wonder why things be the way they are
So until then I pray for that it ends tomorrow

I'm in another world lookin' from the outside in
A corrupt planet, operating strictly off sin
You ask me will I miss this joint when I pass
The world can kiss my ass, I'm staring at the hour glass
Every day lived, is a step towards death
It's not 'til you're dead that your body's at rest
A funeral should be a celebration, everyone embracin'
This song'll be my dedication, unto
The Two Cent S, my cousin Duana, and Case
Rest in peace no one can ever take your place
The pain is eternal

No one to turn to when I sit and think about you
No longer in the physical, dealing with your spiritual essence
You're gone but we still feel your presence
Nothing can bring you back, black
Still and all it's just a fact that you gone
Dive I intox on the bar, a dagger in the heart
For every lifeforce that gets a brand new start
It's the harsh reality you're forced to deal with
Another family hit crawling in a endless pit
Of sorrow, no one's promised tomorrow

[Chorus x 2]

(It seems like the good times versus the bad times)
Yo I barely go to school 'cause crime be on my mind
Fuck local hits to leakers that's all in the past
And I'm livin' for the future, gotta make the great cash
(Slow down shorty, goodness come to those that wait
If you move too fast I might be going to your wake)
True indeed, but I got mouths to feed
Members of my family upstate in need for commisary
And if you stressin' me, gettin' the, best of me
So it seems like life is my worst enemy
(Don't let it get to you, Shy
Life is what you make it, you can't escape it
Play you like a bitch and just take it)

Hell no, 'cause when I'm goin', I'm goin' out with style
With two macs going to war with the other side of town
Ain't nuttin' sweet about me, Pop let them niggaz know
I'm countin' blood money, 'cause I'm a thug honey
I use the world as my zoo, I ain't no fuckin' dummy
I'm street smart, I tear a college grad apart
(I gets amped when I think about the slave camps
I feel the pain, use a Tec-9 to brake away the chain)
Yo calm down big fella everything gonna be aight
Go looki' for them blues you got a nigga want to do right
(Don't sweat it, just play the game of life at your best
Life is full of stress and in the projects you won't progress
Shy fuck the world it's a mess)
Yeah aight

[Shyheim]
Gunshots, they travel throughout my projects quickly,
I stay thuggin', for pray the god that none hits me,
me and my peoples we swarm in packs,
some rap others sell crack, to get stacks of the green paper,
we move makers, lex and landcruisers takers,
block vacators, thugs that run 5 acres of land
flooded with dealers who kill for grams,
it's the street life, baby you wouldn't understand nothing,
getting my hustle on, just 8 to 10,
but here I go again, cause recreation programs,
they makin' me no grands,
so much stress on my mind I can just kill a man

[2 x Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough]
[Shyheim]
I never knew my own dad when I was young he broke out,
that's when my mom got smoked out,
and I took the street route, I hung around with real gangstas
playas and hustlas, I guess they liked my style a lot,
so they took a little nigga under the wing,
eventually I started slingin' white shit,
no time for school 'cause the hours didn't mix,
so sleep late at night most nights I didn't even sleep,
that's how I got caught up, and sold a dime to the beast.
They offered me a 1 to 3, hahaa , I do a bullet,
traded in my gats for greens that's how the state do it,
I'm movin' ain't no joking get your muthafuckin' dosage,
so when you and the penal don't be acting like no biaaatch

I'm kinda anxious, I haven't seen my friends in a year,
my moms OD and when I think about it every seals,
but I'm a young man that gotta change his lifestyle,
get a job at compound, it ain't easy as it sounds,
I gotta have some fast money, flippin' burgers everyday,
I been to ? house, I get a slinky day,
anybody in my way I'm blasting, fuck the peace
'cause there's a war upon the streets, 
no south west or east, all my niggaz in the struggle

'cause my records predicted a future of Bill Clinton
But I continue to do my thang to make a livin
Fuck the police and Judge Brennan 'cause I ain't givin in
I'm cops so say the notorious killa
Last seen in the hilla in a black vigga
Smokin' lye with an unidentified man
The feds believe it was a member of the clan
A wild nigga so jiggy better be cautious
Fuck wit Delores I'm bringin 50 crime bosses
From BK to Jersey niggaz want to murder me
ain't nuttin sweet kid they bettah bring their whole army
Fake ass gangstaz pretend to be killaz
End the drama with a slug from the 4-5th for real uh

God dreams of livin large makin niggaz steal and rob
Fuck the pleadin Ill leave ya bleedin

Cracks on my moms china plate
Bag 'em up and wait till it gets late and hit the gate
Keep my eyes open 'cause po po they be keepin
They tryin to get locked on Friday and spend the weekend
Then on ruckus island adolescents be watchin
So when I'm in the four buildin I'm hollerin Staten Island
With my ? in my hand like a 4-5th
The first nigga to fake a move is gettin phillied with the quickness
I'm hip to this wild ass game called street life
It's a cut throat BI with mens who live trife
You Squig you my nigga (no doubt to the death)
I got the isle in my right hand so son part in the left
And let's go to war I got a tech and nine and 3 3-80's

[Verse One:]
It be the Scotch and Henessee that make me act like this
I'm wild hit em up project style never plead the fifth
Regardless, to the charges, chickenheads will be at court
Fightin and slicin each other to see who lies at my fort
Who woulda thought, little Shy Big Willie
Ninety-six we rollin dutches, nine-tray it was Phillies
First of the month be like Christmas to dealers
Hundred dollar seals come through the school zone area
Children at play keep the heat on the low
Little kids gettin hit, projects flooded with po'
Now shorty's rockin, Versace and Donna Karan
Playin the Miss Mob Queen role knowin hon the cousin Sharon
I live the glamarous life, girl
And go from limos to Dom Perignon, rich hotels

Stressed behind a cell with no way to escape it
Holdin on, true to ock steel tryin to appeal
Be landed without a bail so let the commisary reveal
I feel it's time, for me to let this sparkle in wine
Wet my throat rockin the trenchcoat, flashin to get mine
Not hesitant, 'cause the Henny keeps me bent
Just tryin to make a cent, diggin pockets down to the lint

Warrant after warrant, so I avoid the law

I'm havin suicidal thoughts cause I'm screwed up in the game
But today's thang, is to hold it down and maintain
I got thirty days until I get remanded for this gun charge
Still I'm livin large, joint hard up in the mode and
long sexin, fishin for pre-model
I'm young black rich and dangerous, livin like I won the lotto
So nuff of wine sex and dutches

Runnin from D's when they try to bust us

Raw, spell that backward that's war
Lay low scarecrow, I'm knockin at your front door
Pointin' a pistol to your peekhole, pussy
Warning, my trigga finga gets busy
Blaow, a single shot straight to the headpiece
Decrease the peace and watch the murders increase
See I'm ruthless, pistol whip a nigga toothless
Me gettin' hit that shit is ludacris
I'm on my P's and my Q's
Try to put your foot in my shoes kid, you gotta pay the fuckin' dues
I ain't the one to play Pammy
I leave the head all red like that little orphan Annie
I'm dressed in black like Streets of Harlem
Paddle punk's pockets down with no problem

But now I gotta act like I don't know 'em
The muthafuckers violated to the fullest degree
They did it smart, now they gotta see me
And I'ma flip like an acrobat, to give them bastards back
And let them know where my head is at
I pack a cannon, I know where them thugs be standin'
Near the stores, with them Hip Hop whores
And there I was all dipped and fatigued
Goin' Rambo, G.I. Joe of a dolo
Droppin' bodies, bodies they was droppin' 
Like rain from a blackman that went insane
They dissed my Earth I had to diss they whole universe
Blew up the block, stepped back and watched it burst
Niggaz was runnin', I was steady gunnin' em down
They hittin' the ground from the impact of the four pound
Some kids tried to dip in the whip, I emptied the clip 
And watched a car do a fuckin' flip
Reloaded at the same time the car exploded
Spotted a Gangsta Bitch, told her to hold it
It only took five secs for she squealed, ""Blaka, Blaka!""
Two shots to the twat, shit is real

Hopefully you're takin care of yourself out in the world
As for me, I'm mainting in this packed hell hole
Hopefully in the year 2000 Big Kane'll be home
My old school crew frontin on me cept for a few
It's a shame that jail had to make me feel the way I do
But it's all good, enough for me what's up wit you
You don't write or come and visit me like you used to
What's the problem huh Why all of a sudden you dissapearin
Now that I need you the most you actin like you don't care and
It hurts my feelins but life must continue
I heard that Big Mark died please don't say this shit is true
If so that's fucked up oh tell my niggaz what's up
And don't get caught up in no bullshit and get sicked up
How is my seeds doin I know they're crazy big by now
Tell 'em daddy loves 'em no matter what the fuck goes down
And Love Dark ha, he's a dead man walkin for talkin
To Jiggy Jake I'm puttin him in a coffin
Ay yo I'm vexed so Ima end this little letta
So take care of yourself for worst or for fuckin betta

You're one of the only things I got in this whole wide world

I'm in this little street doin by any means to eat
You gotta get up get out and rob suntin
Ha don't let dem niggaz with that cream walk by that's right

He told me to take 30 and bring him the rest back
It didn't take long for my clientele to swell
Snitches started to tell, broke niggas was jail
Cause they couldn't outhustle me so they tried to muscle me
But I ain't pussy y'all I leave em dead like a Kennedy
Took a half a year to get a half a brick
My own shit, now I make profit on every flip
No more hand-to-hands, I'm the big man now
Push a black Land Cruiser, pack a chrome trey-pound now
I'm smellin all the animos in the air
Pat spreadin rumors that he gonna take me outta here
What the fuck the bloodclot thinkin
My plan's to roll up in an old black Lincoln and leave him dead and stinkin
And I'm a man of my word, word
I seen him on the curb smokin herb
I made the Continental swerve
And hopped out and started lettin off shots
And didn't stop until I seen his body drop
Then a nigga like me just skated
I know he was packin steel, that made it drug-related
YouknowI'msayin

Chorus: (2x)
Things happen so keep your eyes open
Sheisty ones be scopin
That's why guns we be totin
Things happen so keep your eyes open
Sheisty ones be scopin

I'm on the run from po-po
Some crab niggas pulled the bitch move
My blood pressure's high but I play it calm and smooth
Everybody's my enemy, can't trust no one
The last time I trust a trust I almost got done
So keep your eyes open and beware of the ruckus
Cause life ain't nothin but thirsty, grity muthafuckers
I ran with niggas that will kill ya warm dead
Keep it real is who I pumped into them niggas little heads
My granddad, he used to call me Killer now I am
Everybody where I used to chill, fuck them
My mind was playin tricks on me shorty
Once I was like ""Turn yourself in and do the time"" (yo fuck that)
The pigs wanted five, tell my moms I love her
And stay strong and don't fall
I'm in the hands of the Lord

Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
KnowhatI'msayin son? 
Yo son 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done 
You the first man, you go first son 

I'm Mobb Deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be 
On some thug shit, runnin' wild through New York City 
Bustin' guns rockin' jew-els that shine like sun 
Stapleton is where I'm from 
And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
Will have my enemies, behind trees 
Niggaz that think they live 'cause they puff a little lye 
Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us

Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns 
You right about that kid 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know

The beat is sounding like Star Trek 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue 
So yo, youknowhatI'msayin son? 

Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon 
I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
I live by name and cut veins 
Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses

Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums 
From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
When I dine, the automatic weapon 
Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
Niggaz talk about they rollin deep up in here 
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair

Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 

Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace 
Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
We never play with commercialism 
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism 

My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
I'm packin' chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones 
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal

Bring my x-ray visions
See trough you, lace for day
Every bullet counts
And we don't bush straight
I leave you in your ways
Leave your shit, spittin'
Hollow heads in your head
Hollow head collision
I'm bad news,
extra, extra, read about me
Blowin', stolen,
Cops glockin' 197 lobby
My philosophy making niggas think they rockin' me
They can't possible!
I'm not a suspect, i'm far from that
And that uncontrolled substance
Like crack, cocaine
And Inspectah Deck
I don't know how you see it
But it clean ya specks
I'm too complex, what you say complex?
I leaved you stressed with a complex
You better stop playin' games
That's the advice I suggest

Chorus 2X:
I walk like I'm at war
Talk like I'm at war
Don't sleep like it ain't war
You speek like it ain't war
Better read the ""Art Of War""
Before crossing my lines
You better read the ""Art Of War""
Before crossing my lines

It ain't over till we even,
I even got the life support
Machines shook to keep you breavin
I'm beef increasing, bees season
You can peep my 8 by 10 photos
In the 1-20 prison
I'm runnin to your vision, squeezin
For no reason, make it so hot
Hot summer, Shyheim should be a season
Be the greatest like Ali Muhamed
We get a million youths to march
Trough New York like I live Muhamed
Predicted platinum, ya know should dimers

And ghetto richs to the extreme

Of the microphone vein
Now rushin trough your screams...

Yo, for the one-nine-nine-nine shit's goin' change
Now it's us in the Range, God's giving us brains
Play the game, put my heart into it, you stupid?
I'm a gunner, whenever I got the rock I'll shoot it 
The undisputed champion on the M-I-see
Been Wu-Tang before it became a production company
Stay fresh like Doug, I run with the thugs
That'll cut your throat and sell your blood
Fifty/fifty love around the border
Should be bidding five to fifteen
On the Strength for the way I manslaughter
Rock your girl's boat like the Titanic
Man, I got more numbers than the Ninex, plus the Bell Atlantic
More hoes than forty-deuce
More clothes than twenty cleptos could boost
I'm not having it
I bring it to your label, producer and your management
Man, I'm like the Feds, I bring down your establishment
Under the Rico, I purchased my 3rd quarterly from Bob Cito
Got your block locked like the Dred, Mike Z and Chino

A crime nigga, nine spitter, mind digga, refined

Blow off the surface like landmines in my pastime
I saw it all, had plenty broads
Cut your wig short like Demi Moore
Ghost, vanished, most motherfuckers don't know I'm half spanish
Hazardous lyrical tactics, pinned to the mattress like canvas
Get your ass kicked for talking backwards
Puffin Backwoods, walking through the back of the hood
No protection, Stapleton section
Corrupt life, T.M.F. arch style, we rush mic's
Disarmed for that gold-piece charm
Red alert, we all alarmed, ready for combat
No contact, counting backwards ten-to-one
Now let me launch that, no way you can catch my format
I'm like the Gingerbread Man, moving on land
Catch me if you can, I move faster than the average man

Leave you scarred today, mental washed away
I shoot like Hardaway, your body parts decay
Slow-lay, too busy lusting the Rol-ay, platinum face
I snatch you over-arms, I take you out of space
Take you into my orbit, Terrorist gone corporate
Chopping tracks into sawdust, son, so you could snort it
In the conference room, Terrorist Hymn coming soon
Album cover pitch-black like the sky, without the moon
To illuminate, in my dome-piece there lies a metal plate
Titanium, harder than a lock in your gate
Burglarize your enterprise and have fun with your mate
Cause I'm not nasty, when doing my dirt, won't see ya masta me
Silent Weapons is a classic like Freddy Bassey
What a word pro, electro, grenade logo
Forever show how I firmly handle the phono
Bitches lust me, my plans of wetting the seeds in the mo-mo

Sit back and visualize so our eyes could see

Mugs get scarred, thugs get barred
Treated like slaves in the yard
Playing the field, most niggas tell and squeal
That's why I move for 'self, only me and my steel
Cause shit is real and leary niggas will rat you out
Get under pressure by the jakes when they smack 'em out
Gat in they mouth, for talking, you sleep-walking
Can't play the street often, become a victim for extortion
For your fortune, your bank rose
Stank hoes, you think I ain't cold?
Run up in your crib, take everything, even the sink goes
You sweat like a pink rose
Can you smell it, when you soft like velvet?
Catch one up in your helmet, get dealt wit
On the quick-fast, take you on a great adventure like Six Flags
Spent every day of my life just trying to get cash
So when my shit blasts
Duck behind buildings for shelter, or you'll get hit fast
Catch whiplash, fucking wit Trife, you must've skipped class

With pretty feet smelling like Victoria Sec'
I could see her bra and panties were pink
Looking Spanish or Greek, finest thing I seen all week
Moving with her cousin and niece
I'm moving with my mans Monk and P
Stand at the wall, long chrome 3-3-3
Pussy for free like ODB, high off the eves
Bitches looking like Pamela Lee
Butt-naked on their hands and knees
Roll up the trees, burn somethin' 'fore we leave

And the ladies in the place want to know who we are
Gumah Oz Dubar, my hand all in her bra
So what's the deal ma'? Can me and my Clan Bar Mitzvah?
Call your girlfriends, after-party, house on the hill
Come and do real, she said ""I'm burning heart off the pill""
Drinks for free, I got my own VIP
Two or three, or it can be just you and me
Let's get it on and popping, crack-a-latin with no debating
No time for the faking, baby girl what's shaking?

Catch Monk in the midst of party cracking, don't dance
But I boogie to the beat low key, I stay splashed
And drunk still drinking, popping major with the ho's, I'm grooving
With this fat bitch, she stuck with my slang and my dress code
I got close, whispered ""What's up with the Bar Mitzvah?""
Then I grabbed her ass, she laughed with a porno look
And pussy popped her ass on rhythm with the beat
But passed, she with her man but her friends came two cars deep

We'd smoke a blunt, and build on shit was real growing up
Going through the same things, we seeing eye to eye
And no matter what happens, promised to let nothing die
So was born when he got bagged for 56 dimes
I'mma give his girl commissary money all the time
He caught this disease and couldn't stay out'ta jail
Locked up when his mom died, shit really got real
He came to the wake in handcuffs
Dear God, Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
His girl eight months pregnant, a nurse assistant holding him down
Faithfully on every visit, food packages, she bring him trees and everything

That's how we gon' do it, we gon' this real clever

That buck at bikers, get booked on Riker's
I'm the 21st Century Crisis, I'm a fighter
Flick up your lighters, for your nigga

And piss on rappers, like they C.O.'s on Riker's
Death arrive, the last face you'll ever see is Shy's
And my hand's wrapped around more necks than Armani ties
Came through in the M-5, tinted and kitted
The color of spinach, with Monica and Mya in it
I inspired, The Boy Is Mine Remix
And the begets on my wrists be the size of Cheez-It's
I've been gettin' it, ever since I could remember
That's why I post a million dollar bail like Baretta

Who got it on with the dogs, and every jail of my bid
Had a scalpal put up my ass, not on no faggot shit
Twenty one guns a year, that's what my average is
And I ain't gon' quit, until you get my enemies
The what? Out the whip, I'm the dude that they love to hate
Hate that they love, with too much street drama
To be in somebody's club, so I'm cautious
'cause I know shit that get funky, just like horse shit
Like I could be dead or in jail, by the morning
All everybody else'll be doing is talking
About the unfortunate, let a couple years fly by
Everybody forget, it's like you gone in the wind
You going to the pen, but y'all don't hear me though

You going to the pen, twenty years will make a friend

Flick up your lighters, flick up your lighters
I'm the 21st Century Crisis, and that means
Man, I'm bringing it back to New York
Staten Island, New York (put ten years on this beat)

[Shyheim]
I put a fifty in your mouth, out your ass for change
All you buckin' rap niggas, don't make me pull why'all strings
I write songs for gangstas, on the chain and can sing
A hundred rounds til the ding, I'ma die in the ring
Cause I'm a fighter, flick up your lighters
I got a bigger website than spiders, run with two five to lifers
That buck at biker's, get bucked on Riker's
I was shorty with the shitty diaper, sugar water made me hyper
Peter Piper picked peppers, but Shy fucked hoes
Put my gun in your face, like ""whoa""
Me and Black Rob, rob black, with the Tahoe
Cause he was gassed like Arco, beatin' him up PLO Style
I don't want to grow up, I'm a leaky leak kid
Got so many bags of dust, that I could play with
The Bobby, separate's my mind from my body
Stuck countin' my dirty money in project lobbies
Pockets full of drugs, tommy in my Tommy
Movin' like a zombie, off that bah bah bah shit
Welcome to Disney Land, I'm your host, Mickey
You down with PCP, you know me

[La the Darkman]
Yo, niggas call me a lot of shit, but they can't call me broke
I ain't pushin' trees, I'm pushin' E's of coke
With a cannon in my coat, hardly laugh, ain't a joke
Any foul confrontation, a nigga gon' get smoked
Might hit you with a gemstar razor, or a red dart laser
Take a piece of meat off you, when I blaze you
Like Albert Anastasia, I'm a mobster, I'm major
I'm loyal to my blood, not a fagot ass traitor
Big brother hustle great, I got to hustle greater
My operation's so smooth, they call me ice skater
With a mack ten, or eleven, cocked, the weather man
For super niggas, want to end up like Superman

[Shyheim]
I'm from the Island that's hotter than the Caribbean's
And that's how we Columbia necktie, law abiding citizens
Nine M&M's in the denim, is the minimum
Crack rocks bigger than M&M's, whiter than Eminem
Thousands, I quintuple them, like the Olympics signs
Red dot, yellow dot, green dot, all dimes
Black top, blue top, those go two for five
Get your money where you get it, don't scrutinize mines
Bitch, fuck you and them rhymes
I'm on the grind, to get rich or die trying
I done pushed enough time around niggas line
That get their bricks in New York, bad bitch in New York
Big chain, icy frost, roll some Porsche in New York

[La the Darkman]
I get energized from the vocals, though
You feel what I though, Troop, you feel what I'm sayin'
Cause when it come in like that
I feel what you sayin', now feel what I'm sayin'

[La the Darkman]
Let's go, La the Darkman, play the wind
Recently, I shot a nigga, that I called a friend
He was foe, tried to steal some of my blow
Oh well, snakes in the grass, I chopped the head off they ass
Need an instant replay, I make it happen so fast
Til then, I'm gettin' all this money, fuckin' all these bunnies
Laugh a little bit, but ain't a damn thing funny
You dig? I got kids, and brothers to feed
Not to mention, my life, my bitches and what I need
Three story condo, car and truck combo
Bang hammers on niggaz, like Africans on Congo's
That's how my song goes, drugs, money and murder
Check to see if you can handle it, before you take it further, it's La

Bring my x-ray visions
See trough you, lace for day
Every bullet counts
And we don't bush straight
I leave you in your ways
Leave your shit, spittin'
Hollow heads in your head
Hollow head collision
I'm bad news,
extra, extra, read about me
Blowin', stolen,
Cops glockin' 197 lobby
My philosophy making niggas think they rockin' me
They can't possible!
I'm not a suspect, i'm far from that
And that uncontrolled substance
Like crack, cocaine
And Inspectah Deck
I don't know how you see it
But it clean ya specks
I'm too complex, what you say complex?
I leaved you stressed with a complex
You better stop playin' games
That's the advice I suggest

Chorus 2X:
I walk like I'm at war
Talk like I'm at war
Don't sleep like it ain't war
You speek like it ain't war
Better read the ""Art Of War""
Before crossing my lines
You better read the ""Art Of War""
Before crossing my lines

It ain't over till we even,
I even got the life support
Machines shook to keep you breavin
I'm beef increasing, bees season
You can peep my 8 by 10 photos
In the 1-20 prison
I'm runnin to your vision, squeezin
For no reason, make it so hot
Hot summer, Shyheim should be a season
Be the greatest like Ali Muhamed
We get a million youths to march
Trough New York like I live Muhamed
Predicted platinum, ya know should dimers
27 can glamerish, we communists
And ghetto richs to the extreme
Devine put the money behind the dreams
Of the microphone vein
Now rushin trough your screams...

I'm writing, a letter
I'm writing, writing a letter to my loved ones

[Trae]
Dear Dinkie, more it what happened everytime I think about you
It's like the world been on my shoulders, everyday I been without you
My way of living ain't healthy, but I'm trying to be a man
I swear to God I'm fin to lose my cool, and people don't understand
Cause they be coming at me with drama, not knowing I'm going through it
I've been running from suicide, but they pushing me to do it
My nigga I'm telling you, I be needing you by my side
But when I see Danny Boo face, I be knowing I gotta ride
Deep inside it's tearing me up, since I'm praying it'll be ok
I mash the gas a hundred percent, till we together one day
You got a nephew on the way, I forgot to tell you the news
That mean just one more part of us, that'll give them hoes the blues
Our baby brother Jay'Ton, been doing his thang
And since he the youngest, you know mama won't hesitate to complain
And it's the same old thang, one day I'm coming to get you
As long as I'm in these streets, I promise they'll never forget you

[Hook - 2x]
[Trae]
What's happening baby girl, it's been a long time
You know I'ma rep you forever, with every word coming out this hard time
Lori, I'm never gon forget the day that you died
I couldn't cry, but all the pain inside was killing my pride
I had to be strong, for the sake of Dinkie in his cell
I knew he would lose it, missing you is what put him through hell
Your unborn child, didn't even get to see the day
I never understood why, the Lord'll let em come take you away
And I turned out how you wanted me to be, somebody special
Made the Lord bless you, now you don't have to deal with this pressure
On earth I really miss you, reminiscing bout how we use to be
I was your brother, you was my sister for L-I-F-E
My mission ain't over, till the day that I get the nigga that did it
Whether living or dead, somebody he close to fin to feel it
And I mean it, cause he took one of my loved ones
Now I'm losing focus, writing a letter to my loved one

[Hook - 2x]
[Trae]
Brenda what happened, Donnie we gotta keep the Lord first
The paining is burst, got me visualizing us living life in the worst
Way, I try to smile but it be hard sometimes
Knowing that you facing murder, due to the fact these niggas be out of line
I can't explain life, but still I understand
Everything happened for a reason, just part of becoming a man
And I can't tell you how I feel, when I heard that your mama passed
Knowing the last time you seen her, was in visitation through glass
Lord knows keyendation, ain't need to be in your life
So I'ma mash it to the fullest, and make sure they iight
And every night I'm on my knees, to ask the Lord to help you out
Inside my mind without a doubt, I know he bout to let you out
But don't you lose faith, cause faith is important at this time
And I'm your dog to the end, no matter what I'ma be around
South Klique forever, through the sunny and rainy weather
I love you my nigga, that's the reason I'm writing this letter

I left my gun home, here borrow mine
Pop the nine like a judge ""All rise""
This gun'll knock plants off tall guys
We value-packs, y'all small fries
Yo, I'm from the projects
Yo, but on the floor tied
Don't matter, we'll take up all size
Truly yours doc, then PPP hide, my name is 
Since five, I talk jive
In church dressed in cordoroy ties
Now I'm grown up and been married four times
Besides, I'm just a sight for soar eyes
Brick city, known pop the door wide
Stolen Bonneville in New York High

Reversin' the plot
Last come, first one to rot, first in the glot
If I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot
And I be the person to watch
If your girl missin' the rock, purse and a watch 
Hot as it gets, from Hell came outta you debts
Buy the cassette, rewind it to death
Alota y'all sweat it, you try to forget
How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz
I'm why you smell herb in the crib
Man I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful
Indo out-do, intro to outro

I'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique
Them niggas y'all look up to is on my dick
Sauce motherfuckin' born to hit
I get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit
Look, you against me is really nothin' to see
Who, when, where, what it's gon' be
I don't give a fuck if it's he or she
I'm the virgin of hip hop
Nobody fuckin' with me
I know your type, you a ride dick nigga
Cry sick nigga, lied quick nigga
Out of turn speakin', first one leakin'
Always the Suzuki side kick nigga
Bitches don't cast stones down, they throw bricks
Why I come through and tell 'em to blow dick
These nigga's the nicest?  No, go fish
Sauce, you da best motherfucker, no shit

You're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated
Observe it from over there, ok 
Ain't It obvious we overheated
You talkin' that slick shit 
But I jus' know that you meant me 
But evidently, you don't know
I get your ass gone permanently
It ain't complex
I'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next
Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up
And nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up
Look in my eyes, I'm not scared
Sucka, you heard what I said
If you don't wanna get dead
No it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla
The mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule

Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song
(Bitch nigga)
You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit
Zap nigga's like cellular flips and swell up your lips
Fuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house
Hey yo, before you empty your clip and pull at your trigger
Salute the legacy of these throroughly recognized niggas",Reverse,1999

Give her coke to stuff between her, said she loved my demeanor
Felonies and misdemeanors, I'm vilified
I just, rap on the side, black mafia ties
Prolific words, I speak for the unheard
Niggas who love guns, money, girls, and furs
Sittin' up in the mans', runnin' shit
On the phone moving bricks, orderin' hits
Perfected the game, diamond infested the chain
Niggas think I change I just want to watch 'em change
Livin' the American dream
Drugs, violence, sex, and loaded magazines
That's all I could talk about in these sixteen
'Cause that's all I live, ask Tibs
It is what is, either graveyards or consecutive life bids, shit

Raise the price and connect the dots
Through life's journeys, all I need is a couple of mack mils
A couple of mils and good attorneys
Skatin' on big blades, goin' out in a blaze in my last days
I'll probably die with a bad drug trade or an overdose
Without tellin' my moms, sorry it was close
My wife and my bitch fightin' over my notes

With that nigga, the P you double F
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
I kill niggas on the spot like a cop
I did it all four seasons suites to a cot
Give bitches nothing but breath mints and this cock
Call me what, there's a way to eat
And all we got is sports, entertainment or the streets
I'm in deep, think of Citibank when I sleep
Ching, ching like I was from Shaolin

Lookin at cha face just pure wit no makeup
A little bit of Mac lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the Coupe in hot pursuit
to stop and, introduce
Like I'm Shyne, and you? You my destiny
And you're diamond cluster, too much just to touch ya
Perfume, down to ya structure
Think I'll wait, until the second night to fuck ya
I want to marry you, nah I'm just playin
But we can start wit a few nights, out in Malibu
Surfin, be layin up on Persians
Here's my number; put in ya purse and call me

Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce

Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird

Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks 
Quarter styles over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh

We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Child's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Sean don
Just a bottle of Evian; see'mon, uh

Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa

Although some may change, girl you know I will never
I'ma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii

From cuttin' solid Purico to stack Fritos
went from grams to kilos
Mac in one hand, in the other hand grands and see-notes
game got my eyes wider than a 430 Buggy
no tellin' what the fuck I'll do for this money
stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
the thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
as I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
palmin' hammers
think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
takin' over with the Mafia
hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
the cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
confront frontin' niggas like ""You want it? well nigga, me too""
what the fuck, I'm callin' your bluff, niggas act like they stopped
makin' guns after they made yours
I'm sponsored by the NRA, DOA rules
grin and stand over your coffin like ""Hey you!""
tell the Devil I'm comin', keep it hot
for now I got my eyes on a billboard spot
don't stop.

take the stand, lie for it

I buy and sell bricks with my nigga P.D.
down with the team called B.B.E.
now if you want to join the team you know you must see me
buy ya can't talk to FEDS or dick R.I.D. 
It's a cold World baby boy, fuck it, I'm colder
Animals on my back keep my warm, my armor
Frank Lucas persona, warmin' coke up in the sauna
let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
infact it's drastic
a couple Million in the mattress
with a safe dick I say fuck taxes
rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
crime pays 
nigga, Nine-Hundred and Ninety-Nine ways
my destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
while my enemies smile, buried in style
Gucci suits and cufflings
sneakin' drugs through Heavens customs.

fuck the FEDS, 2 green and one red
Firm tight, hold the dice in this game of life
Aces suffice

Fallen Angels and Angel dust
my team do dirt to avoid layin' in the dust
Million dollar portraits in my fortress

Platinum cable, round table, so all the bosses know

I'll stop livin' the way I'm livin', probably not

I ain't never gonna stop

Been doin' this shit all my life
I'm a lost cause
And what about the rest?
Don't them suckers deserve a chance?

Somethin' better than a shoot-outs, liquor stores and food stamps?
Maybe if y'all teach them niggas a craft an' a trade
They wouldn't have to play that corner
Why'know what I mean? Servin' that yay

What the fuck, she think I'm stupid?
Don't know my ? blood is deeply rooted
Inherited, that be my heritage

This the place to be, where all the gangsters meet
As I pick up my drink, I see my man Fat Pete
But before I could walk over, two niggaz tapped him on the shoulder
And unloaded in his face, bullets flyin all over the place

Missed one but hit the other, in the abdomen, they both fled

Come have a meetin' with The Council
Bout the shit that's been goin down
Word is, same kid that killed Fat Pete shot Reg in the head
Bottom line he's out of control, he got to be dead
He's startin' to be a real problem
Extortin niggaz, Brooklyn through Harlem
But he fucked around and crossed the margin, touched one of ours
He got to go, he from your hood, handle it Poe
Say no mo', I'm out the do'
Went back to the spot to grab the guns
Semi-auto check, AK-40 check, shotgun check, revolver - that's perfect
Called Tiz and told him meet me in an hour
Bring the caravan, you know the plan
Ski-masks and stockings, seen him down the avenue boppin'
Him and a friend, just hopped in a Benz
Twenty inches on the rims, let's follow 'em slow, keep 'em in sight
Wait til he stop at a red light, then roll the window down
And kiss them bitches goodnight - they musta saw somethin'
Cause the Benz busted you and came at us firin' shots
I threw the revolver, grabbed the tec and left the driver's side wet
The Benz ran in a store window and got wrecked
I hopped out the van, ran up to the scene, still holdin' the tec
One nigga's body was split in half, the other nigga still movin'
Heard sirens comin' closer, as I'm bout to shoot him
But fuck it, I opened his mouth, and let the tec spray
And told him tell Satan I'm on my way die bitch",The Hit,2000

at Fifteen I sold my first bag of dope
used to stick Dominicans, burner under the coat
gettin' like 15 grams, a half a Ki
at Fifteen man, a nigga just glad to be
gettin' some shorts, me and my Man from a Hundred and Fifth
he knew some Dominican niggas that wanted a clique
to hold 'em down, shoot niggas in the head
throw 'em out windows if they were late with the bread
basically I'm enforcin'
around heavy coke, when nobody's lookin' I'd be dippin' in the portion
they wasn't missin' it
so I got my hustle on the side, flippin' it
sellin' like 500 bottles and Nicks, started minor
but I always knew I'd turn a big apple into cider.

Niggas...niggas just ain't built like me...
stand up niggas...since 15 
I been servin' fiends and loadin' magazines...
takin' shots..burnin' blocks..
this ain't no fuckin' rap.

[Verse 2]
Everything was everything 'till my Man got pinched
he had a shoot-out with the cops in front of the precinct
other than that, I went from enforcer to movin' product, straight white
powder now, gettin' it
the hardest nigga in the street
my first car was a 190 Benz with Louie Vaton seats
buyin' out the bar at the rooftop
I had a few spots
one called the jukebox
where I was gettin' like 50 a brick
2 or 3 bricks a day, makin' mothafuckas sick
my Cousin Ron a crook from the Brook was torchin'
any niggas whisperin' or talkin' 'bout extortion
shit was goin' right and only one better
when I got my Italian connect, hittin' me with pure Heroin
moved to 116th, started seein' real dinero then
empire buildin', the shit was takin' flight
had my bitches cuttin' up like 10 Ki's a night
mixin' lactose, Bonita, and Quenii
I was the first Black nigga with mafia ties
leased my soul to the Devil with the option to buy.

Yo..bangin' for real..
niggas is thinkin' rap, I'm thinkin' laundromat..
we washin' this money...
you think this shit is about rhymes...
you'll find yourself under the fuckin' ground...you know?..
we get low when the Feds is in town..
this is justice..
we playin' the pop charts and still lettin' them things pop off...

[Verse 3]
At 21 I was a legend, had the game transformed
controllin' manufacturin' and distribution of Heron
throughout the tri-state, high stakes
I spent Hundreds of Thou's out of paper bags
you couldn't name a car I ain't have
every minute new tags
Seven series to the Five-Sixty drop nigga
I was givin' away blocks nigga
fast cars, fast money, slow deaths
this things of ours 
had me doin' a hundred miles an hour 
through the City evadin' the Feds
started this shit called the counsel and we all made a pledge
not to fuck each others bitches
or touch each others riches
on top or broke 
never break this oath
every nigga in the counsel was a boss
we used to put coke on our dick and make bitches suck it off
it was alright 'till I got caught
charged with an Eight-Forty-Eight
behind Marion steel gates
niggas started shittin', actin' bizarre
drivin' my cars, fuckin' my broads, breakin' the laws
same niggas I took care of and got money wit' was on some funny shit
if I was different I'd snitch
what would you do if you got Millions with niggas and they had no love
for ya?
couldn't pay for ya lawyer
I figured shit, why sit in a cell to rot?
I'll be out in Ten, start over again
throw those boys in the pot, but I couldn't do it
you couldn't understand it of you ain't been through it
there's rules to this shit and I couldn't break 'em
death before dishonor 'till I meet Satan...I know he's waitin'. 

God forgive me...you've never seen a nigga like me in your life...
I'm what these lil' niggas rap about...
that's me they talkin' 'bout in they rhymes...
I did that time...I flipped that dime...
shoot-outs, jet planes, cocaine and automobiles...

I just want to move mad bricks
for all the days I never had shit
Now I'm young heartless and rich
Pistols and pussy, straight from the door
Brown paper bags full of blood money, need more
Too much ain't enough
High off dust, greed never endin
Catchin bodies I want Gotti was supposed to be
It's overwhelmin
Face smothered in cocaine, against all odds
Life is what you make it, well I made it
Leavin motherfuckers naked
I get excited watchin niggaz bleed helplessly
Put 'em out they misery, selflessly
A coward dies a thousand deaths
I got a thousand tecs
Takin niggaz with me when I got, fo'rilla
I'll probably be all pissu when I blow, fo'rilla
Adrenaline rushin blood bushin
It's nothin long as I'm bustin
All gangstas is dead, or in jail
except for me I posted bail, all hail

Money be the root of all evil, calico desert eagles
Bitch I'm comin to see you, all you niggas gon' die
Motherfucker die

Fast cars and plea bargains, pictchin niggaz wigs
Have they families donatin they fuckin organs
What you like, stress you up, press your luck
Better hope you hit seven or find yourself in heaven
Lost my conscience somewhere in between
watchin niggaz die and leavin the murder scene
Hot gun in my waist, stockin over my face
and I tell you niggaz this, I never miss, check it
My point of view is me or you
And I'ma burn anyway, what the fuck?  Bust
seventeen shots up in your guts, truck blood drippin
Dead on arrival, leavin my rivals
lookin up at the clouds
The prodigal son, seein demons and devils
through the reflection, of my watch bezel
Embezzle, and racket, full metal, jackets
Poppin heat and, seekin, niggaz die internal bleedin
Hear mom screamin, bury Shyne
Cause when I come, motherfuckers all die

who keep it real-a, chase paper fuck bitches they'll always be there
Burn blocks, bust your guns, rock your minks with flare
Live for the moment, fuck atonement
Explain to God when you see him
(?)lease a bigger day, til your paper reach the ceiling
Niggaz, we only live once
and I don't know about y'all, but shit I'm on mine
like Don Trump, Black Ted Turner, totin burners
Open dope spots on every block
Jumpin in and out of cherry drops
as the plot thickens, watch glistens
Feds trail us, surveil us, tell us
not enough evidence (?) us
Teflon, get knocked, put the bail up and get gone
In the name of Brooklyn Vietnam
And all you fuckin rappers, for the last time
The last name ain't Junior, my name is Shyne
Now take a paternity test, there's no relation
I'm the fuckin king, nobody stands adjacent

[Chorus]
All I want to do is get a brand new fifth
and a few ki's, spend some cheese
All I want to do is see my homies stay fly
until we all day, and spend some cheese
All I want to do is get this money washed
so I can lay back, and spend some cheese
Get right, live life, spend some cheese
G's ice, gun fights, spend some cheese

Bandana wrap, under my fitted hat
I got mines stacked, nigga where yo' ticket at?
Floatin countin the two turbo's
Bitches I burned know Shyne Poe; Bad Boy - who's fuckin with that?
I done burnt down New York, ran through D.C.
And this rap shit here, ain't nothin to me
Got my murder game down for real
Gave lead showers to any coward who sold me flour
Poe's my power - these rappers frontin like they uncut raw
I'll be the first to tell ya, they talcum powder
Actin like I know them, I owe them
til I blow them, and leave they face in they fuckin scrotum
One change on the pike, under the moonlight
Headin nowhere fast, Desert in the airbags
Death's around the corner so I make detour slide to the Rucker
Firelli's burnin rubbers
Pull up in front, let my shit bump
Hop out, no respect for the cops
Got the glock out, lookin for a knockout
Somethin to put a seed in, nah nigga
Just somethin I can put some ki's in, come on

Nigga wait, push rhymes, push fives
push wigs back, push weight
Runnin narcotics in over twenty-one states
Thuggin and buggin I'll crack your fuckin chestplates
It's good old America the great, the land of the G
Home of the slave
Where corrupt politicans and black gangsters is made
Where you die at 25, shot up in your Merced's
Ridin on blades, livin for today
Fuck peace, bustin at the police
Young black and just don't give a fuck
You'd think it was the Olympics the way niggaz be sprintin
and jumpin when my (?) bust, pullin up in bigger trucks

White gold smile, high profile
Bitches love the style
How the fur's fittin, gangster slur spittin

When gangstas rocked waves sold dope and sniffed lo'
There was a young G by the name of Shyne Poe
Puttin' it down, cuttin' it up and cookin' it now

It's been a lotta dick ridin' for lack of a betta words
For lack of a betta words
Speculations on the guns, I hold underneath my furs
Similarities in my voice, nigga, check the words

I'm in for winter to doe's that pinch merds from the cur
Dodgin' and dippin' the narcs
It's the young Frank Matthews, the rap version
Touch my trap on my smack the gats burstin'
That's certain leave ya face and ya chest and ya back jerkin'

Y'all got me fucked up like
My desert eagle and my sick doom bust right
Like my guns is racin', muthafucka, don't you know I
Make ya heart stop and ya body start shakin'
Now you know the bottom line of this rhyme crime
Twenty-five to life plus nine

Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Evil grin, dead eyes, walkin' wit a bock, monster
Best way to describe my posture
In this world of sin, I'm as wicked as they come
Moonlightin' as a rapper get this ticket and I'm done

Ain't enough money here, I ratha be in the tropics
Wit Corsicans where narcotics is the only topic
Persian rocks and things the man that made of snow
Tiger par and every other form of raw

Since a team been handlin', nigga been scramblin'
Bettin' on money in Vegas gamblin'
Desert in the abdomen, pissy drunk stylin', staggerin'
More than you can imaginin'

Thoughts randomin', runnin' through my mind
Like who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Shyne
Demented as a young'n, apple second comin'
Evil thoughts runnin' through my cerebellum

Shyne Poe, what the fuck you gon' tell 'em?
All you niggas that wanna be fly, my gun shots'll propel 'em
Leavin' somewhere smellin', repellin'
Closed caskets for you fuckin' bastards, c'mon

Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Only the strong survive and weak niggas bleed
And get found, wit they fuckin' face down
Numb from the waist down
I done been to hell and back twice and still in crack

Stare death in the eyes and never blink
Headshots rip through my mink
Went to war wit the realist killas
Killed friends over jealousy and envy

My heart's empty behind the wheel of my Bentley
Coked up, feelin' invincible
'Bout to take over the world, I can't be stopped
Not the feds or the fuckin' cops, not even seventeen shots

Can put a end to this terror
I'ma live forever 'cause gangstas don't break
We just get plastic surgery and relocate to anotha state
Or island, smilin', money pilin', wildin'
Yo Puff, over done them fuckin' violins

This shit is bigger than me though ask Oliver North
Kill you then use your corpse to transport horse
Leave ya brains hangin' from ya fuckin' car window
Any nigga snitch and givin' info

Since my motha stomach coke and liquor
Was the mixture
Betta be prepared when we hit ya

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch

A little bit of Mac lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin for a ring, I seen none

In a hard top something fronten
I must of (??) died, came back as a rapper
Scareface, smith and eights, in my life after
Bone crushers on my hip, cause shit get thick
In the myths, of killas tryin to get rich
I'm two shells from hell, you can tell I'm made for this life
District (??)
I don't give a fuck, cuase I'm'a do me
Till them hollow points, rip through me
I was born to die, live for what
Plush slut, bucks, guns and ?duffs?
Spent late nights in the kitchen, wishen
Watchin the pot boil, mixin, sniffin
Keepin America high, and why wouldn't I
Gangstas don't talk, we beat the case and walk

Goodbye's hard to say, cause ya moms to pray

Ima rep till I'm hard and gray, pardon me (may)
Ima make it hard today, bombs away
Lunach grenades, at your (??) and blaze
Calm ya rage, I ain't even on ya page

Hit tha door, kick the raw, spit that law, spits some more
Everybody hit tha floor, I'm quick to draw

Yeah listen

Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life 
I took in your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
Don't make me feel good to lie, even though you make me wanna cry
Hey, if you gonna tell anything, then you should have told everything
Instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated
So be it
We need to leave it alone

Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

Sittin' in my cell, heard about the burst
Wouldn't be alive, if I didn't bust first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray

Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So so Def

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions (if you got something to confess too right now, step to the mic, Twista)

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While having other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all, yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions 

Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""Man, don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

Way back, way back, way way back

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

And this by far is the hardest thing I think that I ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this","Confessions, Pt. 2 [Remix][*]",2004

Uh uh, Uh, Uh
Ayo, mac 10s and fake friends
Lawyers little game homicide 25 with the fucking nigga face 'em
But I'm still trill, still holdin
Rollin gully until I'm froze, close in a box with a bomb in fluid
Veins pumpin ice
First some 15 keep that king pumping right
Hard white, cold cash
Hold fast, fold fast, through the city so gas
No ass
Straight head bitch, I'm one a from the feds
Fuck comma raps, same G and canna
All I got in this world is my fifth dick and nana
Gangsta mannerism lyrical vandalism
Niggaz be burnin up their gums until the fucking hammers hit 'em
Who need help?
Well until then I'ma take that mac off the shelf
and hold the fucking street hostage
Blowing smoke out my nostril
Every breath is a step to a non-time in death

[Hook 2X]
I want to know where to go
Need a place in my mind I can rest
Cause this time is running out for my flesh
Dried up, sittin' in a chair fried up

[Verse 2]
You know me; I don't need no introduction in this
Big gun, big dick, half of a meal on the wrist
Sittin in my continental thinkin' about potential connects
I live in all, just pencil the best
Parts of the live of a quintessential hustler
When I pull a slide back
Motherfuckers be hoppin' their faces don't get left open
You understand?
Shirt soaking, brain smoking left in the ocean floatin'
Shyne Po, dough, stack, y'all Rap niggaz is trash
I don't give a fuck how much records you sold
Tryin' to be me
Keep it real dog, you'll die to be me
You want to know how it feel, don't you?
To have a murder charge, took gun to the American Music Awards
And live life against stars
Doing 170 screaming ""FUCK THE WORLD"" (gangsta get outta the car)

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3]
Where the fuck them niggaz at? We gonna handle this beef
Turn your mic off bitch; see me in the street
Fuck peace 'til I'm rest in the dried up flesh is finish
I don't know how to tell until I'm in the morgue
Dysfunctional, highly uncomfortable paranoid
Without the extra clip (bitch), try me I'll puncture you
Had niggaz waking up with wings in their backs, halos in their head like
""Ayo I'm dead""
Can a knight fucking princess Diana type
Vane wives, vane light, pen I write cold, hand of ice
They said too much for the motor mind to comprehend
Walk wit me, pause take a breath
Things ain't just the same for gangstas
Sleeping in diamond, it's fucking up the game for gangstas
While charges tryin to ring a gangsta
Through it all I maintain my gangsta

[Verse 1]
Ohh you rhyme witta slug and sum shots in his face
He rhyme witta slug tryna sound like ma$e
Listened to his tape, this lil' nigga used to sound like cake
Maybe I'm juss killin, maybe he juss snitchin
See a whole lot different when my sales ecliped
What I see is straight bug, straight thoro
Yea he be a killa, you kill wit bugs
Rather look at the facts not the hype
Like who got shot and who got knifed
Who keep gettin struck, but don't neva strike
Hope the beef go away but the feds indict
I know yo card nigga, it's so clear
You juss want to sell record you don't want warfare
You don't want to ride you want to get rich and hide
These niggaz would've died if they shot me nine times
Heyy it's juss for the best
Take this mob shit seriouse, please respect it

[Hook]
And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart
'cause it's a blood comin outta his slum
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ax me how I sleep at night
Pretty cold witta slug might heat me tight
Pray to god while I'm gone, is what underneath feels like
It's my work by the surf when they turn off the lights

[Verse 2]
You ain't kill humma 'cause if you did
Why you ain't get the pen after all of that hit
You know I know, that if you live
That shit that you spit, somebody got somebody
Somebody got jumped, somebody got cut
Yoo pac's a nigga, nobody got shot
Nobody got flushed, you screamin what what
Okay okay killa you'sa slut
Think about it, enoughs enoughs
I'm tryna show 'em whoes who
And what is what
I mean how can I respect you
When them niggaz that left you ain't none of 'em blessed you
( not nobody )
You know where they are, where they perform
Bust yo gun, stop makin songs
Please no more ghetto quran
You got money now it's time to bomb

Take this mob shit seriouse please respect it

And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart(2x)

Death of perfection as I move witout motion
Ain't no nigga in his game doin the shit that I'm quotin'
Take a good look 'cause you'll neva a see enought of me
Might be sum otha g's tryna trace n color me
But I believe in the ways of old
Slice these niggaz throat tryna tell on po
That shouldn't excist, fuckin snitch
Cut of his dick, put it on his lips
You really think I was gon' let you slide
Fuckin wit me you must be outcho mind
You really think jail was gon' make thinks right
nigga I will shoot you till you lose yo life
I was mindin' my own, word got back, niggaz talkin bout po

You got yo break come finish yo job
Juss don't get the feds involved
And I'mma reunite you wit yo moms
Rip
I guess this ain't juss music
'cause jail only made me much mo' ruthless (nigga)
And the bitch nigga knew this
That's why he tryed to sign me to g-unit
Tell 'em how you made me offers

Jumped on every street corner
Hurts yo heart that you don't get that honor
The feds I paid fo that
10 years up top
I sell 'em much shop
Both of ya was blood
Took the bus wit 'cause

What you, Uh yeah, Uh, Come on

Oh no, big Shyne Po
Back up in the motherfuckin heezy for sheezy
Gimme a tech that don't jam (bang bang)
I'm tryin to jucks some more grams and work this whole thing
My minds poisoned, corrupted and diseased
360 ki's
Money make the world spin
I make your chest smoke
Have your mother singing hymms
Particles of your brains up on your tims
Kiss you before I twist you
170 miles
Headed for disaster faster
I put it down right
Bustin off these rounds like
Real niggaz is kings
You ain't rockin' that crown right
Harder more PK watches
Topless, bitches in cars
Only meals could heal my scars

[Chorus]
Niggaz want to rhyme like shine like me
They supposed to
Niggaz want to bust their guns like me
They supposed to
Niggaz want to grind like crime like me
They supposed to
Niggaz want to mash like me, dash like me

[Repeat]

Allegations got me pacin'
Grand jury wouldn't understand my fury
For fast cars and jewelry
I could give a fuck if there's a heaven for a G
This is heaven for me
Go to trial never plea
Do a bullet and come home to the throne
I don't rhyme, I just talk about this life that's mine
I've seen niggaz die, in front of my eyes
Doin' my filth
Niggaz is expiring like milk
Different strokes for different folks
Just give me, different coke in different boats
Black Aristotle Onassis
All I see is crack addicts and automatics
You rap niggaz is faggots
y'all cannot be serious
I'm in coupes with gucci interiors
Airin' out your areas
Tech nines, two in the flex and shit
Lookin' at myself like
Yo, I'm the best in this

[Chorus x2]

Sometimes I really wonder
What's it all about?
How many bitches can I fuck until I get out
How many ki's can I cut, guns can I bust
Wigs can I push, spots can I juck
Every single one, 'cause I'm a fuckin' savage
Til I'm cremated, most hated, self made
Blood type G
All these young hustlers want to bubble like me
They supposed to
Sippin on syrup, until I perish
Pickin' bitches off the run-way
Look forward to, gun-play
Go to sleep with one eye shut
Wake up and do the same shit
I ain't never gonna change bitch
And that's the cycle
I don't want to be like Michael
More like Darrell Porter
Gettin' shipments at the border

Yeah, it's a wrappity wrap

P-O, nothing more to it
I'm gully, what, I've really been through it
From the stoupe to the coup and anything in between
I carry a sleet through me, niggaz live out they dreams
Throw the ones in the sky or up in the bing
I do it for them, when I'm crackin' them rims
See me doing solo, silver pot holes
Bustin' off Roscoe's, like fuck it, I'll buy a new set tomorrow
I'm the horror, the system belt
Suck liquor, out my mom's tits, instead of milk
I'm society's filth, shit, I feel no guilt
Well fear couldn't feed Po, what the fuck, I need mo'
Mo', mo', catch me posted up on one Pivot
By the looks of my arm and palm, it's been a blizzard
Bitches want to know, who that nigga Po
When you think of me, just think of snow
Call white, hard white, masterpiece, all white
It's alright, I could take you out tonight
And put you in some things
Have you lookin' like something, diamonds, buttons
It's the predicate felon, millionaire dollar rederick
Tellin', spittin' thesis, for my connections
Leave a nigga speechless, can't talk with a gun in your throat
Yeah, I'm loc'd, been around too much dope
All my life, brain ain't never been right
Don't hear shit, I air shit, niggaz lose sight
It's bigger than mics, come fuck with the kid
O.G.'s look at me, like that's how I live
Niggaz look from the sky, like, yeah I stay live
Resurrected through the necklace or the gold coated six
Gangsta never die, as long as I'm alive
And when I go, it's gon' be another Po

For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, everything that I do

When you see that coupe with no roof, it's for you

shit, sometimes man, a nigga be contemplating,
yo, living in fuckin' hell, nigga die, might be better.

[Verse 1]
walk through the shadow of death, my dick out pissing
rebel, laughing at the devil, homicidal threats
only if he knew, I want to lie a coal, who the fuck want to die old
on this miserable earth, forever, put me in dirt
it's better then living searchin treasure
that only brings atrocity, and treachery, baby mothers stressing me
ain't no hope left in me
live everyday like it's my last
waitin' to meet my niggaz that passed
at last I could meet Christ, ask him why the fuck you died on the cross
here these stupid motherfuckers, they still lost
I'll ask Malcolm, see what it was like to fight for civil rights
and nights he thought he would die, what did he do
did he grab his gun and a bust shot?
get on my knees praise Big and go fuck with Pac
find out did he really take 5 shots
ask him, who shot ya, was it the Feds?
couldn't of been Big Poppa, Brooklyn niggaz ain't braille
like that, ask Martin, why the fuck you ain't fight back

CHORUS(3X)
if you had a choice,life or death
what would you choose

if you had a choice

[Verse 2]
life ain't real its a dream we see tomorrow
reality, shit that's pain and sorrow
reality, disaster beat breaks,
a little girl up in the projects gettin raped
reality's a nigga gettin rock shot 41 times
and you askin why I run from one time
I don't even get justice,
nigga sometimes, no times, oh I'm bout to lose my mind
reality's fucked up, like a hard workin mother, losing her job
the battle of good and evil
like the devil, ain't losing for god, we on lucifer's squad
not knowing what the fuck it all mean
I can't even, get a can of sardines
niggaz driving bentley's, burning money, I'm yearnin money
taking your shit, I'm earning money
yet you call me a thief I call me a broke nigga trying to eat
on this earth suffering, why its like that
guess we the punished, blame Adam and Eve

CHORUS (3X)
if you had a choice

[Verse 3]
hold your latex, from nuns I take sex,
play chess, with the devil from the sky
like rain shells drop immune to this cold world's sorrow
beyond shell shock, can't you tell pop, I need some help ox
see them meadow officers watchin' myself rot
ice pick and cell blocks
hope the 12 stop on the highway to hell, switchin lanes
niggaz that know, what I mean to suffer and struggle in the gutter
slice birthday cakes with box cutters
I did not stutter, you heard me this is utter, reality
observe me, on a journey puttin niggaz on gurneys till I meet my maker
and I need my ama ? fuck Guiliani and Howard Seiffler

What the fuck, she think I'm stupid?
Don't know my pimp blood is deeply rooted
Inherited, that be my heritage

Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It's that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroin, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' ""there he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door

Shystie,"Why didn't you say this before, them times when I wanted more
Remember I moved too you but then you said you weren't sure
So we sat and spoke about this and agreed to stay friends
And now your saying that you want me when I'm moving out the ends

Look at my friends that you've been through
I've seen what you put them through
Your wrong, its kind of long,
I've now moved on, I can't get with you

Sorry to tarnish your plans
But you need to understand
That you had that chance to be my man
But didn't feel to take the stand

And now your telling me today
When tomorrow I'm moving away na, that's deep I can't stay
You need to know this, I ain't taking no notice
'cause I was raised not too let no man distort my focus

Thou my heart is sugar coated
Its sealed and still bolted
Hun I notice, how you move
So I could never be devoted
Don't risk what you got, 'cause you got too much to loose
'But I love you' na you just dazed and confused

Make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself

This whole scenario, just shows we weren't meant to be
'cause I love as my friend now, so it's best I leave
Look.. your out there studying your masters degree
While I like a thug that devises bank robberies

Ya see, Shystie's all about living life fast
Hopping in and out of cars, thugs repping it large
You can't change your ways, so just keep to your books
Because there's no such things as 'No half way crooks'

This is what I'm on, who I am, I ain't gona change
I'm about the street fame living in the fast lane
Let me make this brief, my ways get me into beef
So I need a man, that's on guard ready to roll deep

Use your logic don't go with your heart, I'm rough round the edges and dark
Yeah we got a deep past but it will never last
I'd rather past, you were right from the start,
Friends until the day we die, friends until we past

Make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself

Look, you need a relationship that's stable, I ain't really able
I know you got faith boo, but I'm far from a angel,
In my ends I'm labelled, my tag name will say it all
So I couldn't guarantee to you that I'd stay faithful

You need a girl that moves with a slow tempo
Appreciates the things you do and gets sentimental
I ain't the one to like, your not my hubby type
Don't throw away your life your playing with a game of dice

'I don't care what you say I wana be with you
I wana hold you down I've opened up my heart to you'
Right now I really don't care this situations not fair
In months to come I bet that you'll forget I even lived here

I'll be your blurred memory
I bet you won't even remember me
You'll be like what's that chicks name again
Like you ain't heard of me

So just keep your head and just hold it firm
And we can both take this as a lesson that we've learnt

[Verse One]
I grew up in H-town living life on the blocks
From then that's when I became unorthodox
I use to tie knots in ma socks
filled them with rocks And I'd swing your jaw if you gave bad looks

Now I, haven't changed still slightly deranged
Still slightly outraged and I feel insane
At way I contain so much pain
like a feen Life is real do you know what I mean?

Its like, ever since the days I was young
man was bussing full clips and the run of your tongue And
in my hood I see mans get worked
Then ah man would come back n say that man got murked

Yea, I can say that my live's been hard
Six of us lived in ah two bedroom yard
So I keep this in mind full well knowing I know where I've been
so I know where I'm going

[Chorus]
You don't know where I've been
You don know what I've been through
So how can you judge me?
You don't know about the life that I got
You don't know what its like to live in my slot.
this worlds gone mad and it don't seem right
every night I pray to god please turn out the light
that would be my one wish!
(that would be my one wish)
(that would be my one wish)
that would be my one wish

[Verse 2]
I got that H-A-see blood in me
I rep my east side I'm that ghetto gully mind chick
born in E5 And I've always moved
with mans ever since I was young
'cause these girls are too bitchy and their mind set is long

Yea I learnt how to move and stay wise on the street
'cause my older boy's showed me how a girl should roll deep
I saw moves get moved, watch man move what they move
To survive out here you got to do what you do

Hustling on the corner shotting work
'cause when your grinding you gota make shit work
'cause life is hard and life is real
And mans now ah days don't care when they kill

Boys young as sixteen
life's taken and gone and I sit back and sigh
what the fuck is going on This is wrong
to the families of lost ones I'm sorry R.I.P to babys Jessica and Holly

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse three]
The hood holds loyalty
the hood holds faith The hood holds struggle
and the hood holds rage
The hood holds haters that wana grudge me
But I don't watch you only god here can judge

So I don't care if you like me or hate
'cause lately a lot of heads wana vibe crazy
But I ain't here to make new friends
Shystie is jus here to make ah means to ah end

So, ima be the reason why you step up your pace in this race
Ima take every chicks fan base
And ima be the realist girl in the game
Ima be the reason people forget your name

'cause I'm big inner dis
big bad inner dis
And I don't care who likes me and whose pissed
'cause Shystie's here and I'm repping it for London
I'm never gona be ah pop Emcee, you must be dumb man

[HOST]
Hello welcome to the Nathan never show
Tonight we got many guess and exclusive videos
But first, we'd loved to get this woman between my sheets
Yeah you guessed it we got shystie in a hot seat

To be quiet honest I'm like sick to death with you
All these kids running around idolising you
From graffiti on trains too kids tattooing your name
What's next for heavens sake a shystie video game

Just kidding you're on the path to ultimate fame
Now can you explain how you got in involved this game?

[SHYSTIE]
First of all you need to watch your mouth and mind how you chat
Cause you're getting excited and best you relaxed
Bro, you got me confused like some closet Homo
But further more well discuss that shit after the show

Any way I made my name on this scene as a teen
And these broad page, pages that you seen that's just me
Because my PR you no ruth down there and sainted
She's blown me up now I ain't nothing to play with

[HOST]
Shy as you said this scene like male dominated
I mean you no some women get frustrated
It's hard to keep focus and self motivated
Results to women doing tings x rated
I'm mean you just got to keep control
I no a few stars that sold their soul
Even servicing there services on road
I mean shy I no you ain't no hoe

[SHYSTIE]
Listen yeah those question I ignore em 'cause I've got decorum
So I leave it to the girls who like whoring while I'm touring
Further more that question rude do you perceive me as some sket
Do I look like a girl that's who sleeps around to build a rep?

[CHORUS]

Question after question being asked
I don't know how long my patience's gona last
I am who I am so let me be who I be
I just want to spit man I don't need this grief

Question after question being asked
I don't know how long my patient going last
I am who I am so let me be who I be

I mean you got Will smith and jada Beck's and posh,
J-low and Ben aflet, 50 and vivica fox

ooh year not to for get jay z and beyonce
And there's rumours going round that you have a fiance

[SHYSTIE]
Listen yeah your talking like you no me you don't know me
Me and you ain't no friend's blood you're to nosey
All your question after question man its all bullshit
And I ain't going to fuel your fire towards it cha

Who I sleep with in between my sheets I keep discreet
I don't need my business talk about on the street

[HOST]
Look, I'm a strapping lad a masculine chap
I mean I play croquet but I can learn how to rap
Only last two minutes but believe I'm good in the sack
Sometimes I last a little longer but my woody clasped

I'm begging you please my marriage is like turned in to rubbles
Baby me and you could be the next celebrity couples

[SHYSTIE]
I can't stand when these interviewers don't pay attention
And not to mention you look like you're on a pension
You look like that ronald MC Donald and MC hammer
And by your heavy breathing I can tell you got no Stamina

You came on stage with your bow legged walk
Grey hairs on your head and that slur in your talk
From the start of your show I didn't take you serious
I don't even like you point blank and period

[CHORUS]
[REPEATED]

[HOST]
Its time for the audience to participate in the fun
Throwing question at you like a cricket ball that's been swung
It could be negative criticism that slips off the tongue
If I were you I would not be bother by none of these bums

Ok you first 'me ' no the guy with the thong in his head
You air head chop, chop time is ticking ahead

Ok hi em hello my name is Bernard yeah

No hi good bye ergh..

[AUDIENCE MEMBER 2]
Yeah I love your stuff; yeah it's rugged and ruff
I'm in to hip hop me, I'm in to will smith and puff
It must have been tuff, brought up in the ghetto and that
You must have had to sell crack to put clothes your back

Look don't stereo type me because I'm from the ghetto
I ain't buss no guns or drive by's so just settle
Shit what the fuck, what do you wana hear me say
Ok I'm armoured with live grenades and ak's

Your lyrical content is magnificent
Such emotion such conviction
Such intimacy, such addiction

Thanks to everybody that supporting me out here
Listen yea My album is dropping out of the end of the year
So, when it comes out go down to the stores and cop it
'cause you play a part of putting figures in Shy's pocket

[HOST]
That's enough of this fraf forgive me shy for all of this crap
It a commercial break soon, but I got one thing to add
I mean hmm, what's your actual chances of making it
This could be tumbling career that lasts one minute

Can you progress through this race to the very finish?
I mean all your competition can you handle it?

[SHYSTIE]
Competition you're joking mate that means I feel threaten
And there not no artist in this game that's got shy sweating
Na, I take the piss I tell it how it is right now
And 'cause I'm real, you see your fans, I'm here to take them right now

Ha Ha simple you feel me doe

[VERSE ONE]
Now imagine if this whole globe was run by jus women
Jeeze cor blimme what a world we would live in
Getting men all hung upon our love until they be sprung
Imagine men on page three posing nude in the sun

AND--- Imagine ladies pimping these guys
Getting them to sell there bodies on the streets at night
Think, we can choose a man then we treat them bad
Get what we want and need then we ditch them Lads---

Call them to attend to our needs
Get a web cam set up so my friends can see
Then make him pole dance on my bed post then expose him
And put his pictures on the net so everybody knows him

Imagine them with stush attitudes
Or the had a shy mood so we make the first move
But we use them for ah one night flex
Sayin don't get attached baby boy its just sex

[CHORUS]

Imagine the first prints on the moon was ah five
And all the world leaders had a trimmed bikini lines
Open your eyes visualise
Picture ah world run by ah female like shy

A female like WHO, a female like You and a female like I
A female like WHO, a female like You and a female like shy

Boys sit down, stand up girls, ladies we can run this world
Come on take a stand, we got the whole wide world in our hands [x2]

Now what if let these men live in kennels like dogs
And we only let them out to do the difficult jobs
Its deep, walk them on the streets and leads are on their necks
And I show him to my friends saying he's my new pet

AND--- think if we went Amsterdam
And the red light district was only full of man
Posing nude looking rude in the shop windows
This world feels like heaven Amen the lord know

Jesus come on guys please us
You're the birds and were the geezers
Imagine if guys took pride all the time
Before they had sex waxed there scrotum line

And girls walk around with moustache's and shit
Unshaven legs, unshaved pits
ERGHHH-- Yeah we crossed the line
But men do this shit all the time

[CHORUS]

[VERSE THREE]

Now I'm a males worst nightmare say your prayers

Hey we could run the whole of the see-I-A
Take over the streets like were G-I Jane

Imagine us on street patrol,
Woman having full control
No more labours, males give birth
And time of the month don't affect us---

So ladies stand up firm, (Firm)
Come on its our turn. (Turn)
To flip reverse this universe
Together woman we can run this earth

Yo, Medasyn star.
Plus the prodigal son, Zuz Rock.
Den, I will do. Yo.


See I'm a man who only chats realness
Be like most these kids who chat sh*t
S*ck record company dick.
Frost P, I keep it gutter.

Still bills I'm payin', still for meals I'm prayin'

In the meanwhile, I stayed me and wait,
They life ain't great,
But's better than the jobs from state,
For makin' it, mate, just a Q and A.

Still ghetto wit they mind of a needle
Quicker than a cheetah,
Draw nine millimeter up.
Grab a man's chain

If I get shifty, never in vain
Ain't life, but I stay in they game
Yeah the prodicial's the same
""Ain't we all a little ?""

Frame my brain to the game
Nigga blow the whistle (tweet)


[ZUZ ROCK]
Same issue, I move like a video on jerk.
Steady, walk forward in my Timberland boots
And I still ready to shoot, you need proof?

Show it any time
Fuck a label, I never get signed!
More time, niggas wanna leave me behind.
Tell me to put my name on they dotted line.

Ya find, the way I am contracts to they street
Come around, will you?
In the last two weeks, you're too weak.

I still represent Hays Town.
Though it's my proximity, my boy face down.
Murder mans, niggas fast like a greyhound
Quick to run in the bank, and tell ya lay down.

Style to the manner, got a place in the manor
Like a .38, always come back to the man-ner.
That's grammar.

Use it punk, big like they clumps.
You versus me equals my car trunk.

Lissen up, Zuz, Frost P, eyes frosty,
That Meda camp, kills MCs softly
Like Lauren, we buy shots from foreign.
And you don't wanna fuck with my side, fool

Yo, this is Shystie

Cause I know, see, I can spit,

Alright!

[SOV]
Yo, there's something, I got one bad habit,
When those streets step to me, I won't have it,
'Specially people like you and you an
That's okay, now when I come through

Come up they light's in they low power,
Remember they time when you got slaughtered,
Beef? cause no, it's just an argument
Words they is jerkin' in they House of Parliament.

With out they words, with out they verbs
Little boys left on they kerb.
People, lift them up before dey get hurt.
But their heart rate stop (beeep)
When they have just learned

That I'm above they flow
Leave yer mind in high-low
Like they center of a polo, push
Can't enter his height when I'm so low,
Yah, yeh don't know, so --

None a yer words can hurt me, fool.
None a yer combacks mean f*k, fool.
Nuffin' you say can hurt me, fool.
I feel bad, pity for you.

Rue the lack of sense.
That's yer ish-ing that does dis.
Where yer car? harhar! A domestic life

Devil promotion of sickness (hwack)
I'll spit this Anyone listenin' is a witness.
Helpless lady -- I never written dis.
Let's get on wid they quick busi-ness.
S.O.V. that darn lyricist can get us dis?
-- No.

Hup-two-three-four, I'm goin' to war,
To win and leave the runner-up sore. (ow!)
I'm raw, like uncooked meat,
That's why I'm in they hole,
That why I flak it, I'm a treat --

I'm deep. But my face looks sweet!
Sweet enough to fool yeh 'bout my greed.
Waltz it to where them don't sleep,
Yaeh, now creep!

[SHY/SOV CHORUS] [x2]
Yo, lissen up to Sovereign and me, Shystie!

Spittin' lyrics in your face, you can't keep up they pace
So you don't wanna fuck with our side, fool!


[SHYSTIE]
Ha! So, let's show these boys what time it is.

Shystie! Let's go!


Oi! 'ey, lissen up,
Don't get f*cked up I go through PMS,
My mood swings leave niggas in a state of
Distress.
I'm the lyrical Shakespeare thou shall never test
Doesn't spit about a rattle man's chest


Accordings to these angles, if dere was a circle
Yeah! -- play, boy, but I know my swivin' hurt you.


I take you for a joke, so you get laffed at (haha)
Yer a basic MC, boy. I'm done -- past it.

Cause my microphone sample is in they silence,
Leaving, yeh suddenly need stabilizers.
Yeah wanted to battle me like an idiot.
But I'll show everyone (sure!) here that yerr not
Ready yet.

I'll leave you body wrapped, body bagged, in a closed hearse.
Leff it in they church, can I really get worse?
Cannot rilly know that I jes silly caught, seen me

But I'm still here, cause I move like the wind.

Goin' to make havoc -- spit til I choke.
How could anyone ever better me for a joke.
See they tick-tock? on they body clock, I put it on stop.
If you wanna come and drop a lyric, there is no top.

But if you had it, you still couldn't rhyme
You still couldn't write (nah) in beat to dis time
So you never get close enough to me to attack.
You take two steps forward, but three steps back.


Cause I'm daily separatin' mens day out day in,
Leaving them with no self-esteem, meditating
And don't think of it, Unless its how I'll make you lose your confidence.
Even how you spittin on dis track is never-never lan'.


Your sh*t
You. can't. spit. and. it's. better. dat. you. quit.
Leave. it. to Shystie. that. spits. hot toxic.

But -- you member how we's doin' all?

Yo! This is it! heh hah haa!

Frost P! Bruce Grove N17. Z-U!
Let's take down these dudd birds. (nice)

Yo, I used both of these girls mouth
Like pick-up sex in a condom they beef is on.
And your Miss Dynamite
Impressions ain't botherin' no one.
So thanks but nah. Get yer own slogan!

Take that! Matter of fact, get off they track.
I'm too classy to go back-to-back
With your average hood-rats.

What you know about markin' yer game
Up yer walls? Nuffin.
Spittin crap at yer sympathizers. (nuffin!)

Treat yeh frauds like Kit-Kat
-- ""Give 'em a break!""
Cause yer unknown and fake,
Cause yer bound to hate.

Dey wanna beee like us!! (I know)
But they're featherweight,
And I'm a heavyweight.
Eatin' MCs like ready-break.

If that's the case, imagine what the skets get slapped.
Quick and exit. (huh huh)
And home it crept. Must be men!

'Cos you had the balls to steppin' into a rep
But you get blazed off they set.
Trust if you be Sovereign, I'm Benson and hedges
Don't to trust get me like anesthetics.
Even wif Gab's compressor, ya still sound lesser.
So don't get it twisted, girls -- you aint better.

Man, I take down your whole 'hood with my four wood.
You hear they way I flow, and you really wish you could.

Never dat! Too many rhymes, too many lines.
For the amateurs like you, I ain't got they time.

Heh heh.

They better f*kin' reco'nize what time it is,
Before we clean their clocks.
R-O-C? -- yep.

I spit sick rhymes, my styles
Better den yours, times ten.
I rhyme couple time, I punish you in line,
You could never take Zuz for a spin.

'Cos this isn't nevah-nevah
I'm tougher dan evah.
My vendetta is simply payback
Write lyrics with no pen, no paper.

Hate-ers never prosper. (yep)
So get lost like change down the sofa.

Garage doesn't matter to me.
'Cos if Shystie is on battlin' me
She's ready to see, R.O. is old school
Like bullet-hole jeans (whew)

-- when they bullet goes in
I used to shop work to get a gold fing.
For sure, I'm talkin', my fro's clean.
Yo, my 'fro's clean, just like the po sheets
Better listen up when R.O. speaks.

So all of my worrds are hurrrtin' you.
And yer both damn, sound like dudes.
Why would not you got a better fing to do?
Easily kill you hos, I won't lose. ZU-ZU!

In the MC game, I put a lame MC to shame.
You've only got yourself to blame.
Tame your voice when you talk big my sh*t is real
I kill your little kids like mornin'-after pills
-- So chill.

When you walked in, I met ends, it's not happenin'.
I still strappin' my nine, I still rappin' part time.
Lemme up, I take ye back they old ways.
Yeah don't wanna see me take it back to old days --

I favored Frost P like a maniac. (he's great)
'Cos I'm back, I show you where the f*ks izzat.

I'm still one of a kind, win they war with me?
Killed twenty-two (22.) MCs,
Them wanna make it twenty-three (23!).

Lissen up -- Zuz, Frost P, eyes frosty,
That Meda camp, kills MCs softly
Like Lauren, we buy shots from foreign.
And you don't wanna fuck with my side, fool


[SHYSTIE]
I'll slew you, hands tied behind my fat*ss
No lies, I will even close my eyes.
Turn aroun', with my back faced
In yer face, switch place.
Spit my lyrics in yer face like mace.

[SOV]
Yo, my eyes --------
I pity they fool who will sell it
Like dresser, uh huh.

Wot right about now (yo)
But can you do a little?

[FROST P]
Rose, never stoppin'.
I called they rolls, twenty years old.
I still hop on the bus with a child bus pass.
We ain't stoppin for queues we just rush past
Educated, but yep, I still bunk class!

[ZUZ ROCK]
See, I'm renegade. Roll wid they R.O.C.,
Plus, we fully stocked wid they nine milli

[SHYSTIE]
A lotta people know Shystie they renegade,
I keep gasses out they bottle, but it's not lemonade.
So -- don't get twisted, 'cos I'm not Shy.
Give a bad look, get a right hook in yer eye!

[FROST P]
Fat man that man I pull scares like anthrax
Leave a boy lookin, zip is lips wit' Tampax!
Wit my accent, jack all they lime off they track.
Make a used door sound like ""Oh dear, Maxwell""

[ZUZ ROCK]
Still --
Huffing and puffing and bluffing
And not on a double to nuttin'.
I doubled up when I f*d yer girlfriend,
Double the trouble, when I doubled they barrel,
R.O. dubbed it, so you won't be into lurin'

[SOV]
Yeah don't wanna look in my eye, fool!
My lyrics see people that cry, fool!
Yeah'll see black and white,
Like a black tie ball, so --

",De Colores,1986
Si Kahn,"When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys.
Everybody said I only did it to annoy
But I was gonna be an engineer.

Mamma said, ""Why can't you be a lady?
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl
Wait until you're older, dear
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl.

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow,
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk
Learn to coo, learn to moo
That's what you do to be a lady, now.

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read
History, geography and home economy
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need
To while away the extra time until the time to breed
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?
I says, ""I'm gonna be an engineer!""

""No, you only need to learn to be a lady
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world
An engineer could never have a baby
Remember, dear, that you're a girl""

She's smart, for a woman.
I wonder how she got that way?
You get no choice, you get no voice
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb.
That's how you come to be a lady, today.

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly
Working out the day and night so I could qualify
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh
Said, ""I've never had an engineer!""
""You owe it to the job to be a lady
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl""

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation
We were busy every night with loving recreation
I spent my days at work so he could get an education
And now he's an engineer!

He said: ""I know you'll always be a lady
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life
Could an engineer look after or obey me?
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!""

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them
""Your mother was an engineer!""
""You owe it to the kids to be a lady
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby
Remember you're a mother now!""

Every time I turn around there's something else to do
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two
Listening to Jimmy Young, it makes me want to spew
I was gonna be an engineer.

I only wish that I could be a lady
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's supposed to do
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me
Then I could be a person too.

What price for a woman?
You can buy her for a ring of gold,
To love and obey, without any pay,
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold.

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back.
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says ""We pay you as a lady,
You only got the job because I can't afford a man,
With you I keep the profits high as may be,
You're just a cheaper pair of hands.""

You got one fault, you're a woman
You're not worth the equal pay.
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart,
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain,

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool
And an underpaid engineer
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady
I'll fight them as an engineer!",I'm Gonna Be an Engineer,1986

Alive as you and me.
Says I ""But Joe, you're ten years dead""
""I never died"" said he,
""I never died"" said he.

""The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,
They shot you Joe"" says I.
""Takes more than guns to kill a man""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""

""In Salt Lake City, Joe,"" says I, 
Him standing by my bed, 
""They framed you on a murder charge,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead."" 

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes.
Says Joe ""What they can never kill
Went on to organize,
Went on to organize""

From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine and mill,
Where working men defend their rights,

Si Kahn,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord, Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord, Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord, Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""
Well, every Monday morning
When the bluebirds begin to sing.
You can hear John Henry a mile or more.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.
Lord, Lord.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.",John Henry,1986

You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1986
Si Kahn,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

Over sleepy garden walls

In the mist of a memory

Somewhere along the Rio Grande

I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

I've gone to ground
I'm watching porn
In my hotel dressing gown
Now I dream of you

I'm thinking back to the last day we had
Old moon fades into the new

I'm nearly with you

When I'm weak I draw strength from you
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
And when I'm down you breathe life over me
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny

I'll fly home to you
I 'm bending time getting back to you

So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?

While I'm sitting here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?

It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again

And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one
And if I'm four words then I am needing of your love.

And I love it 'cause that what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescued
So forget what the rest do
I'm blessed to do it with two of who are the best to do it

Raising a brow on the face of god right? Right now

No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in a crisis I might just know the ledge
But I love it like take away beer
And a sunset to lay away our day-to-day fears
See haters under rates us but this status takes years

Like the world won't revolve unless we're rolling on it
It holds them on it, it's soul melodic
And oh they want it and I love it

Everyday a new place, new faces and scene
Living out a suitcase few breaks in between
There's been very few days I'd loose faith in my team

Then all of a sudden I'm a volcanic eruption
Then all of a sudden it's like spontaneous combustion
And I'm all up in your face yellin', ""Bitch, you can't tell me nothin'""
'Cause I came from the bottom, now everybody's watchin'
I said it was my time, now I'm who everybody's glockin'
And I'm just out here sprintin', I'm runnin' right through my vision
I'm trying to outrun my past, but still trying to defeat my limits
'Cause you only get one moment in this life to be great
And you give it your all despite what it takes
And you never let 'em kill you, you take everything they give you
And throw it right fuckin' at 'em and tell 'em it doesn't build you
And no it don't ever break you, and no it can't overtake you
Life's like a bed of roses, you take the thorns and you make do
Sometimes you have to hurt for the 'cause to be reached
But one day you'll be stronger then all that you beat
And you can say

I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm born to destroy the fallacies, stop creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell 'em who they should follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty and death reserves for fulfillment
You the only person alive who holds the key to your healin'
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your suns hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain comes
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't material things in the world
That can change the fact that you feel lonely
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose the light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here and I know how you feel, so

All the love that's here tonight

It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
That anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say fuck everything, but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
'Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me ""go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything that you're about to""

Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

But I couldn't look down, but I couldn't look down

A million voices scream in my head
And I felt sure that I would give in
So why couldn't I now, why couldn't I now?

And by the design they shalt not kill
But when the noises overwhelm me
I feel sure that they will

Your whisper in the breeze
Your whisper's what I'm needing
Quiet bursts, so to hurt the whisperer

And though I struggle through the days now
It helps to know that you are listening
So I just wait it out
I'll wait this out, by the hour

And by the design they shalt not kill
But when the noises overwhelm me

Sia,"Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I’ve been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin’, it’s your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are

I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, (The time is here)
Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh
Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone
And to think I was gone

I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run

But when you lookin' in the Lower East Side
You're bound to find nothing but bad luck
Days can drift by, but I don't give a damn if you with me
Even if the earth exploded, I probably wouldn't notice

I'll wait a whole day for that Midas touch
Minus the fact she's the finest eyelids could open to my highness
I'd travel the world and back in hopes to glow with you
She’s the Patti Mayonnaise to my Doug Funnie
Every kiss is twenty four carats, no Bugs Bunny
I used to live wild (wild) she made me slow it down (down)
Who knows Maybe one day, we'll have a golden child
Haha, and that’s word to Eddie Murphy
I wouldn't trade places if you threatened to hurt me
Two peas in a pod that could never be open

From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)
May you always (always)
Be satisfied (rewind)

Rewind!
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I remember that

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said ""hi"" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame
This is not a game

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself

You're like me, I've never been satisfied

Is that right?

I have never been satisfied

My name's Angelica Schuyler

Alexander Hamilton

Where's your fam'ly from?

Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done
Just you wait, just you wait

So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? it's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give him a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is

Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! that doesn't mean I want him any less
(Doesn't mean I want him any less)
(Doesn't mean I want him any less)
(Doesn't mean I want him any less)

He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why
I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
(I will never be satisfied)
(I will never be satisfied)

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say ""I'm fine""
But she'd be lying

But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn't sized
Him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life

Something's happening inside me
Our senses come alive
The chemistry is building
It's something that we're feeling
There's nowhere you can hide

It's gonna get louder
We're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
I gotta reach higher
I wanna burn like a fire

Gotta move faster

A shadow in the night
Changes we're making for the better

There's nowhere you can hide

It's more than a feeling
We're building a dream that we've always had clear in our sights
Watch it ignite as we open our eye
It's the one way we know to survive
We're powerfully changing the world
We're reclaiming our unity
They can't divide
They push us around
