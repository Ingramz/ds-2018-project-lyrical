Wyclef Jean,"I'm a real nigga homie tote six figures only
Gotta pistol you don't want it boy you know what it is
I'm way flyer my pays way higher
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is
Ain't about drama you don't want no problems
I'll up that Llama boy you know what it is
I get money all I count is big money
Dick is all she get from me boy you know what it is
Ay ay ay ay ay, boy you know what it is

The wait is over here we go again I'm back in the play
I sell another couple mill and take it back to the A
I take another couple mill and put it back in the safe
Five cash for the crib on the back of the lake
I'm up in Crucial 2 stepping with the gat in the waist
T.I. ain't in the street no more fuck ho' dat what they say?
The men trying when you see 'em boy you have to be great
The pistol hit you in the face your teeth they have to replace
That's if you lucky nigga trust me it don't hurt me to take
A 100 thousands to them Haitians you'll be murdered today

I'm a real nigga homie tote six figures only
Gotta pistol you don't want it boy you know what it is
I'm way flyer my pays way higher
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is
Ain't about drama you don't want no problems
I'll up that Llama boy you know what it is
I get money all I count is big money
Dick is all she get from me boy you know what it is
Ay ay ay ay ay, boy you know what it is

Women sweating when they see me I'm apparently hot
Had the album of the year nigga Grammy or not
Remember all day I used to stand in the spot
With two revolvers in my pocket pitchin' handling rocks
But now chart topping in a car I ain't got
I am the number one customer at my own car lot
You want to know how much money I'm makin' just imagine a lot (10-20)
I'm probably making more than you'd imagine I got (30-40)
Listen closer I need to know if you understand me or not
Because you disrespecting me you and your man will be shot

I'm a real nigga homie tote six figures only
Gotta pistol you don't want it boy you know what it is
I'm way flyer my pays way higher
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is
Ain't about drama you don't want no problems
I'll up that Llama boy you know what it is
I get money all I count is big money
Dick is all she get from me boy you know what it is
Ay ay ay ay ay, boy you know what it is

Went from the king of the south to the king of the states
Riding in a car you probably never seen in the states
No idea how much yay' I can bring in the states
You can get a hundred on 'em four million a day
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million in a day
But it's an American gangsta right here in your face
And you don't want to see PSC in the scene with AK
You think you runnin' up and robbin' that ain't even the case
Just 'cause you get away that don't mean its OK
You a dead man walkin' and I mean it OK?

I'm a real nigga homie tote six figures only
Gotta pistol you don't want it boy you know what it is
I'm way flyer my pays way higher
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is
Ain't about drama you don't want no problems
I'll up that Llama boy you know what it is
I get money all I count is big money
Dick is all she get from me boy you know what it is
Ay ay ay ay ay, boy you know what it is",You Know What It Is,2007
Wyclef Jean,"You gotta get your swagger together, nigga, get your suitcase
Starts on the inside, ya dig, I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin?
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
Keep up, nigga, I love myself, you gon' need to travel, ladies
You go and get that Mack diesel, right

I'm the man from Atlanta to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried

What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week, bro
These niggaz can't keep up when they see me in London
So I go out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for

?Bout three days, maybe you'll see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
But my folk got that workin? like they back in the eighties
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me
Paparazzi, they be follow me, they all be
Hopin? that they get a shot of me

It's my swag, they wonder what's so special 'bout him?
Why they ain't sellin? records like him? Tell 'em
It's my swag, how he always look so cool?
And why everybody do what he do, so

Gotta be my swag, they wonder why he wear his hat like that?
When girls see him why they act like that? Aye, I don't know
It's my swag, for some reason all the real niggaz love him
Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him
I guess, gotta be my swag

Gettin? money in Frisco, wearin? my raincoat
See I'm gettin? wet and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'

I still can't complain? though as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but, shawty, ain't nothin? changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused, bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do, bro?

Send you to your maker then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin? on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you, boy, the Earth my turf if that hurts

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me
Paparazzi, they be follow me, they all be
Hopin? that they get a shot of me

It's my swag, they wonder what's so special 'bout him?
Why they ain't sellin? records like him? Tell 'em
It's my swag, how he always look so cool?

Gotta be my swag, they wonder why he wear his hat like that?
When girls see him why they act like that? Aye, I don't know
It's my swag, for some reason all the real niggaz love him
Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him
I guess, gotta be my swag

Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin? that paper, baby, however it come
I'm singin? a song and movin? yay by the ton
You never seen a nigga gettin? money so young

How I get from the pen all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland, skiing and pimpin?, goin? again
It ain't nothin? to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin? dro in Amsterdam

It ain't nothin? to fly all the way to Dubai
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'ma lie
I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me

This is impeccable pimpin?
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to, man
Ha, y'all, niggaz, keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico, my nigga, I'll be in Cuba

By the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti
By the time you get to Haiti I'll be way over in Africa, man
You know what I'm sayin?? South of France in my land, man
The Earth's my turf, my nigga

Wyclef Jean,"Ladies! Ladies! There comes a time in your life
When you gotta do somethings
That you never thought you would have to do

I ain't your superwoman, I ain't your wonder woman
I ain't gonna wash your clothes, I ain't the floor you're walking on
I'm gonna keep the car, stop caring where you are
Buy you own cigarettes, walk your own pets, I'm out the door

Wyclef Jean,"Dear Mr. President with all due respect
I wish we can have a conversation
I'll take a trip done to the residents
We can talk about the state of the nation
Mr. President
I will ask you about the war
Really and truly what is it for?
When an I-E-D mix soldier form dyeing for stuff above us all
Is it all about oil at end of the day?
Is the pledge of allegiance is something say?
I hope not cause I love The USA
In spite of all drama we have today
Mr. President are you aware
Our Flesh and blood is dying over there
When the coffins come back
Do you care?
When only the poor kids die
Is it fair?

If I can talk to the President
Would he pay attention really listen?
If talk something intelligent
Would he be willing to change his position?
Now it's Time time time
To speak my mind mind mind

Don't get me wrong
I respect the flag
But it hurts to see a kid in a body bag
He fought for his country with all he had
Now we have a family without a dad
Lil mama crying and the kids are scared
9/11 why we were unprepared
Mr. President,
Are you aware unless you're rich, you have poor health care
It makes you scream and want to pull out your hair
Discharged from the hospital soon as you get there.
Mr. President Truth or dare
Terrorist is hiding do you know where
Illegal immigrants is everywhere
Isn't really fought they want to come here
I respect you pleased be clear
Talk with me
Show people you care

If I can talk to the President
Would he pay attention really listen?
If talk something intelligent
Would he be willing to change his position?
Now it's Time time time
To speak my mind mind mind

What I'm to do
I can wait here with you
Tell me something that make sense
You sent off for war
Pleased be honesty what it's for
Doesn't matter is life or death
Yeah

I'm not republican or democratic
I'm independent I want the facts
When are the soldiers come back?
Are we prepared for a terrorist attack?
Late at night I watch CNN
It so bad I'm stop leaving
Middle East hates us
What's the reason?
Mr. President
My heart is bleeding
I tuck my kids end every evening
Try to teach them keep believe
Hoping my government want deceive them
Tell 'em Set some goals you can achieve them
Mr. President
I have to know if die for you
What will have to show?
How really truly how our country grow
Waiting for your answer Let me know

If I can talk to the President
Would he pay attention really listen?

Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day (welcome to my sunny day)

Block don't stop always stayed hot
No matter how the seasons got
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock den I got caught den I realized dat I had to stop
Den I took the time to explore a better way

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know, there's a sunny day

Give thanks for every blessing given to me
I know there's more to see, more to me, no more living in misery
Cause this is how I visioned life to be

Then snatched his chain

And the same place the eagle fly, down comes the pain
And the same girl that bring me joy, she bring me pain

Put a light in the air
From the hood to the stakes
It's so incredible
Fry your finger in the air

Wyclef up in here

If I could I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable

If I could I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind

I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to
But these tears got me searching for an inner tube
Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose
Don't wanna drown in my hurt 'cause it's critical
I pop champagne but still it's a damn pain

Beedee I love you my sister died but it never changed
My last love that we just ditched in my brain
Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name
The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain
Lord knows I wish death never had a name

Our last breath that it never had a relevate
Wyclef, Flo Rida here to tell it man
To the left, move, hurt for suffering
I lose myself when I think about my people's slain
If I could I'd rewind this whole thing

If I could I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable

If I could I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday

So I sit down and I had try
Are you living up in this life?
And I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind

If I could take yesterday and place it in my palms
I anticipate the day like a school prom
Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some
Big will I know heaven got the futon

Face good with the man paid your dues done
Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk
We had plans, plans change the new sun
The Lord never leave us lonely when you lose one

If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past
I wish life was TiVo and you could bring it back
I wish it all was remote and how the day be said

I were IP use it like it's pixel flap
Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times
Everyday be forever when I'm puttin' down
Showing off that's the truth nah

If I could I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable

If I could I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away
Wish I could go back to yesterday
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind

So I sit down and I had try
Are you living up in this life?
And I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind

If I had the gift be here I'd cure your mom from cancer
Take the Breena and stuck 'em up all with answers
Take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen
Have her graduate suma ku la day

But she so high that she's riding on drug assist
Growing up like the women from the exorcist
Her heart stopped in the ambulance

If I could I would pull it up and rewind
To the time when it was just me and you
Oh, how we were inseparable

If I could I'd pull it up and rewind
To the time before you went away

And still one time killing me softly

Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP 12, now, you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight

Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo

A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till when these women get the notion that they runnin' the game, huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then

Fillmoe, H.P. and Sunnydale, there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H. and Army Street, a different part of town
A different kind of freak, I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

More champagne, Mr. 4-Tay?

From day one, I had to get my money right
Me, Fly and Franky J we took a airplane flight, huh
They wanted to hear a rap, I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check

A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable

Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin' my paper chase
'cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop

So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin' 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas poppin' off at the lip

I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some Dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now, homie what you all about?

I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five, some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer

A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin' in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two Shoes, see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin' but a playa hater

I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts

So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?

You know they got one out there in Atlanta, the way they by choppin'

Wyclef Jean,"Falling from space, sometimes I feel out of place
Words we can't take back, if I could I would erase
Do whatever it take, to show you I appreciate
Before the angel tells me that it's too late

High noon the guns are drawn, it's a battle for love
Stand on the side as she watch it goes down
When it seems like the end, that's when it all begins
As she opens the door and lets me in

We’re on borrowed time
Clock keeps ticking
Days keep passing
Oh we can’t waste no time
These are the days of our lives
When we will fall
Just so we can rise
Just so we can rise

A Cinderella’s ball
Last call for alcohol
The saints marching in
While us sinners play the drums
When the shackles are broken
That’s when we all will run free
And we will no longer worship the beast

What once was built
I seen sadness destroy
But it make my faith stronger
I believe in the joy
And passion has kicked in
Like a thief in the night
And the touch feels like eternal life

We’re on borrowed time
Clock keeps ticking
Days keep passing
Oh we can’t waste no time

Just so we can rise
Just so we can rise

Uh huh, ice cube in my drink, it’s a good day
Seen a drive by turn in to a love parade
Battleships turns to the Love Boat
Refugees found our home that we’re looking for
No more robberies, everybody eat
Found the cure for the cancer
No more diseases
No bombs falling from the skyline
Peace, treaty, everybody co-sign
Colorblind, we all one people
One love, like a Mob Marley sequel
I’m sitting back listening to John Lennon
Imagined that it happened

We’re on borrowed time
Clock keeps ticking
Days keep passing
Oh we can’t waist no time

Just so we can rise
Just so we can rise

Martin Luther King basically alluded to the fact that all lives matter
Um, and so in January, he was tweeting ""All lives matter"" but in March
He realized how hard it was to tweet when you're handcuffed in the back of a police car

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

 correcting and perfecting his tune

one day he disappeared and the townsfolk cheered,

Wylie & the Wild West,"
Two men rode in from the south, a rainy autumn night
The Sky above and the mud below
They walked into the Deacon's bar, they were Mexican by sight
The sky above and the mud below
They threw a horsehair bridle down, we trade this for whiskey rounds
The Deacon slams a bottle down, the two men start to drinkin'

Their hair was long and black, tied up behind their ears 
Their faces were identical, like one man beside a mirror
Then someone whispered that beats all, their wanted posters on the wall
Twin brothers name of Sandoval, horse thieves from Boquillas

Now the bridle and the belts they wore were braided gray and black
The color of a roan horse once belonged to Deacon Black
The fastest horse for miles around, he'd been stolen from the old fairground
A month ago outside of town we tracked and never found him

Now the Deacon was a preacher who had fallen hard from grace
He owned the bar and a string of quarter horses that he'd race
Yea, Deacon he could drink and curse, though he still quoted sacred verse
He was sheriff, judge; he owned the hearse, a man you did not anger

The sky above, the mud below, the wind and rain, the sleet and snow
Two horse thieves from Mexico drinkin' hard and singin'

One brother he spoke English, Deac inquires as to their work
The man says mister we braid horsehair bridles, ropes and quirts
Yea, that fine bridle we did make, a roan horse killed by leg-bone break
He's horsehair rope now; horse-meat steak, we cleaned him to the bone

Well these gentlemen they were ignorant or didn't know just where they were
The Deacon's face grew darker as he measured every word
You horsehair braidin' sons o' witches stole my claim to earthly riches
Someone go and dig a ditch, there may well be a hangin'

One brother reached inside his shirt searching for his gun
Too late, for Deac had whipped around his sawed off Remington
The twins, they raised their hands and sneered, Deac was grinnin' ear to ear
He says court's in session, hear ye hear, yours truly is presidin'

Well the trial commenced and ended quick they didn't have a hope
Deac says we'll cut your hair now boys and you can braid yourselves a rope
The Old Testament, it says somewhere eye for eye and hair for hair
Covet not thy neighbors mare, I believe it's Revelations

Now the fancy horsehair bridle, it hangs on Deacon's wall
Next to that wanted poster of the brothers Sandoval
And he twisted rope so shiny black, the artifact that broke their necks
Their craftsmanship he did respect, they shoulda stuck to braidin'

Wyndbreakers,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

A lucky star's above but not for me

How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have because I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar signs are what's keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you

And I wish that I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this world had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
Well I'd come running back to you

But I've made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know
And I know that we can't live on dreams alone

When somebody cared long ago

And the difference I'd sooner not know

Life in two dollar rooms and cheap hotels
They mean less and less every day
So if I don't see tomorrow
Well, who's gonna care anyway

How it was and the way our love used to be
But the difference is that I'll always care

Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at all the good times they remember
And then I remembered the time
I can still see those bright lights back in Dallas

Oh Lord I run like I've never run before
Now they'll catch me and I know back to prison I must go
Not until I'll find the one that I love so
No not until I'll see the one that I love so

Straight to her house I go I must hurry I can't be slow
For there may not be the time to see my darling

The way she colored everything's so wrong
And then the chill came over me as I realized that she
Had colored things as she felt they belong

I was just a tourist out on the great white way
Where lights make night as bright as day and day as dark as night
I visited the city seen all the finer sights
Then I thought I'd do some slummin' for a little while one night
Well I stepped into the shadows of a second rate cafe
The burlesques were before me in their old familiar way
As I drew near my table the front girl whirled around
And I recognized my sweetheart from my own hometown
Yes she was just a hometown high school beauty queen
But everybody told her how she could be everything
When the contest finally ended and the judges called her name
She won a trip to Broadway where she would find the fame
I slowly turned around and stepped back into crowd
For I knew she mustn't seen me she always was too proud
And in that one lonely moment the truth my mind unveiled
The town she loved may failed her the town she thought she failed
So that night I wrote a letter on a homeward bound express
And it read congratulations to you on your success
But if you should ever decide to come back home again
Well you know I'll always be here waitin' just like I've always been
I was just a tourist out on the great white way
Where lights made night as bright as day and day as bright as night
When old friends ask about her I just smile at them and say
She's star of show on Broadway out on the great white way

Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all,
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'.

Well, I hitched up the wagon and I drove down the road,
With a two horse wagon and a four horse load,
Well I cracked my whip and the lead horse sprung,
And I said ""Goodbye"" to the wagon tongue.

[Chorus]

Well, if frogs had wings and snakes had hair,
And automobiles went flyin' thro' the air,
Well, if watermelons grew on a huckleberry vine,
We'd still have winter in the summer time.

Oh, I went out to milk and I didn't know how,
I milked an old goat instead of a cow,
A monkey sittin' there on a pile of straw,
A-winkin' his eyes at his mother-in-law.

[Chorus]

Well, I come to the river and I couldn't get across,
So I paid five dollars for an old blind horse,
Well, he wouldn't go ahead and he wouldn't stand still,
So he went up and down like an old saw mill.

Your unfaithful arms will be empty someday
And you'll reach for the love that you just threw away
Your unfaithful arms in time will grow cold
And the nights will be long you'll be all alone with no one to hold
Then when the darkness comes and you cry for the sun
You'll think it's the end but it's only begun
You can't turn back the years when you've lost all your charms
And you'll find this is true for I know that you have unfaithful arms
Yes when the darkness comes well you're gonna cry for the sun
And you'll think it's the end but it's only begun
They may call me a fool to take you back in my arms
But I'll always love you although I know that you have unfaithful arms
Yes I'll always love you though I know that you have unfaithful arms

We were so happy just being together
We dreamed of good fortune that would soon come our way
Though they were just dreams together we stayed
And then one day the long hours of dreaming came true
All of the hard work and disappointments were through
And I gave you everything but then I lost you

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel

Us kids running through it in our underwear

Stole one of mama's mason jars
Poked holes in the lid and made a firefly lamp

Cruising through the cosmos
Then love will be the rock that
Blows you from your sky

It can be explosive

Hide your emotion

I can put my trust in just one thing

And only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
Out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone
Only love

Peaceful waters, raging sea
It's all the same to me
I can close my eyes and still be free
When the waves come crashing down
And the thunder rolls around
I can feel my feet on solid ground

Straight up
And sideways

Straight up 
Is my way

But I've got good news
When you get down to nothing

Without your baby sister'
Two scoops of ice cream
On a summer afternoon
We ran wild
And all we ever wanted
Was to rule the world
Between our house and school

We move on
Put those dreams away
Thinking that we'll find them
Come some rainy day

First time I saw you
I knew I would love you
Half way through sophomore year
I finally asked your name
When I kissed you
I lost my heart completely
All we wanted
Was just to stay that way

We move on
Put those dreams away
Hoping that we'll find them
Come some rainy day
How could I know
That everything would change
Except the way I miss you
Come some rainy day

I'll sit and laugh with friends
At what we've all been through

He was my strongest weakness
I surrendered heart and soul
It's gonna be a long, long time 'til I regain control
I'm still a prisoner held captive by his memory
He was my strongest weakness and I'm afraid he'll always be
I gave my faithful hear to someone, I couldn't understand
How he held my little world in the palm of his hand

And he'd head downtown

Wynonna Judd,"I always go the other way
But my car drove me down today
To a little house on the older side of town
Back when things were never hard
I used to play there in that yard
And I just drove by to see if things had changed

Cokes were just a nickel then
And across the street at the Five and Ten
A lot of things were cheap and square and strange
And the life we had might have been
But it was one we loved believing in
And I just drove by to see if things had changed

I wondered now
If love is still the way it was back then
I need to know 
That life is still a place worth living in
There it is, just like it was
A house where there was always love
I just drove by to see if things had changed

In a world that's seen its better days
It's good to know some things remain
The same, though standing still is not time's way
Take to heart while in its spring
That love is just a fragile thing
I just drove by to see if things had changed",I Just Drove By,1993

That's the original paint job too
And look at it now, it's just like new

Elvis was happy, he felt pretty good
Here he was drivin' to Hollywood
Gassin' it up and pushin' it through
And look at it now, it's just like new
According to one of Elvis's friends
He took it up to a hundred and ten
He just wanted to see what his Caddy would do
And look at it now, it's just like new

And my, my what a beautiful machine
Oh boy, it rides just like a dream
Just think of all that it's been through
And look at it now, it's just like new

He drove it to Memphis come Christmas time
Weather so fair, the future so fine
Say, Mama them girls ain't as pretty as you
Look at her Daddy, she's just like new

And here everybody was thinkin' he's wild

Lord, it changed everything

Out on the wild blue
Yonder to dreams that rarely come true

From the island of green
I can put my trust in just one thing

And only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
Out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone
Only love

When the waves come crashing down
And the thunder rolls around
I can feel my feet on solid ground

And all we ever wanted 
Was to rule the world

And put those dreams away
Thinking that we'll find them 
Come some rainy day

I knew I would love you

I finally asked your name
And when I kissed you
I lost my heart completely

We play the same rules
In a heartbeat a wiseman can be a fool
There's no guarantee that love will be

A stranger or a friend
A prayer that's answered 
Or a heartache that never ends
Through the darkest hours 
When all is said and done
It has the power
You go from lonely to the lucky one

Love's funny that way
Now matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days
You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Not long ago I got to know the lonely side
Just me and my pain and nowhere to hide
It amazes me
How my world turned around
If it's meant to be
That's all that matters to me anyhow

Gotta lighten the load and let you go

And swore, death would be the only thing to keep us apart

We can't unmake love
And just erase all the years
The sweetest little girl
In all the world will still be here

We promised love would last
She's living proof, it still does
So even if we wanted to give up
We can't unmake love

Remember how the future looked as we'd lie awake and dream
Thinking just how powerful the love we made could be
And I can't help believing it's all still possible
But if coming to our senses is gonna take a miracle
She's right upstairs, right now, asleep

We can't unmake love
And just erase all the years

Take my hand and let forever begin

Just look inside my heart

To keep the magic goin' strong
Cause here in my arms
I've got your love

If you just take a chance, believe in me
It won't be long until you see 
What I've known all along

I promise from this moment on

I'll give you a love that never ends

Right now it's more than I can do

Oh baby, hold onto this moment with me
Show me how to start
I'll find my way but until then
If I'm slow to surrender
Try to remember

Kisses are sweet, passion strong
You make it feel so right
But there was a love that went so wrong
It's still here with me tonight

I don't get nervous when I'm out on my own
I've got that sixth sense; I just follow the stars
But wherever I am, I wonder where you are

I walk a tightrope; I follow my heart
Just like a compass whenever we're apart
I believe that love comes shining through
I'd fly through the storm to find my way to you

'Cause I'd be lost without you
I'd be slowly going crazy
You're the place I want to be
You're all I ever need 
I'd be lost 
Lost without you

I've got dreams that I'm chasing and places to go
But the further I wander; here's what I find
Wherever I am, it's you that's on my mind

For this miracle performed,
That through me would come a baby
Who would one day be my lord.
But right now he's just a baby
And the world is not so sure,
Cause while some bow down to worship
There are some who laugh and scorn.
But there's a will
And there's a purpose
That I know he must fulfill
And the reason why you chose me
Very soon will be revealed.
But for now can I just hold him
And keep him in my arms
And for now can I just hold him
And keep him safe from
Lord, I'll give him back to you

Little baby Jesus boy
He's divine in all your planning
But for me he's pride and joy.
But in him there is a story
That the prophets have foretold,
There is honor, there is glory
There's redemption for us all.

Never cross the open field for the one snake in the grass
But I'd rather risk my heart then never get the chance
To find my way, to find my way

I'll be in the mountains by morning light
Drive the road I traveled years ago
As a young girl leaving home

With dreams as big as the trees were tall

And you all know what happens when the bright lights call
You're either gonna make or you're gonna fall
Make it or you're gonna fall

But I've always known I'd come back home when I found my rainbows end
Rainmakers and heartbreakers could never change my plans

I'm goin' home where the stars shine bright in a mountain sky
That path above I've followed all of my life
It's guiding me back to where my dreams began
Then I'll be gone again
I'll be gone again

Filing down her nails with a emory board
Talking to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do

When she said, ""You see that guy in the baseball cap?
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that.""
Betty said, ""I've seen him at the hardware store.
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure.""

She smiled at him he just said ""Hi.""

He said, ""My name is Billy. I've seen you before.

Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?
Can I take you out on a Saturday night?""

He could see the answer shining in her eyes

Who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern arizona
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies
But he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladder
He knew the way in a small cafe, found the will

He met miss bonnie
And a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months latter
The feeling got strong enough
They didn't own a car
So it must have been love
That drove him uptown for a diamond
that's when he started goin?

See, it?s not for him
She is his only need

Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
A new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children
And my, how the time did fly
The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking
And billy watching bonnie's hair turn gray

And every once in a while you could see him get up
And he'd head downtown
'Cause he heard about something she wanted
And it just had to be found
didn't matter how simple or how much
It was love
And, boy, ain't that love just something
When it?s strong enough to keep a man goin' (repeat chorus)

Until we make a change
So far, we haven't done a thing
But sit back and complain
Let people tell us who we are
[Repeat 2X]
If we want to make it right
Then we've got to unify
Want to make a better life
Let me hear my people cry

I keep a watchful eye 
Over my baby brother
Responsibility
Every woman is a mother

When there's no father in the picture
It's likely he'll go astray, he'll go astray yeah
He'll chase his dream on the big silver screen
Or the court
Chances he'll make the team
A thousand to one
And after that 
There's no where to turn, nowhere to turn

[Chorus: ]

Poverty is where we grow
Videos are all we know
Get up, now drive away
Turn a trick, we let 'em hoes

The only way to make a dolla
Selling weed upon a corner
Killing future son's and daughter's lives
Violence and drugs and gangs
Models and magazines 
Having sex and pregnant teens
Is what we do, it ain't no thing
It's hard to spend our money
We should be making money
We spend it on Chinese food and the latest trends

[Chorus: ]

To succeed needs a healthy (?)
No man left behind
In spirit, he's your brother
You're not alone
If we stick together
Son of stormy weather
Baby keep your head up

To succeed needs a healthy (?)
No man left behind
In spirit, he's your brother
You're not alone
If we stick together
Son of stormy weather
Baby keep your head up
Let me hear my people cry

Let me hear my people cry
No, no, no, no

Want to hear you cry
Want to hear you cry
Want to hear you say I'm gonna make a change
Want to see you get up and do things
Want to to see you make a change
Want to see you help out your brother

Ah boy you’ll find a stretch, you’ll never leave me

When you woke me up and you give me the sweetest wind up

Even though your hurt was under surface and me ignored your signs girl

Limbered and teared up, can’t leave me like this

Loaded, good deeds
Your frown, my smile

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Have you heard the story about the boy who made a rocket?
He had all the things he needed, good friends and all the science
Gathered all his homies up to form a strong alliance
They're cool and noble men, they're honest, with hearts of lions
They worked together, piece-by-piece, to finish the project
He made it all work, boy's a genius, he kissed his loved ones
And they all climbed aboard it and strapped in
Born to go where no one's gone before
Will they know?

How far can we really go?
How far can we really go?
How do we go?
I'd surely like to know
How far can we really go?

There was no good, he needed a change, and thus he found it
A place called Earth, blue and green, it was their arrival
The plants, the trees, extraordinary things, great place for science
So overwhelmed by this, he cut off the people who loved him
His mind corrupted, boy transformed into a wizard
All alone, he thinks about the days
He was born to go where no one's gone before
And so he thought

How far can we really go?
How far can we really go?
How do we go?
I'd surely like to know
How far can we really go?

Ain't lost yet, so I gotta be a winner
Fingernails and a cigarette's a lousy dinner
Young, are you? Wo oo

C'mon meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare

How young are you?
How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eyes

How smart are you?
How smart are you?
How dumb am I?
Dumb am I

Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now I don't care, meet me tonight
If you would dare, I would dare
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare",I Will Dare,1985
