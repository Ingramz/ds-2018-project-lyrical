En la fiesta de brujos, los sacrificios son humanos
Ya saben que hacer soldados babosos
Traeme la cena o te hago caldo
Una sopa de sesos why sangre
Son mortales debiles - soy brujo poderoso
El rey Lucifer me manda a comer
Una sopa de sesos humanos
Diez brujos sentados con panzas ardiendo
Pa' el hambre satanica hay un remedio
Son mortales debiles - soy el brujo poderoso
Con drogas te traen - con machete caen
El padre obscuro me manda a comer
Sesos humanos
El alcalde, el presidente, el cardenal
Con huesos de gato why cabellos cristianos
Uas de judio why agua excusado
Sesos humanos why fruta de virgen
La hora de la cena ya esta aqui
Son mortales debiles - soy brujo poderoso
Ando harto de caldo maldito
La fuerza que tengo te va fregar
El machete te va chingar

[English translate: Human Brains (Sacrifice IV)]

I want addicts,children-robbers, your mother
In wizard's feasts, the sacrifices are human
Now you know what to do stupid soldiers
Bring me dinner or become broth
A soup of brains and blood
You are weak mortals - I am a powerful wizard
Lucifer the king commands me to eat
A soup of human brains
Ten wizards seated with eager bellies
For the satanic hunger there is a remedy
You are weak mortals - I am the powerful wizard
With drugs they bring you - with a machete you will fall
The dark priest orders me to eat
Human brains
The mayor, the president, the cardinal
With cat's bones and Christian hairs
Jew's nails and toilet water
Human brains and fruit of a virgin
Supper time is now here

You are weak mortals - I am a powerful witch
I am full of cursed broth
The power I have is going

Indios huevones los tienen colgando
Fila de bueys un chingo de largo
La bolsa de plata - lo tengo colgando
Madrota bruja - quanto nos cobra
""Lo mismo que siempre pendejo""
Diez para ustedes, viente para el gordo
Los soldados mas cargados
Quieren dos veces

Drug lords are not machines
El Brujo isn't a bastard
The city... natives
Whores for sale, good little girls
Young and firm

Bring a cum rag, a six-pack of beer
...natives have them hanging
Oxen in line for a long fuck
The sack of silver - I've got it hanging
...witch - How much for us?
""The same as for every asshole""
Ten for all of you, twenty for the fat one
The most loaded soldiers
Want it twice
I've got 'em hanging!

Don't hold back

Quando a saudade bater pra te derrubar
Pra quem vai correr?
Pra quem vai ligar?

Bruna Viola,"Quando eu digo que deixei de te amar
É porque eu te amo
Quando eu digo que não quero mais você
É porque eu te quero
Eu tenho medo de te dar meu coração
E confessar que eu estou em tuas mãos
Mas não posso imaginar
O que vai ser de mim
Se eu te perder um dia

Eu me afasto e me defendo de você
Mas depois me entrego
Faço tipo, falo coisas que eu não sou
Mas depois eu nego
Mas a verdade
É que eu sou louco por você
E tenho medo de pensar em te perder
Eu preciso aceitar que não dá mais
Pra separar as nossas vidas

E nessa loucura de dizer que não te quero
Vou negando as aparências
Disfarçando as evidências
Mas pra que viver fingindo
Se eu não posso enganar meu coração
Eu sei que te amo
Chega de mentiras
De negar o meu desejo
Eu te quero mais que tudo
Eu preciso do seu beijo
Eu entrego a minha vida
Pra você fazer o que quiser de mim
Só quero ouvir você dizer que sim

Diz que é verdade, que tem saudade
Que ainda você pensa muito em mim
Diz que é verdade, que tem saudade
Que ainda você quer viver pra mim",Evidências,2017

Brunning/Hall Sunflower Blues Band,"Once upon a time, everything I thought of 
Somehow seemed to rhyme 
The wise were always old 
And the young were always showed 
But very early on, I was spun a different hand 
Tried to get along, just by knowin right from wrong 

The best offer is a helping hand 
Everyone needs the promised land 
And whether you're young or old 
Never ever let yourself get put on hold 

I would sit on grandpa's knee..just to wear his hat 
And listen to the tales 
From his world of make believe.. 
As the child comes of age, leave him alone 
To turn the page 
 
Luck is the spine..a broken promise of another's mind
Straight goods really are what money cannot buy
Choose your side, and walk with pride 
There's no reward for suicide...",Once Upon a Time,2003

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Bruno & Marrone,"Me diz agora qual foi o preço
Que ele pagou pra levá-la de mim
O que é que ele tem que eu não tenho
Que lhe convenceu tão fácil assim

Mas amo tanto e não vou permitir
Estou preparado seja como for
Vou cobrir a proposta que ele te fez
Nesta briga não quero ser o perdedor

Se ele der carinho
Eu lhe dou ternura
Se ele der afeto
Eu lhe dou afeição
E se for dinheiro
Eu pago dobrado
Para não perder
O seu coração

Se ele lhe prender
Eu lhe dou liberdade
Se ele enxuga o pranto
Eu lhe tiro a dor
Já estou disposto a lhe dar minha vida
Para não perder essa guerra de amor

Resolvi partir porque é impossível
Haver um romance formado por três
Seria esquisito você me dizendo
Agora querido chegou sua vez

Receber os beijos tão divididos
Entre dois amantes
Estar com você no mesmo instante
Pensar que um outro tudo lhe fez

Não, querida, não, amor a três
Assim não consigo
Já estou sabendo
Que pensa em outro estando comigo

Uma mulher e dois homens
É impossível, adeus querida
Eu vou partir nesta hora
Fique com ele agora
Viver em três não é vida

Se eu pudesse te contar
Como eu sofro noite e dia
Se eu soubesse onde estás
Ao teu lado eu voltaria

Faz um ano que eu padeço de saudades

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.

Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.
 
And if by chance that special place that you've been dreaming of
Lead you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",The Greatest Love of All,2006

Parlez-moi d'amour,
Redites-moi des choses tendres,
Votre beau discours,
Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre.
Pourvu que toujours
Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes :
Je vous aime.

Vous savez bien
Que dans le fond, je n'en crois rien,
Mais cependant je veux encore,
Ecouter ce mot que j'adore,
Votre voix aux sons caressants,
Qui le murmure en frémissant,
Me berce de sa belle histoire,
Et malgré moi je veux y croire.

Il est si doux
Mon cher trésor, d'être un peu fou,
La vie est parfois trop amère,
Si l'on ne croit pas aux chimères,

Et le console d'un baiser,
Du coeur on guérit la blessure,
Par un serment qui le rassure.

Bruno Edjenguele,"I drew a picture
And that picture was of you
A combination of rythmes
And that song was for you
I saw a movie
The story was like ours
And next to my bed
Is were I keep you dead flowers
There's not a dream
Where you're not involved
But by the time I wake up
Your face has dissolved
The time will come
When this will be history
Left in my mind
As an unsolved mystery
I do have a job
A few friends and occupations
But I consider them more
As social obligations
I'm eating well
About three times a day
And if I were religious
I swear I would pray

I'm trying to focus on all
The nonsense I do
But like obsessed
All I can see is you
The time will come
When this will be history
Left in my mind
As an unsolved mystery
Days gone by, but what is different
What has changed?
You promised me
That time would get things arranged
Perhaps you've forgetten me
Just like you were supposed to do
But I'm still singing my song
And looking at the picture I drew
I still dream
And you keep being involved
But by the time I wake up
Your face has dissolved
The time must come
When this will be history
Left in my mind

I've made it on my own!

Quell'espressione un po'così
Che abbiamo noi prima d'andare a Genova

E ogni volta ci chiediamo
Se quel posto dove andiamo
Non c'inghiotte, e non torniamo più

Eppur parenti siamo in po'
Di quella gente che c'è lì
Che come noi è forse un po' selvatica ma
La paura che ci fa quel mare scuro
E che si muovo anche di notte
Non sta fermo mai

Genova per noi
Che stiamo in fondo alla campagna
E abbiamo il sole in piazza rare volte
E il resto è pioggia che ci bagna
Genova, dicevo, e un'idea come un'altra

Ma quella faccia un po'così
Quell'espressione un po'così
Che abbiamo noi

Mentre guardiamo Genova
Ed ogni volta l'annusiamo
E circospetti ci muoviamo
Un po'randagi ci sentiamo noi

Macaia, scimmia di luce e di follia
Foschia, pesci, Africa, sonno, nausea, fantasia
E intanto, nell'ombra dei loro armadi
Tengono lini, e vecchie lavande

Lasciaci, tornare ai nostri temporali
Genova, ha I giorni tutti uguali

In un'immobile campagna
Con la pioggia che ci bagna
E i gamberoni rossi sono un sogno
E il sole è un lampo giallo al parabrise

Con quella faccia un po'così
Quell'espressione un po'così
Che abbiamo noi
Che abbiamo visto Genova

Bruno Leone,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Léa un secret
qu'elle ne peut pas dire
Léa des regrets
qu'elle ne peut pas fuir
Léa du chagrin
et des devoirs à faire pour demain
Léa mon coeur entre ses mains

Bruno Mars,"This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em' skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with five nine
But I feel like I'm six eight

This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron
To going and buying four or five of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr.Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in twenty years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight, but tonight we're alright
So hold up your light, let it shine 'cause

This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see

Uh, uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with you bitch smokin’ grade A

You know what? It’s like I’m seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I’m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you re all alone

I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise 
I'm looking out for love however it may seem 
I never do return in the always winning team 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away 
Until another day 

Another crack in my heart, 
Another picture on the wall 
Another way to spend an evening 
When there's no one there at all 
Another kiss to say goodbye, 
Another cross upon a chart 
Another suitcase at the door 
Another crack in my heart 
In my heart 

I had my spills and thrills of love 
And held it in my hand 
I held on tight until it broke 
And I crashed to the ground 
Love cannot be on my side 
It's clearer every dull 
That every time I reach for love 
It always runs away 

Maybe I should try to live alone, 
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown 
Maybe I should run and hide away

Ça sent le mal qui s'fait du bien
Ça s'entend jusqu'ici
Les bruits qu'il y a autour
Les appels à l'amour

Dehors, ça sert à rien
Y a de tout pour qu'on se perde
Les autoroutes, les yeux des autres
Une main sur mon épaule
Mais tout est fragile

Faudra pas s'quitter des yeux
Si on n'veut pas s'égarer
Faudra marcher deux par deux

Tout est fragile
Faudra se dire, toujours se dire que
Tout est fragile
Je t'aime, j'ai mal et Dieu que tu me manques
Tout est fragile
Faudra se dire, toujours se dire
Tout est fragile
T'es c'que j'ai de mieux à vivre
T'es mon exil
T'es mon exil

Dehors, c'est tell'ment grand
La terre, le ciel, les océans
Seul sur mon parallèle
Je fais l'inventaire de mes jours
De mes rêves à l'amour

Dehors, toutes les artères
Mènent à une vie devant soi
Et de dehors, tu vois, j'en sors
Ma vie me mène toujours à toi
T'es mon exil

Et on saura si tu veux
Malgré tous les vents contraires
Être si fort de nous deux


Tout est fragile
Faudra se dire, toujours se dire que
Tout est fragile
Y'a tant d'espace les jours où tu t'absentes
Tout est fragile
Faudra se dire, toujours se dire que
Tout est fragile
T'es mon plus bel avenir

Il suffirait de peu
Pour qu'on s'écarte de nous
Il suffirait d'un rien
Pour qu'on se perde en chemin

Tout est fragile
Faudra se dire, toujours se dire que
Tout est fragile
Je t'aime, j'ai mal et Dieu que tu me manques

Bruno Pelletier,"""L'amour est un rêve du corps
de ton âme qui devient ciel
de mon âme qui devient port
de ma terre qui devient miel""

Ce besoin d’avoir un amant
Cette faim d’être bien à deux
Et de se faire des enfants
Ce goût de l’eau mélée au feu

J’en veux j’en veux

L’amour souffle comme le vent
Qui tarabuste les oiseaux
C’est un barbare qui souvent
Laisse nos rêves en lambeaux

Puis soudain, ou est-il passé
La mer est calme et le ciel clair
Quelques éclairs dans nos pensées
Et pourtant de ce libertaire

J’en veux j’en veux 

L’amour me fait des ennemis
Chez ceux qui savent pas aimer
Ou bien qui n’aiment qu’à demi
Par égoïsme ou par fierté

Moi j’ai besoin d’être serrée
Dans le tempo humain de ta peau
Et de tes mots énamourés
Grésillants comme des mégots

J’en veux j’en veux

J’aime l’amour
J’aime l’envie
J’aime tous les jours 
De ma vie
Et jusqu’à l’instant de l’adieu

J’en veux j’en veux",J'En Veux,2009

Brunori Sas,"Sono le 4 del mattino
Guardi la tv
Abbracciato ad un cuscino
Che cos'è che vuoi di più

Lei che dorme lì al tuo fianco
Chissà cosa sta sognando
Le accarezzi un po' I capelli
Poi cerchi il telecomando

E la conosci questa sensazione?
Questo senso di vuoto senza una ragione
C'è un frigorifero più grande
Ma la bottiglia è sempre quella lì

Sembra una moglie paziente
Che non ti rinfaccia mai niente
E non ti chiede dove sei stato, cosa hai fatto
La trovi sempre lì

Tra una carota e una cipolla
Ti dice, ""Amore vieni a prendermi""
Ma la conosci bene quella tentazione?
Quella voglia di fuggire senza una ragione

Lalalala, lalalala
E hai lasciato quel pacchetto
Dentro alla valigia blu
Avrai smesso 100 volte e

Cento volte e adesso una in più
E c'è gente che lavora
Aspettando un altro lunedì
Mentre il cielo si colora

E riesce anche a sorprenderti
Perché quest'alba è una benedizione
È un bacio, una carezza, una consolazione

Lalala, lalalala
E ritorni a letto
Spegni la tv

Scusa mia cara ragione
Passerò per coglione
Ma è meglio così

Ci si può riuscire soltanto poggiando su cose leggere
Del resto non si può ignorare
La voce che dice che oltre le stelle
C’è un posto migliore
Un giorno qualunque ti viene la voglia
Di andare a vedere, di andare a scoprire se è vero
Che non sei soltanto una scatola vuota
O l’ultima ruota del carro più grande che c’è

Ma chiedilo a Kurt Cobain
Come ci si sente a stare sopra a un piedistallo
E a non cadere

E quanto ci si può sentire soli
E non provare più niente

E non avere più niente

C’è un mondo migliore

Di andare a vedere, di andare a scoprire se è vero
Che il senso profondo di tutte le cose
Lo puoi ritrovare soltanto guardandoti in fondo

Brunori Sas,"C'erano pile di libri sottolineati di rosso e di blu
C'erano articoli e leggi che oggi non ricordo più
E c'era la sigaretta fumata di fretta all'uscita del bar
Tabacco e profumo per sentirmi un uomo

Lontano da casa da mamma e dal mare e c'eri tu
Maddalena e Madonna stretta sotto la gonna
La mia voglia di averti allora
E c'erano 10 vagoni

2000 terroni al binario 3
Valigie e borsoni
E dai finestrini lo sguardo d'amore più triste che c'è
Gente del sud stipata sui treni

Sorrisi e canzoni e la voglia di andare ancora
E c'era l'amore che cambiava il colore del cielo il sapore del vino
L'odore dell'aria al mattino era solo per te
Che scrivevo cazzate su un foglio a quadretti e canzoni in barrè

C'era la primavera la prima sera davanti al Bibò
Un bacio un errore non restarci male
Ti voglio bene ma è meglio di no
E notti da frate indovino a sputare il destino in fondo a un caffè
Come un moscerino che affoga nel vino
Cercando un profumo che altrove non c'è
Profumo di te

Maddalena e Madonna ogni tanto ritorna
La mia voglia di averti ancora
E c'era l'amore che cambiava il colore del cielo il sapore del vino

È il tempo delle molotov
Tutti pazzi per Maria

Alla fine ti sei scocciato di inseguire il bianconiglio
Hai cullato troppi sogni e adesso culli un altro figlio
Alla fine ti sei scordato anche la felce e il mirtillo

E il cane che pisciava sui fogli di giornale
E' che spesso a Natale mi viene il magone
Con le luci, il presepe e tutte quelle persone
Con i pacchi dei regali, con le facce tutte uguali
Col boccone sempre in bocca come un branco di maiali
E pensare com'era bella questa notte 30 anni fa
Alla luce di un'altra stella, alla luce di un'altra età

E continuo a sognare con la casa sul mare
Con la spiaggia e una barca per andare a pescare
Qualche pesce tropicale o vecchie storie marinare
Di stelle cadenti che diventano lampare
Ma di mare qui c'è solo questa stupida insalata
Ennesima portata dell'ennesimo cenone
E farfalle col salmone, lo spumante e il panettone
I ragazzi improfumanti in attesa del veglione
E pensare com'eri bella, quella notte 20 anni fa
Quella notte di luna piena, solo d'ingenuità
Cosa rimane? mogli, figli, fantasie
Forse è il momento di andare
Corri! e scappa via
Ma poi ti fermi un secondo e rimani così
A pensare che il peggio è passato, ad un passo da qui

Canzoni per chi non ha voglia d'abbaiare o di ringhiare
Canzoni tanto per cantare

Canzoni che parlano d'amore
Perché alla fine, dai, di che altro vuoi parlare?
Che se ti guardi intorno non c'è niente da cantare
Solamente un grande vuoto che a guardarlo ti fa male
Perciò sarò superficiale
Ma in mezzo a questo dolore

Canzoni contro la paura

Canzoni che ti salvano la vita
Che ti fanno dire ""no, cazzo, non è ancora finita!""
Che ti danno la forza di ricominciare
Che ti tengono in piedi quando senti di crollare
Ma non ti sembra un miracolo
Che in mezzo a questo dolore
E tutto questo rumore
A volte basta una canzone
Anche una stupida canzone
Solo una stupida canzone
A ricordarti chi sei
A ricordarti chi sei

Perché l'amore, l'amore è un colpo di pistola
L'amore, l'amore è un pugno sulla schiena
È uno schiaffo per cena
L'amore ti sfiora appena

E poi perché l'ho fatto non lo so
Forse per non sentire ancora un altro no
Uscire dalla sua bocca dorata
Prima l'ho uccisa e dopo l'ho baciata

Brunori Sas,"Tutto quello che mi passa per la testa sembra avere senso
Quando penso che la vita forse un senso non ce l'ha
Certo non è bello quando guardo il mio castello in aria
E penso che un castello così bello
Sulla Terra così bello non ci sta

La mia età non è questa
È almeno la metà

La mia spada da torero
Oggi salvo il mondo intero
Con un gioco di magia
Non sarò mai abbastanza cinico
Da smettere di credere
Che il mondo possa essere
Migliore di così

Tutto quello che mi serve adesso
È ritrovarmi con me stesso perché spesso
Con me stesso ritrovarmi non mi va
Certo non si può nemmeno stare
Tutto il giorno a disegnare
Una casetta con il sole
Quando il sole se ne va

La realtà è una merda
Ma non finisce qua
Passami il mantello nero
Il costume da torero
Oggi salvo il mondo intero
Con un pugno di poesie

Non sarò mai abbastanza cinico

Lo sappiamo bene erano un gioco

Questo corpo ormai non mi appartiene
Questo letto, questo specchio ormai rifletterà
Sulla tela solo il mio dolore
Che ho provato ad annegare in un fiume di Mezcal
Ma il dolore sai, non sa nuotare
Braccia forti che purtroppo non ho avuto mai
Per tenerti e non lasciarti andare

Ma va, dove ti pare
Tanto prima o poi
Lo so che tornerai a bussare
Sì, che questo è amore
Puoi dirlo bene

And was playing soft

I was rotten to the core so
Naturally I knew you'd pull back
You made it clear that you wanted more
So I attempted to please ya
But my feelings go deeper
Then it all came to a stop
Because of a few heartless words we said

It's like me and you didn't even try
We just said goodbye
We let this love here die
And never looked back
In my mind I'm still questioning why
Promises turn to lies
Feelings bottled inside
When the truth be told I

What if we would've worked out
I believe we could've worked out
If we worked a little harder

What if?
What if we would've worked out
I believe we could've worked out

Worked a little harder
Yeah if we worked a little harder

To believe that love could work
So I hope that you would be there
That's the reason why it still hurts

Wish I could reverse our season turning
It's this lesson I'm tired of learning

A little more patience
A little more respect

This ain't no disco 
And it ain't no country club either,

All I want to do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or buddy

And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

Until the sun comes up over 
Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an over-sized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads 

But,

[Chorus]

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon , 

But, all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun

Bryan Bowers,"How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten

And my time has run out

Come and sit by my side, if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

I've been thinking a long time, my darling
Of the sweet words you never would say
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish
For they say you are gong away

Do you think of the valley you're leaving
O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

They will bury me where you have wandered
Near the hills where the daffodils grow
When you're gone from the Red River Valley
For I can't live without you I know

Bryan Duncan,"I know the things that hurt you by heart
I know before the bad feelings start
I'm watching how you turn away melting inside
And I know you think you'll fix it yourself

You think of Me, it scares you away
Pretty sure you know what I'd say
You've heard so many people cry, speaking for Me
They all claim
You oughta know right by now

(Chorus):
Take a look at Me, don't you know Me
I've always been by your side
Take another look at Me, you can need Me
I know when you're tired, and when you're alone and lost.


You're so afraid of tippin' your hand
Or learning where this hurting began
You like the way they see you now, from the outside
So you try to hide how desperate you are

(Chorus):
Take a look at Me, you can trust Me
I'll always be by your side
Take another look at Me, you can need Me
I know when you're tired, and when you're alone and lost


(bridge):
I'm not surprised by the things you do and say
You'll never see Me walking away
I've been there at every turn you take,
And the mistakes you've made
It hurts to see you not looking to Me

A whisper heard around the world

Lord, I know You hear when I pray
Everything I couldn't put into words
And when no one hears a word I say

And when I'm faint of heart, mmm

But let You know about the flood in my soul
I can barely give it up to You

But I'm afraid to let my people down so I'm actin like I'm Moses and I know the way

Bryan Duncan,"I was the first man in Eden...back in the Garden had a great little place
It was just me and the Lord and we never got bored...we invented the whole human race
Then we went for a walk in the evening...he said, ""I can't help but notice you're blue""
So the next thing he said was, ""let me borrow a rib and we'll just see what a woman might do""

Well, I slept through the whole operation ...awoke to find Eve at my side
And God said, ""you can have everything in the garden
You can name everything that you see
But just remember one thing what the Devil may bring
And stay away from the fruit of that tree""

Well the first couple weeks was a pleasure... just enough for my new baby and me
We were never apart; we were lovers at heart....never came even close to that tree
'Til I left her alone unattended and she returned from her first shopping spree
It was a sweet little find that I shoulda declined when she handed that mango to me

Now were blaming everything on the Devil, but I remember what God said to me..
He said, ""you can have everything in the garden
You can name everything that you see
Just remember one thing what the Devil may bring
And stay away from the fruit of that tree""

Back when the Earth was still all milk and honey
Couldn't get it right with only one rule to follow
Guess I need a lot of help from God Almighty
If I want to get back to that Garden tomorrow

Bryan Ferry,"I knew there'd be times like this
When I'd sit at home and reminisce
Oh how one's memory slips...
So I close my book
And sighing, take a second look
Sure enough - I'm quite alone
Still, there no sound
So I spin-a-disc around and around
And slide the needle in the groove...

Drive down any highway baby
But don't bid me adieu
Through a sea of twisting byways
I'll be trailing you
Eternity'll solve our problem
Take it as you may
And destiny will stand corrected
Should we connect some day

Another time - to spend
Another place - to go
Another love to share with you

Deep emotion springs from this life
Wells up inside
Quick, pick me up and pour me over
The clouds crying by

Another time - to spend
Another place - to go
Another love this time it's true

Anyway you want me lover
Used to be your tune
I looked you up - you looked me over
My lucky strike won through

I was cut, dried and discarded
Just a rusty blade
But since I found my four leaf clover
I've seen the light again

All the tears
In the world
Seem to fall from you
At their
Rainbow's end
A halcyon day
Or two
How soon
We fool ourselves
How slow
We tread
Astral planes
Collide head on
And on and on we glide
As if forever","Another Time, Another Place",1974

How's your new love?
I hope he's doing fine

Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want babe

To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong

Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me babe
No, no, no
It ain't me babe
It ain't me that you're looking for babe

Go lightly from the ledge babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want babe
I will only let you down

You say, you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart

Someone who will die for you and more

But it ain't me babe
No, no, no
It ain't me babe
It ain't me that you're looking for babe

Go melt back in to the night babe
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothin' in here that's a moving
And anyway I'm not alone

You say, you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call

A lover for your life and nothing more

No, no, no
It ain't me babe
It ain't me, you're looking for babe

Bryan Ferry,"If I could be you and you could be me for just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside each other's minds
If you could see you, through my eyes, instead of your ego
I believe you'd be, surprised to see, that you'd been blind

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse
Criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now the whole world you see around you is just a reflection
And the law of karma, says you reap, just what you sow
So unless you've, lived a life of total perfection
You'd better be careful of every stone that you should throw
And yet we spend the day throwing stones at one another
'cause I don't think or wear my hair the same way you do
Well I may be common people but I'm your brother

And when you strike out and try to hurt me it's a-hurtin you
There are people on reservations and out in the ghettos
And brother, there but for the grace of god go you and I
If I only, had the wings, of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly, to the top of the mountain, and then I'd cry",Walk a Mile In My Shoes,1974

You'll never know dear, how much I love you

I'll always love you and make you happy

You'll regret it all someday

You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

Here's looking at you kid

Long time, since we're together
Now I hope it's forever

Bryan Ferry,"Hark the frozen chimes of winter
Crystal shimmer in your mind
To the first time when you saw her
You implored her to be kind

In the open fields around you
All before you gone to ground
Both the question and the answer
Deep inside you, you shall find

And while you're strollin'
Through the summer of your years
Enchanted, a garden overgrown

Don't call me sentimental
Those of you who care
Could find there a lover and a friend to the end

And if you're taken
By the spirit of your age
No reason to carve the cornerstone

Sway me, trade me
Your philosophy
First you're sowin', then you're growin'
Then you reap until you sleep

Will you scale the silver studded mountain?
Where contemplation will spring to mind
See the veiled prophet's withered gaze reflect the 'Nouvelle-vague'
Glazed visions imprisoned in your mind

Unwinding rivers flowing through the meadows to the sea
Paths of glory through shifting glades to fall
Present laughter and the memory of troubles you have seen
It is written in your mind
",In Your Mind,1977
Bryan Ferry,"Love me madly again
Are you still cutting it on the street
Do you make savage love when you meet
In the zigzag shadows that promises much

Don't talk about it, love me up

Is that lightning exciting ya quite as much

Don't talk about it, show me
Talkin' about it's, easy
Don't talk about it, love me up
Is it as passionate as it seemed?

Was it for real or some kind of dream?
Don't talk about it, it's not the same

And should we meet again
Uncertain, out of reach
On the other side of time

Barriers broken
Thoughts entwine
Never words spoken

And who can draw the line
A strand from me to you
A world apart, a smile
Loving is easy
Hard to end

Bryan Ferry,"Now is the moment
Here is the place
Soon's the time to go

Seeing's believin'
So he thought once
Now he's not so sure

One kiss, one for the road, what is more?
One kiss roughly expressing all that lips are for

Where do they come from?
Doesn't she speak?
Where can they go from here?

Forever or never
Or once in a while
Their situation's clear

One kiss, never too late to miss
One too many a broken-up affair like this

Spinning together
Drifting away
The song of love is strange

A never ending
See you soon
Too late, the music's changed

One kiss, what kind of end is this?
One more touching impression, one lost love, one kiss

Just as he's trying
To open the door
He fumbles with the key

Clumsily playing for time
Without words
Some things you can only feel

One kiss, lost in shade
One tear, ever so slowly falling left to fade

With gold and silver I did support her

Full of open hearts turned to stone
All together, all alone

Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
Let the strobe light up them all
I close my eyes and dance till dawn

Dance away the heartache
Dance away your fears, dance away
Dance away, dance away

Until I find an open door
Off the street onto the floor

There was I, many times a fool
I hope and pray but not too much
Out of reach is out of touch
All the way is far enough

What a man's gotta do

Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol""

In a trance
Bamboo dancer

No stranger
Down in limbo
Can you tango?

Takes two to
Down in limbo
You are the one

Now is the time
Let your memory beat the drum
On the street car line

Voodoo warning
Is calling
Down in limbo

Moonlight lush life
Bears strange fruit
Down in limbo

Creole tattoo
I buy you
Down in limbo

Heartbeat you mistreat
I owe you
Down in limbo",Limbo,1992

Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray
To a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight
Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight

Or just a moment's pleasure

And will you still love me tomorrow

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

The way she walks
The way she talks
How long I can I pretend
Oh I can´t help it i´m in love
With the girl of my best friend
Her lovely hair her skin so fair
I could go on ´n´ never end
No I can´t help it i´m love
With the girl of my best friend
I want to tell her how I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either once again
The way they kiss their happiness
Will my aching heart ever mend
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend
Never end

One love affair for two
And so with time on my hands
And you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you",Time on My Hands,1999
Bryan Ferry,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Oh but you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it ?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight.",The Way You Look Tonight,1999
Bryan Ferry,"When somebody thinks you're wonderful
What a difference in your day
Seems as though your troubles disappear
Like a feather in your way

When somebody thinks you're wonderful
Tells you with a smile so sweet
What are little stones you step upon
Just a meadow 'neath your feet
And how you meet the morning
And gaily swing along

At night you may be weary
But your heart still sings a song
When somebody thinks you're wonderful
Love is mighty close to you
Just another thing more wonderful
Making all her dreams come true",When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful,1999
Bryan Ferry,"It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And that we laughed before, also loved before

Something that simply mystifies me

That nobody else could do",You Do Something to Me,1999
Bryan Ferry,"Oh where have you been, my blue eyed son?
Where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
Stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in a mouth of a graveyard

It's a hard and it's a hard and it's a hard and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall

What did you see, my darling young one?

I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
A white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it's a hard and it's a hard and it's a hard hard
And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
What did you hear, my darling young one
I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve, many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young girl whose body was burning
A young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
Another man who was wounded with hatred

And it's a hard and it's a hard and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall

I'm goin' back out 'fore the rain starts fallin'
Walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where people are many and their hands are all empty
Where pellets of poison are flooding the waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, and none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountains so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand in the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start singing

And a hum drum ways 
Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free 
Hey Sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me 
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered ""I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol""
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses 
Now, the paint is peeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling

Written By Bryan Ferry & Brian Eno
I thought - you'd be my streetcar named desire 
My way - my taste of wine 
I thought - you'd be that flame within the fire 
One dream that just won't die 
 
All night - looking for new love 
Impossible true love - nothing at all 
Looking for new gods - looking for new blood 
Looking for you 
 
I thought - I'd find you walking in the rain 
Just like a wayward child 
I thought - I'd find you calling out my name 
So foolish is my pride 
 
All night - looking for new love 
Impossible true love - nothing at all 
Looking for new ways - looking for strange blood 
Looking for you 
 
I thought - I'd be your streetcar named desire 
Your man - the one you seek 
I thought - I'd take you deep within myself

Hold on - the flower says reach out 
The thunder says no shout is greater than mine 
Listen and hold on - till the day fades out

But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Look out the saints are cominâ?? through
And itâ??s all over now, Baby Blue.
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
This sky, too, is folding under you
And itâ??s all over now, Baby Blue.

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
All your reindeer armies, are all going home.
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And itâ??s all over now, Baby Blue.

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
Forget the dead youâ??ve left, they will not follow you.
The vagabond whoâ??s rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew

In every dream home a heartache
And every step I take
Takes me further from heaven
Is there a heaven?
I'd like to think so
Standards of living
They're rising daily
But home oh sweet home
It's only a saying
From bell push to faucet
In smart town apartment
The cottage is pretty
The main house a palace
Penthouse perfection
But what goes on
What to do there
Better pray there

Open plan living
Bungalow ranch style
All of its comforts
Seem so essential
I bought you mail order
My plain wrapper baby
Your skin is like vinyl
The perfect companion
You float my new pool
De luxe and delightful
Inflatable doll
My role is to serve you
Disposable darling
Can't throw you away now
Immortal and life size
My breath is inside you
I'll dress you up daily
And keep you till death sighs

But you blew my mind

It's curfew gull, it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides

With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains

Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Alladin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the golden calf

On their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the gates of Eden

Relationships of a ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned accordingly
To wait for succeeding kings

And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden

The motorcycle black Madonna
A two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream

As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means

At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden

Tingle to his bones, it was then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
Watch out for a simple twist of fate

They walked along by the old canal
Was so confused, I remember well
Stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
It hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
She is walking under the arcade
The light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
Forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up and the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself that he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears a ticking of the clock
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
Oh, how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

But now you never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
Come on now baby give our love a try

Bryan Ferry,"She may be the face I can't forget
A trace of pleasure or regret
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
She may be the song that Salome sings
May be the chill that autumn brings
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day

She may be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell
She may be the mirror of my dream
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem
Inside her shell

She who always seems so happy in a crowd
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I remember till the day I die

She may be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough and ready years
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is she, she
Mmm, she",She,2008

I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.

By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Our words were told, our songs were sung,
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.

With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
We never thought we could ever get old.
We thought we could sit forever in fun
But our chances really was a million to one.

As easy it was to tell black from white,
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.

How many a year has passed and gone,
And many a gamble has been lost and won,
And many a road taken by many a friend,
And each one I've never seen again.

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.",Bob Dylan's Dream [#],2012

In the beginning
Before the darkness
And the fall

On your heartbeat
Cloaking the dagger
Of your soul

But there’s no sense in pretending
I know I’ll never fall in love again

One morning
And you’re living in a world
That’s hard to face
What if the good times
Turn to sorrow
What if a stranger
Takes your place

Through all the thunder and the rain
But there’s no sense in pretending
I know I’ll never fall in love again

Burning the river
Into gold
Count all the minutes
Then the hours
Until your heart turns cold

I’m trembling with rage
I’m wrestling with my demons

I can’t make it out

You’re driving me wild, 
You’re driving me wild, 
You’re driving me wild,
You’re driving me wild, 
You’re driving me wild, 
You’re driving me wild.

It’s tearing me apart
How can I escape
The shape I’m in
No dream will ever be the same
Everything around calls your name

I’m dealing with a feeling
Like nobody knows an unkindness of ravens
A murder of crows

Out in the cold
I’m feeling so bad
Can’t stop thinking about you
And times we had

You’re driving me wild…

Don’t leave me in despair
Listen to my plea
Just one more time
I know that love can be unfair
Wandering on my own, one of a kind

I keep on blaming myself
I’m a wise guy why do I end up on the shelf
A man with a mission, a dog with a bone
I type with one finger, destination unknown

You’re driving me wild…

If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like,

And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got

From those little radios.

She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything

She's, ""I want a piece of chocolate""
""Take me to a movie""
She's ""I can't find a thing to wear""
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing

She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

[Chorus]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday

She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother

She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

[Chorus]

She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me

Every day that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah, she's everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me",She's Everything,2005
Bryan Lee,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves
Before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down

Bryan McConnell,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above

Lover where can you be

Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away

You used to do
I'm so lonely

I walk along with you

You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again

How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
