Linda,"There is something in the way
You're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me
To a point of no return
I don't believe in Gods
But I pray for you

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for
Don't you leave no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

Don't let them get you
Stay away from the sun
It's too bright for you
Your eyes getting blurry
Still I'm crying your name
I don't believe in God
But I pray for you

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for
Don't you leave no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

There is something in the way
You're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me
To a point of no return
So the light fades out at you
So close to lose it

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for
Don't you leave no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love
Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live my life for
No don't leave
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love
Don't you slip away","Faraway, Vol. 2",2003
Linda Arnold,"For the benefit of Mr. Kite 
There will be a show tonight on trampoline 
The Hendersons will all be there 
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene 
Over men and horses hoops and garters 
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world! 

The celebrated Mr. K. 
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate 
The Hendersons will dance and sing 
As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late 
Messrs. K and H. assure the public 
Their production will be second to none 
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz! 

The band begins at ten to six 
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound 
And Mr. H. will demonstrate 
Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground 
Having been some days in preparation 
A splendid time is guaranteed for all 
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill",Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,2005
Linda Arnold,"If you go down to the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise.
If you go down to the woods today
You'd better go in disguise!

For ev'ry bear that ever there was
Will gather there for certain,
Because today's the day the
Teddy Bears have their picnic.

Picnic time for Teddy Bears
The little Teddy Bears are having
A lovely time today.
Watch them, catch them unawares,
And see them picnic on their holiday.

See them gaily gad about.
They love to play and shout,
They never have any care;
At six o'clock their Mommies and Daddies
Will take them home to bed,
Because they're tired little Teddy Bears

Ev'ry Teddy Bear who's been good
Is sure of a treat today.
There's lots of marvelous things to eat
And wonderful games to play.

Beneath the trees where nobody sees
They'll hide and seek as long as they please
'Cause that's the way the
Teddy Bears have their picnic.

Linda Bianchi,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,
Linda Bianchi,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,
Linda Bianchi,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2001
Linda Bieda Coil,"I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me
(Love how you love me)

I love how your heart beats whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me without being told to
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me

Linda Bieda Coil,"I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore

When life's sun sinks in the west
Lord, may I have done my best
May I find sweet peace and rest
In that happy home of the blessed

Linda Cable,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby,1992
Linda Cable,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1992
Linda Cable,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1992

Linda Carriere,"From the day that I first met you
And you looked into my eyes
I could hardly believe
Love took me by surprise
And now that we are friends
I don`t want it to end
`cause I would rather lose your love
To be your friend
I guess I never told you
Exactly how I feel
`cause I believe if you knew
You`d probably just leave
Don`t know what i`d do
Without you
Be on my own again
Without you
Bridge:
Don`t understand it
If I could have planned it
How would it be
There`s no use pretending
Don`t want our love ending
No
The way I feel about you
I could never let you know
And all the feelings I have
I`m too afraid to let them show
So I close my eyes and count to ten
`cause I would rather lose your love
To be your friend
I`d rather lose your love to be your friend",Just Friends,2002
Linda Ciofalo,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, cant you see, I'm in love

Life's a beautiful thing

Linda Ciofalo,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2000

Linda Ciofalo,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Linda Ciofalo,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside

Linda Ciofalo,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

Now 10 years have come and gone

It gets harder each day to face the mirror
She knows 30's on the way
Afraid she'll find another wrinkle
Or spot another trace of gray

In the crash of 29
In the prime of her life
In the great depression
She sits at home and cries
She's lost the will to love
And wonders how she'll find
The strength or the heart to survive

She hates him for the way he left her
Bittersweet memories hanging 'round
She hates herself because she still loves him
But only love can save her now

You stand by me no matter how things are
If I haven't told you lately how I feel

And then you make a dream come true

In my day dreams I could see

So you'll know what to do if your greener grass turns blue
If your sunny sky turns gray
Sometimes you gotta run
To see just what you're running from
Here at home there'll always be place for you

To give to the man at the station

I think a ray of hope has finally found me 
Here in the dark 
I can see some light through the cracks of my broken heart",Through the Cracks,1998
Linda Davis,"Oh you don't have blue eyes. 
I expected blue eyes. 
That's how I pictured you would be. 

And you don't have long hair. 
I thought you'd have long hair. 
So this is all a shock to me.

I didn't know if you would meet me. 
Or believe me. 
When I said that I was fooled.
I really thought that I would hate you. 
I know I meant to. 
There'd only be one of us left when we're through.

[Chorus]
Now that we're face to face. 
And I put myself in your place. 
I see the truth. 
I see who's really to blame. 
And I won't play his game. 
Or try to get even. 
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving.
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes. 
Now that we're face to face.

I believe in true love something to be sure of. 
Isn't that what we deserve. 
There's no blame here, we both end up the same here. 
A little wiser than we were. 
There was a time this would have killed me. 
And it may still be. 
Hard to look you in the eye.
And now that all the spells are broken. 
The truth's been spoken. 
My heart has the strength to tell him goodbye.

[Chorus]",Face to Face,1998
Linda Davis,"Well the sun beats down and the sand gets hot 
Where I break my back hauling endless rock 
For a man made God 
I really don't believe in 
I shoulder the rope and I bear the strain 
Wipe the salt from my eyes and ignore the pain 
Though I know when I fall 
Another whip is coming 
When I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

I'm a prisoner here in this hall of kings 
I'm gold I'm jewels I'm a diamond ring 
To be given as a token of God's affection 
The law says I'm their property 
But my heart and my soul belong to me 
They can hold me but I'll never be in their possession 
When I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

Through the doubt 
Give me strength to lead them out 
Give them faith to follow me 
Guide us through the sea 

So help me God I'm a common man 
With the lives of thousands in my hands 
As I carry them into the land you promised 
And when I feel my body going down 
And there's nothing I can do 
I know if I keep my faith in you 
I'm gonna make it through 

I know if I keep my faith in you 
We're gonna make it through",Make It Through,1998

I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry, no one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

Deep in my soul I've been so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching even after today
So there it is girl, I've said it all now
And here we are babe, what do you say?
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

I know it's late, I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely

I'm not the foolish girl you used to know

I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah yeah, mmm, yeah yeah

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lines
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else

I'm running things my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm gonna take my turn

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Yes, it's a good day for shinin' your shoes,
And it's a good day for losin' the blues,
Ev'rything to gain and nothin' to lose,
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.

If you believed in me

It's a honky tonk parade

Time marches in place at this address
I can't bring myself to change a single thing
Every photograph still haunts me from its frame
I still can't believe I lost your love
Half empty closets should be proof enough
Tho' you made it clear, there would be no turning back
This flame burns in the face of cold hard facts

Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring
Faithfully, when I should be letting go
Holding on like late November leaves
Crazy Me

I guess that I should get on with my life
Soon as my heart learns the meaning of goodbye
Take the pieces up and put them in their place
If reality was something I could face
Your memory is something I just can't erase

Linda Davis,"We were all we ever wanted
Before there was a single brick in this wall
That keeps the distance here between us
We built ourselves a life and we forgot
We already had it all

When we made love, we made love
Baby, we had something
That nothing else could touch
When we made love

Through the lonely that divides us
I can feel you're reaching from the other side
Let's tear down this wall and start all over
And we'll get back to the simple life

Just pass the doubts beyond the hurt
We're not too far from where we were

Linda de Suza,"Elle a les yeux noirs de sa mère
Et sa tendresse et ses colères 
Elle ose dire qu'elle en est fière
L'étrangère
Elle a gardé une carte postale
De son village du Portugal
Elle a des souvenirs qui font mal
L'étrangère
Bien sûr elle a changé de vie
Quand elle est arrivée ici
Elle n'avait pas un seul ami
L'étrangère
Elle s'est habituée à Paris
Elle aime les gens de ce pays
Et de fados en mélodies populaires 

Elle chante avec du soleil dans la voix 
Elle chante des amours qui n'existent pas 
Elle chante pour les pauvres gens, pour les rois
Elle chante tout ce qu'elle dit, tout ce qu'elle croit

De son côté de la frontière
Elle n'a jamais connu l'hiver
Elle sait le prix de la misère 
L'étrangère
Elle n'a rien oublié de ceux
Qui chantent avec les larmes aux yeux
Alors elle est restée pour eux
La lumière

Elle chante avec du soleil dans la voix 
Elle chante des amours qui n'existent pas 
Elle chante pour les pauvres gens, pour les rois
Elle chante tout ce qu'elle dit, tout ce qu'elle croit

Elle aime les enfants, les rivières
Les grands gâteaux d'anniversaires 
Les vacances au bord de la mer 
L'étrangère
Elle a peur de te dire je t'aime
Elle est un peu cartomancienne
Elle a le cœur d'une bohémienne

Elle ne sait pas bien dire pardon
C'est un volcan c'est la passion 
C'est la douceur d'une fontaine

Il faut lui murmurer tout bas

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Linda Eder,"The moon is afraid to come out tonight
There'll be no dinners by candlelight,
There is an aura of doom in the air,
And a storm out at sea

Every Picasso tonight is in blue.
The currency's plummeting down in Peru.
And it won't come back
Till you come back to me.

The world's gone mad,
Since we have parted.
And mother nature doesn't like
What she can see.
She's feeling sad, and brokenhearted.
But she'll be feeling better

How to lose

And the hole in the sky makes the winter
A balmy one hundred and three.

The poets are striking, but not for the pay
And they won't write, till you come 
Back to me

It's clear to see, we were mistaken

Could not create such tragedy
Don't you agree- fist steps must be taken
But we can fix this mess
When you come back to me

Tonight every song is a bit out of tune
The cow tried to jump
But crashed into the moon
You have to admit it cannot be too soon
Till we're in harmony

For what really matters we never can learn.

When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes,
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
When you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

I will ease your mind

Still run through my veins
I had some dreams, you know
But they all got swept away with the rains 
Tonight I'll make your dreams come true
But don't confuse the fire with romance
For I will not remember you
You are just another tango to dance
And there'll always be a tango to dance
For a few pesetas, I'll take you
To paradise
Just a few pesetas can take you
A few pesetas more takes you twice
Tonight I'll make your dreams come true
But don't confuse the fire with romance
For I will not remember you
You are just another tango to dance
And there'll always be a tango to dance",The Last Tango,1997
Linda Eder,"Hear me now oh thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base and debauched as can be
And a knight with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
Destroyer of Evil am I,
I will march to the sound of the trumpets of glory
Forever to conquer or die

Hear me heathens and wizards and serpents of sin
All your dastardly doings are past
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last!

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
A Name all the world soon will know
And the wild winds of fortune will carry me onward
Oh whither so ever they blow

Whither so ever they blow
Onward to Glory I go!

This night begins to change who we are

Whispering through you

We can't go back to where we were

Let it release you

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

In a very unusual way
You were my friend
Maybe it lasted a day
Maybe it lasted an hour
But somehow it will never end

In a very unusual way
I want to cry
Something inside me goes weak
Something inside me surrenders
And you're the reason why, you're the reason why
You don't know what you do to me
You don't have a clue
You can't tell what it's like to be me looking at you
It scares me so that I can hardly speak

In a very unusual way
I owe what I am to you
Though at times it appears I won't stay, I'LL NEVER GO.

Since the first day that I met you
How could I ever forget you
Once you had touched my soul

In a very unusual way
You made me whole

I think of you when spring was new
And fall was miles away
And when I close my eyes I see you
And I don't feel the chill
When autumn comes... it's summer still

When autumn comes and wild geese fly
I wonder do you see them too
Across the restless sky
And does October catch you dreaming
Of Central Park in June
Or is love lost beneath the frost 
Of aumtumn's moon

SUmmers by the sea
When the sun would linger till the moon was high
Days of you and me
Underneath a sheltering sky
Did we move too fast for the glow of love to last

When autumn comes and summer goes
I will remember through November
What September knows:
That nothing lasts forever and
Summer love moves on

So when the leaves begin to change
I find it sad but never strange
That you are all I can recall
When autumn comes to call",When Autumn Comes,1997

You may be crazy
Foolish, illogical take your pick
But, baby, you are my lunatic

You are the sixth or seventh such guess
At last, success

I guess I love you, you have become my vice
Bring on the shoes and start throwin' rice
You're paradise go figure, who could have guessed
I'd be so franticly, romantically by you possessed

The odds are good, that knock on wood
This time we're gonna win, 'cause when you kiss me

Call the times with the news
Tell them ""Boys, stop the presses
I've got a headline for you""
Just say: ""I certify there's a guy whose love is true""

Because I don't need advice
What you've got is too hot for me not to roll the dice

Let the rumors go wild, let the gossips just chatter
And let the scandal commence
We'll just tell them we fell and to hell with common sense

Take a deep breath and sing it all over the place
Then breathlessly whisper the encore
I love you and it's no secret anymore

I've always played love too close to the vest
Trying to hide it somehow
Acting as if I was under arrest till now

The familiar way the scent of you clings
In the coolness of the night
It's the little things

It's the honest way you ask how I'm feeling
And the way you still agree though I'm wrong
It's the little things in life
That carry me along

And it's the peace that I find
When it all slows down
And I feel something in the air
Keeps me from losing my mind

In this crazy world
When there's some little thing to share
'Cause all alone here with you
The little things will do
Everyone's always reaching for brass rings

As for me, I'm content with the view
When the afternoon shadows play
With the breezes at end of day
There is nothing I need to say

Let the fireworks start, let the band begin
Those things don't really matter at all
'Cause when the crowds all go home
And I look within, the extravagant gestures seem small

Which started something called the Constitution

A doubleday to say: three outs per inning
That's all...Play ball

I was all through with romance
Figured love was kaput
No more pretending, no happy ending
Then like a bolt from the blue
You walked into my life
Clever and charming, slightly alarming
Just when I thought that my love life was all past tense
Suddenly you start making sense

I was prepared to simply call it a day
Ready for love to turn the lights out
Then all my reasons found your rhyme
In the nick of time
Looks like you started something now I wasn't ready for this
Was content all alone
Studio flat, sir, maybe a cat, sir
Hey, this is now that was then
I'm in business again
Using your razor, driving your blazer
Just when I thought my libido was fireproof
You fan my flames right through the roof

You are the lightening striking Ben Franklin's kite
You are the Kitty-Hawk of romance
You are Columbus setting out
'Cause without a doubt
Looks like you started somethin' now

I sense a brand new beginning
Something akin to break of day
You are the start of a new career
You're the crowing of Chanticleer
Saying: ""Wake up and smell the coffee""

I don't know where we're going or for how long
So I'll rely on fundamentals:
'Cause if a kiss is still a kiss
Let's not finish this
Looks like you started somethin'...
You really started something'...
Looks like you started somethin' now!

Never kiss the way that he kissed me
Never love the way that he loved me
How can I dance now?
Never knew the heat of desire
Never knew the flames could go higher
Never felt the passion, the fire
Now let me dance again

There in his eyes I was lost from the start
Under his spell, losing my heart
Percussion and thunder collided that night
Painting the sky with light

Out of control going out of my mind
I've never felt so free
I left the dancer and Rio behind
But I found the gypsy in me and I'll

And one more for the road

I got the routine
So drop another nickel

I wish you'd make the music
Dreamy and sad

Could tell you a lot

And I've got a lotta things to say
And when I'm gloomy
You gotta listen to me

I'm gonna have it all
This time around Love, I'm gonna find you
Happiness, I'm right behind you
I've had my share of crying
But there's no denying I'm on my way
This time around I'll taste the glory
And I'm not going down without a fight
This is my life, my own story
And this time around I'll get it right
This time around I'm gonna find it

I'm gonna grab that big brass ring
And I'm gonna make it mine

Linda Eder,"Why do people fall in love?
Don't we know love is full of dangers?
Letting loose our foolish hearts
In this world full of perfect strangers
Maybe this time you will find
The moon will treat you kinder
Yes, I'm sure that I recall
That's the reason people fall...
Love is needing to belong
Right or wrong, when you feel the fire
Love is living in mid-air
Young and rare, on a sky-high wire
Hoping this time it will last
You feel your heart beat faster
Yes, I'm sure that I recall
That's the reason people fall in love 
Taking chances you would never take
When wide awake, you risk it all
Half afraid he'll only break your heart
Still you will close your eyes and simply fall
Why do people fall in love?
Are we fools with no hope of winning?
Or perhaps we always see
One last chance for a new beginning
Holding on and letting go
But never really knowing
Well, I guess that after all
That's the reason people fall in love",Why Do People Fall in Love?,1999
Linda Eder,"You never remind me of Paris in spring
A Rembrandt I find, to my mind you don't bring
There's no work of art could start to compare

You never remind me of pricey French wine
Or tuxedoed gents who have dinner at nine
Every other man is Vin Ordinaire

You're so unique I find, so well designed
That every single thing about you
Reminds me of only you

You never remind me of summers in Spain
The sun when it's setting, the sound of the rain
New years with Dick Clark or Park Avenue

You never remind me of Sir Lancelot
My memory of him is totally shot
King Midas touch, not much next to you

'Cause if the truth be known when we're alone
Then every single thing about you
Reminds me of only you

You never remind me of Gods that are Greek, my dear
And though I may hang on each word that you speak, it's clear
Ahead and behind me I lose track of all events
And as a consequence you are my present tense

You never remind me of anyone who
Reminds me of anyone other than you
Compare though I will, I still can't equate

'Cause when you're here with me then vis-à-vis
You raise the heat repeatedly, so if I forget to recall
Remind me again, that's all, that's all, that's all
",You Never Remind Me,1999
Linda Eder,"One Christmas in London
December air
Red busses, snow angels, Trafalgar Square
And now the 2 two of us are walking there
Remember how it used to be

You never told me how to love you
We never spoke of it at all
But Christmas Day when you passed my way
We heard the Bells of St. Paul

All season, and New Years
They rang for me
That winter, was more then
A dream could be
And every morning what I woke to find
Would in the evening still be there?

We never talked about forever
We were in love and through it all
Our hearts would sing, every time they'd ring
The ancient Bells of St. Paul

I searched for a thousand hours
Through the town
And all the places we knew
Past grand old castles and Gothic towers
Hoping they would lead me to you

You never told me how to find you
I had to try first and fall
But all is grand
When you take my hand
We'll find the love we recall
And hear the Bells of St. Paul",The Bells of St. Paul,2000

Linda Eder,"Every year I'd wait for the season
Only Christmas time can bring
I thought I understood the reason
For all the parties and caroling

Every year I'd search for the meaning
Every time I'd dress the tree
Each new ornament and garland
Each decoration was all I'd see
And all that Christmas meant to me Then someone told me Christmas is for children
And I left that behind too long ago
But now I see Christmas through a child's eyes
My new son's eyes

Now every time we ring in the season
And play a Christmas melody
I know that the moment he hears it
He'll bring Christmas back to me

In ancient times did'st give the law,
In cloud, and majesty and awe

Thine own from satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell thy people save,
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave

Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery Rejoice! rejoice! Emmanuel,

Come and cheer our spirits by thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight

What child is this, who laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring Him laud
The babe the son of Mary

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king to own Him
The king of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Haste haste to bring Him laud

With a tail as big as a kite,

With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A child, a child shivers in the cold;
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold

Linda Eder,"I started out the way most do, running on imagination
Out into a world that I was sure I knew
Add a dose of reality and a little desperation
I became a stranger in a stranger land

Wherever I go, whatever I see, I still can feel the child carry me
High on an ocean of innocence 'cause somewhere between
The truth and the dream, there is a moment in time
When you can touch what you left behind

Across the water, across the water
Across the water, on a little higher ground

And so it goes with everyone, we're not really all that different
The older that we get, it seems the less we know
We mortals all immortalize, after we apologize for
All the things we should have said or could have done

Wherever I go, whatever I see, I still can feel the child carry me
High on an ocean of innocence 'cause somewhere between
The truth and the dream, there is a moment in time
When you can touch what you left behind

Across the water, across the water
Across the water, on a little higher ground

The way we were, the dreams we had, don't ever really die
They watch us from a distance as we wave goodbye
But now and then a backward glance, reminds us that there's
Still a chance, so we fill our sails and travel on across the water

Every day in every life is open to interpretation
Thinkin' about what might have been is a waste of time
I don't need to analyze all my little contradictions
As long as I can find my way back home again

Across the water, across the water
Across the water, on a little higher ground
",Across the Water,2002

So I look for the light in the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

I don't understand the things I do

I'm countin' on you to carry me through

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong",Drift Away,2002
Linda Eder,"Everybody needs to be with somebody
Even after all the cold hard facts are known
Like your heart will probably break
What with all that give and take
Still you just can't seem
To leave the thing alone

So you hold your breath
And you count to ten
And you're scared to death
But you close your eyes
And fall in love again
'Cause in the middle of the night
He'll hold you tight
And then everything that's wrong
Will be alright

Now you swear you'll keep romance
In perspective
But, with love,
It's always famine or it's feast
And a hungry heart forgets
Tends to minimize regrets
So as sure as there's
A sunrise in the east
There's a silver moon
That your heart can't waste
And then pretty soon,
There's a stranger's kiss
That you can't wait to taste
'Cause when the apple is in sight
You take a bite
Hopin' everything that's wrong
Will be alright
Maybe this time jealousy and fear
Will get the best of you
Maybe this time you will give a little more
Maybe this time you will look
And find somebody who
Isn't quite as crazy as those times before

So you try again
'Till you get it right
And you never know when to let it go
Or when to hold on tight
But when there's nothin' else that works
Well, love just might
So when romance comes along
We all struggle to belong
So that everything that's wrong
Will be alright

Anyone heard my voice
But from the start we have no choice
Our journeys just begin

I'll never know if I was right
Did I fight hard enough?
When the battles grew too rough
Should I have given in?

But here I stand and swear to you
I did the best that I could do...

I know my voice was just a whisper
But someone may have heard
There were nights the moon above me stirred,
And let me grab a hold
My hands have touched the gold

My hearts been driven by extremes
Blind with dreams, tight with fear
But still God knows that I was hear
And I was so alive

And now I lay the past to rest
For in the end I did my best

You have to live the life you're given
And never close your eyes
You hold on, and stare into the sky,
And burn against the cold
For any moment, you might find the gold!

Through it all
And I am standing tall

I know my voice was just a whisper

Linda Eder,"On Las Cuevas Boulevard
There she works her fingers hard
Playing castanets and swaying
To a steel drum in the dark
She wears flowers in her hair
Sings calypso in the square
People calling out the windows
To the gypsy girl down there

All day long
She waits for
Him to come
And night to fall

She goes
Underneath the colored lights
Where the carnival is flashing bright
The boulevard, just heating up
Her gypsy heart

There he waits beneath the stars
On Las Cuevas Boulevard
She falls into her lover's arms
Sweet gypsy heart

Like a satellite they spin
Her gold scarf against his skin
Her toes tapping on the table
Like she's dancing just for him

Red maracas in his hand
He lifts her up then back again
Turning 'round and 'round in circles
To the rhythm of the band Just until
The sun comes up
Just until
She's had enough

She goes
Underneath the colored lights
Where the carnival is flashing bright
The boulevard, just heating up
Her gypsy heart

There he waits beneath the stars
On Las Cuevas Boulevard
She falls into her lover's arms
Sweet gypsy heart

All day long

And night to fall

Before the world had come to this
I took for granted how my life would be
Assuming that my freedom would be free

Before these evening shadows fell
I reveled in the light of day
I rarely ever cried, my patience wasn't tried
And heroes never died

But if I had my way
Things would be different
Danger wouldn't come from a sky of blue
Choices would be clear

And strangers would be kinder
Love a little blinder
As it saved the day
If I had my way

Every now and then it seems
We live our lives to such extremes
Racing all around, never homeward bound
Losing what we've found

But if I had my way
Things would be different
No one would believe that a lie was true
Choices would be clear

And wisdom would be heeded
Warnings never needed
This is what I'd pray
If I had my way

The milk of human kindness
Would seek us out and find us
And color all the words we say

And hearts would come alive
Instead of breaking
No one would believe that a lie was true
Angels would appear

Children would be cherished
Hope would never parish
Faith would not betray

Was it the spell of Paris,

Linda Eder,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Linda Eder,"Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade!
Don't tell me not to fly, I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill, it's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade?

[Chorus]
I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it!
Hat, sir?
I guess I didn't make it!

But whether I'm a rose of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion
A cinder on the shiny apple of its eye
I gotta fly once
I gotta try once
Only can die once
""Right, sir?""

Oh, love is juicy, juicy and you see
I gotta have my bite, sir!
Get ready for me, love 'cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade!
 
I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang
Eye on the target and wham
One shot, one gunshot, and bam!
Hey world, here I am!

Linda Eder,"I wonder if when all is done
Anyone heard my voice
But from the start we have no choice
Our journeys just begin

I'll never know if I was right
Did I fight hard enough?
When the battles grew too rough
Should I have given in?

But here I stand and swear to you
I did the best that I could do...

I know my voice was just a whisper
But someone may have heard
There were nights the moon above me stirred,
And let me grab a hold
My hands have touched the gold

My hearts been driven by extremes
Blind with dreams, tight with fear
But still God knows that I was hear
And I was so alive

And now I lay the past to rest
For in the end I did my best

You have to live the life you're given
And never close your eyes
You hold on, and stare into the sky,
And burn against the cold
For any moment, you might find the gold!

And there was joy
Through it all
And I am standing tall

I know my voice was just a whisper
But someone must have heard
There were nights the moon above me stirred,
And let my light take hold
I'd rode across that sky
And once I touched the gold

Here in my own two hands
I once had the gold",Gold [From Camille Claudel],2003

Linda Eder,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question of pause To be willing to march
Into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star!



",The Impossible Dream [From Man of La Mancha],2003
Linda Eder,"A new life, what I wouldn't give
To have a new life
One thing I have learned as I go through life
Nothing is for free along the way

A new start, that's the thing I need
To give me new heart
Half a chance in life to find a new part
Just a simple role that I can play

A new hope, something to convince me
To renew hope
A new day, bright enough to help me
Find my way

A new chance, one that maybe has
A touch of romance
Where can it be
The chance for me?

A new dream, I have one I know
That very few dream
I would like to see that overdue dream
Even though it never may come true

A new love though I know
There's no such thing as true love
Even so although I never knew love
Still I feel that one dream is my due

A new world, this one thing I want
To ask of you world
Once before it's time to say adieu, world
One sweet chance to prove the cynics wrong

A new life more and more I'm sure
As I go through life, just to play the game
And to pursue life, just to share it's pleasures and belong
That's what I've been here for all along
Each day's a brand new life
",A  New Life [From Jekyll & Hyde],2003
Linda Eder,"Some people can get a thrill
Knitting sweaters and sitting still
That's ok for some people
Who don't know they're alive
Some people can thrive and bloom
Living life in the living room
That's perfect for some people 
Of one hundred and five
But I at least gotta try
When I think of
All the sights that I gotta see
All the places I gotta play
All the things I gotta be at
Come on Papa
What do you say?
Some people can be content
Playing bingo and paying rent
That's peachy for some people 
For some hum-drum people to be
But some people ain't me!
I had a dream
A wonderful dream, Papa
All about June in the Orpheum Circuit
Gimme a chance and I know I can work it! I had a dream
Just as real as can be, Papa
There I was in Mr. Orpheum's office
And he was saying to me
""Rose, get yourself some new orchestrations
New routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby
Photographs in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time
You'll be being booked in the big time!""
Oh, what a dream!
A wonderful dream, Papa!
And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, Papa
That's what he said
Only eighty-eight bucks
Goodbye to blueberry pie!
Good riddance to all the socials I had to go to
All the lodges I had to play
All the shuners I said hello to
Hey L.A. I'm comin' your way!

Got the dream, Yeah, but not the guts
That's living for some people 
For some hum-drum people

But not Rose!!!",Some People [From Gypsy],2003
Linda Eder,"The moon is afraid to come out tonight
They'll be no dinners by candlelight
There is an aura of doom in the air
And a storm out at sea

Every Picasso tonight is in blue
The currency is plummeting down in Peru
And it won't come back
'Til you come back to me

The world's gone mad
Since we have parted
And mother nature doesn't like
What she can see

She's feeling sad
And brokenhearted
But she'll be feeling better
If you come back to me

Tonight all the winners have learned how to lose
Even Chikofsky is playin' the blues
And the hole in the sky
Makes the winter a balmy 103

The papers are sayin' that love is passe
Oh, it's so striking but not for the pay
They won't write
'Til you come back to me

It's clear to see
We were mistaking
Shakespeare himself could not
Create such tragedy

Don't you agree
The first steps must be taken?
But we can fix this mess
When you come back to me

Tonight every song is a bit out of tune
The cow tried to jump but crashed into the moon
You have to admit it cannot be too soon
'Til we're in harmony

For what really matters, we never can learn
Spring will arrive so the birds can return
But they won't come back
'Til you come back to me

They won't come back
'Til you come back to me
They're staying put
'Til you come back to me

Tonight every song is a bit out of tune
The cow tried to jump but crashed into the moon
You have to admit it cannot be too soon
'Til we're in harmony

For what really matters, we never can learn
Spring will arrive so the birds can return
But they won't come back
'Til you come back to me

They won't come back
'Til you come back to me
They're staying put
'Til you come back to me

Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

Linda Eder,"If he never said hello
If his eyes had never smiled at me
What did he find inside my heart
That made him take a chance
Did he know what I was feeling
Could it be that he was lonely
Something between us had begun
Something so beautiful
Something that's started with hello
Now memories are filling me with pictures of the past
Foolish me hoping love would last
And even now I still can feel
The way he looked at me
The way he looked at me

If he never said forever
I would have never known love
If he never said hello
I'll never know goodbye

Linda Eder,"It's not a whispered word or a pretty phrase
It's not a touch it's not a gaze
It's not how we hold on but how we grow
It's standing by and letting go

It's not the beauty of making someone yours
Love sets us free
Loves opens doors
Love sends move on

Stand on your own
Love knows when someone else meets to rise and walk along
Life pass the change
Don't wonder why

He needs to feel the light of the open sky
If we hold on too tight
How can a dream take flight
Open your arms

And let him fly
It's not just pulling someone very near
It's having faith instead of fear
You can't hold someone back when his dream calls

Love is a hole that has no walls
Yes he may disappear
There's no way to know
You take that chance
You let him go

[Chorus]

Go find your dream
Be who you are
I want much for you
Than I wish upon a star

Move from my side
I will not cry
If you remember me
Love can never die

Love lets the life break through
Now love will help me too
Open my arms and let him fly
It's not it's not goodbye

Someday you'll fly high

Got no time for trouble keep away
But I've got one big trouble
And I don't know what to do

I think I want you think I will

Dreams to linger within you,
Close your eyes and we'll ride my carousel.
I'll sing you stories of 

Lovers whose love used 
To fill me.
And the lovers who will be. 
For, you see, love is one thing I do well.

Come let's believe love can be just as sweet as it seems.
Let's live on dreams...
In my dreams such beautiful lovers have found me.
Story book lovers surround me. 

Nothing is real, but I'm flying,
Sighing: Where, where, where is my story book
Ending?
Why does my golden pretending

Leave me with nothing to hold...but
My dreams?
Oh is it only in dreams that we find out ideal love?
Are there lovers with real love? 

If you know how to feel love, show me how.
Ah, but my prince, if you can't be as sweet as you seem, 
I'd rather dream!
Come and wake me! Come be the love I can hold now.

Storybook love leaves me cold now.
Show me the way to stop dreaming! 
There is only one perfect story book ending. 
That is the end of pretending. 
That is the moment I say: Love me now!

When I look at you
What I always see

Still I can hear him laugh
Even though that melody plays on
He's gone

When I look at you
He is standing there
I can almost breathe him in
like summer in the air
Why do you smile his smile
That heaven I'd forgotten eases through
In you

If you could look at me once more
With all the love you felt before
If you and I could only dance into the past
And find that love we knew
I'll never take my eyes away from you

When I look at you
He is touching me
I would reach for him
But who can hold a memory?
And love isn't everything
This moonlight on the bed will melt away someday

Oh, you were once that someone
Who I followed like a star
And suddenly you changed
And now I don't know who you are
Or could it be that I never really knew you from the start

Linda Eder,"I peer through windows
watch life go by.
Dream of tomorrow
and wonder why
the past is holding me
keeping life at bay.
I wander lost in yesterday.
Wanting to fly
but scared to try.
But if someone like you
found someone like me
then suddenly
nothing would ever be the same.
My heart would take wing and I'd feel so alive
If someone like you found me.
So many secrets
I long to share.
All I have needed 
is someone there.
To help me see a world
I've never seen before.
A love to open every door.
To set me free,
so I can soar.
But if someone like you
found someone like me
then suddenly 
nothing would ever be the same.
There'd be a new way to live
a new life to love.
If someone like you found me.
But if someone like you
found someone like me
then suddenly
nothing would ever be the same.
My heart would take wing and I'd feel so alive
If someone like you loved me
loved me
loved me.

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

Linda Eder,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost",Ghost,2008

Linda Feller,"Ich war seid fast acht Stunden schon auf der Autobahn 
War ganz kurz vor meinem Ziel und hielt mich mächtig ran 
Die Sonne sie stand schon sehr tief als ich zur Ausfahrt kam 
Der Diesel dröhnte neben mir mein Funkgerät war an 
Als daraus die Stimme eines kleinen Jungen kam 
Er sagte nur Kanal 14 ist hier irgendwer? Wenn dann ruf 
Mich doch zurück und sprich mit Teddybär 
Bis zur Stadt war’s nicht mehr weit ich kam ganz gut voran 
Ich nahm das Mikro in die Hand und sagte ganz spontan 
Hey ich rufe Teddybär wo ist der junge Mann? Ich bin auf 
Deiner Welle kannst du mich verstehen? 
Es wurde still auf dem Kanal ich wollt schon weiterdrehen 
Da fragte mich der Junge Fahrer bist du auch noch dran? 
Ich sagte JA und da fing er mir zu erzählen an 
Jeden Tag von früh bis spät schalt ich den Kasten ein 
Sitz im Rollstuhl kann nicht gehen und bin hier ganz allein 
Und meine Mutter arbeitet sie sagt dass muss so sein 
Denn Daddy starb vor einem Jahr auf dieser Autobahn 
Er war ein Fahrer so wie Du bis er dann nicht mehr kam 
Sie sagt mir oft wir schaffen es und tut als wenn nichts wär 
Doch jede Nacht hör ich sie weinen Ich weiß sie hat’s sehr schwer 
Und während er so redete da fiel es mir doch auf 
Kein anderer war zu dieser Zeit auf Kanal 14 drauf 
Er sagte Dieses Funkgerät von Daddy gehört jetzt mir 
Es ist der schönste Zeitvertreib mit einem so wie dir 
Auch Daddy sprach von unterwegs genauso wie jetzt du 
Und eines Tages sagte er mein Junge hör mir zu einmal

Da nehm ich dich mit raus doch leider Wurde nichts mehr raus 
Ich hörte die Enttäuschung die aus diesen Worten Klang 
Ich war längst stehngeblieben das packte mich doch an 
Denn all das ging mir zu Herzen Ich pfiff auf Job und Zeit 
Alle konnten warten nur dieser Junge nicht tut mir leid 
Ich sagte Teddybär wo wohnst du wo liegt deine Station? 
Was ich zu tun hatte dass wusste ich längst schon 
Nur dieser kleine Funker der ahnte nichts davon 
Er gab mir die Adresse sagte lebe wohl und 
Irgendwann vielleicht bist du wieder hier dann wär es schön 
Wenn mich dein Ruf erreicht 
Dann war es Still und ich gab Gas Mit 80 in die Stadt 
Die letzte Kurve ich war da Ich glaubte nicht was ich da sah 
Da standen 18 LKWs Ich war den Tränen nah 
Sie hatten alles mitgehört und fuhrn ihn hin und her 
Ja einer nach dem andren fuhr eine Runde mit Teddybär 
18 mal die Straße runter und 18 mal auch rauf 
Ich war ganz als letzter dran und trug ihn auch wieder hinauf 
Ich hab noch nie ein Kind gesehen dass so restlos glücklich war 
Und seine Augen strahlten es war einfach wunderbar 
Er sagte Fahrer glaube mir dass war eine Schau 
Ich fang dich wieder einmal ein dass weiß ich ganz genau 
Und er hielt meine Hand die ganze Zeit schon 
Ich schluckte und sagte Ist schon gut mein Sohn 
Dann fuhr ich los und mein Gerät dass war noch auf Empfang 
Als auf einmal die Stimme einer Frau erklang Sie sagte 
Und man merkte es das Sprechen fiel ihr schwer 
Hier ist Kanal 14 hier spricht Mutter Teddybär 
Den schönsten Tag in seinem Leben habt ihr meinem Kind gegeben 
Niemals mehr kann ich vergessen wie ihr zu meinem Jungen ward 
Ich danke euch 
Und allzeit gute Fahrt",Ruf Teddybär Eins-Vier,2004

From deep in the Delta on the Louisiana shore

Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Some say it came from Memphis down in Tennessee
Or it drifted in from Georgia about 1953
Just as long as it's greasy, as long as it's fast
As long as it's pumpin' honey, it's gonna last

It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Through the Carolinas on them dirt red roads
Burnin like a fire runnin' wild in the woods
From Arkansas to Texas, it sounds so good

It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Take a ride down the river, you'll see just what I mean
The juke joint's jumpin, when that cat goes on
The whole place is shakin', there's a something goin' on

I never had to sweat to get paid

Gypsy girl, you've got it made

All them uh and them uh
And them uh, uh, uh
Ain't gonna spell success
Me, I uh, and I uh
And I uh, uh, uh
But I do it with finesse

Dressy Tessie Tura
Is so much more then demurer
Than all them other ladies because
You gotta get a gimmick
If you wanna get applause

Do something special
Anything special
Do something special
Anything special

You're more than just a mimic
When you got a gimmick
Take a look how different we are

If you wanna make it
Twinkle while you shake it
If you wanna grind it
Wait till you refined it

If you wanna pump it
Pump it with a trumpet
Get yourself a gimmick
And you too can be a star

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?

Day by day.
They look so natural together,
Just like two newlyweds should be.

Linda Lawson,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1960

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

That you can't see

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll

Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

Mamunia... 
It might have been a bright blue day 
But rainclouds had to come this way 
They're watering everything that they can see. 

A seed is waiting in the earth 
For rain to come and give him free, 
So the next time you see L.A. rain clouds 
Don't complain, it rains for you. 

So lay down your umbrellas 
Strip off your plastic macs. 
You've never felt the rain my friend, 
Till you've felt it running down your back 

So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad 
Don't complain, it rains for you. 
The next time you see L.A. rain clouds 
Don't complain it rains for you and me.

When your light is on the blink
You never think of worrying
What's the use of worrying?

When your bus has left the stop
You'd better drop your hurrying
What's the use of hurrying?

Leave me alone Mrs. Vandebilt
I've got plenty of time of my own

What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?

Ho, hey ho

What's the use of worrying?

What's the use of anything?

Ho, hey ho

Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho

When your pile is on the wane
You don't complain of robbery
Run away don't bother me

What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of anything?

Leave me alone Mrs. Washington
I've done plenty of time on my own

What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?

Inch by Inch I sink below

And I love, I love, I love
All my bad company
And I know, I know, I know
that's what's meant to be
So there's nothing let for me to say.

Stoned and demented
Walking through the walls
When I banged my head I slowly fell

Sad but delighted
Swimming in my well
I guess I'm going straight to Hell

And I love, I love, I love
All my bad company
And I know, I know, I know
That's what's meant to be
And I love, I love, I love
All my bad company

So there's nothing let for me to say
No there's nothing let for me to say

Linda Perry,"Have you been told
About the machine man
His leather gloves
Hide his machine hands

In every dream
In sleep I ever had
I am awoke
By the machine man

Have you been told
About the machine man
He watches me
With eyes as cold as sand

And when I sleep
I feel him stroke my hand
I am awoke by the machine man

In Flight
Learning what I am
Feeling like a bluebird
Flying away

I love the drops of rain
Smiling on my feathers
Guiding my way

It's treating me so kindly
So far to go
So I flew unto a tree
Gather inspiration

Happy to meet

And finish our direction

Linda Perry,"This is not the way it's
Supposed to be
Spend my day in fear of all
It sets me free

For what I do and say
I can hold myself to blame
But the sure remains the same
Will success fail me?
Will it make me free?
What they tell me I should want?
Is it what I need?
Hey Mom, hey Dad
The story went
Round the burning wheels of faith
It pays the rent
Hey sister, hey brother

Choose between the win and lose
But what's the use?
Will success fail me?
Will it make me free?

It looks like your gonna cry,
Is everything alright?
Are your days
Dropping you in a hole
No signals no signs
No reasons or rhymes
And just when you thought you'd be down on your knees
I'll say baby come with me please
And we'll just
Fly away
Fly away
Don't you need to get higher
Baby baby baby
I wanna get close to you
But I'm so afraid
Honey, I'm so afraid
That one day you'll wake up and realize your wasting time, your sweet time
When I pick up the phone
You're not alone
And there I'll be standing wondering what's wrong
I'll say oh baby take me along
And we will
Fly away

Still I curl up right under the bed

A borrowed dream or a superstar?

I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

That you were the best girl I've ever had

It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,

How did the countess slide underneath the door

We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way

On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away
It's time to move on or go down with the ship

Linda Purl,"Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your feet, she's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort, please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say ""When""

Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Linda Ransom,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1999

Go love, open up the door you'll see the winds aren't warm anymore
The birds we heard all summer long were chased away by winter's storms
Oh how you love me! Sweet summer blue and gold. Will you stay with me? Long winter's grey and cold

It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind

I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down
Don't get upset, I am not pleading
Or saying I can't forget you
Well it don't even matter who you awaken with tomorrow
Cause baby you've been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
Oh you know I won't be next to you
You know I won't be near
I'll just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind

It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind

Baby you've been on my mind

You got a restless look
Said goodbye in the same old way
Like I knew you would

You remember, do you remember
Everything we said
Promise made with a kiss for sure
Like a book I read

It's about time you came back anyway
It's been a long long time
Been alone most every day
You've been on my mind

I always wondered where you went
To find some peace of mind
You never seemed to give much thought

In the things that you never seemed to say?
How many times have I read those last lines
And wondered why it ended this way?

Words of goodbye and all those loving lines
I must have been blind
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name
Both have changed with the passing of time

How you would write about the bright lights
And your words always clouded up my eyes
How you would write about the bright lights
It's a wonder that I never realized

Our race was run now and another's just begun
I must have been blind
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name
Both have changed with the passing of time

When your letters stopped the tears that I fought
How they came in the flood of memories
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought
How they ran like the rivers to the seas

Each sunny day, you slip further away
I must have been blind
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name
Both have changed with the passing of time

Way down south in New Orleans just a-lookin' for a dream

He was there on that night said for you I know I'm right
I'll be with you until my race is run
He walked into my life with his cold evil eyes
And with the length of his mind, he dark the sun

Well, my memory cannot speak and, oh Lord, I'm feeling weak
But I blame it on the fact that I was young
Though I know it may sound strange, there is no way I can change
What my fate has laid out for me now is done

It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act a little girl

Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried
Ah but women like Louise well they get by

Yes and everybody thought it kinda sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd always put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Linda Ronstadt,"Now Matthew was a country boy until one day he found
That cheatin' folks was easier than plowin' his daddy's ground
He left his home back in Ohio, bound for Chicago's town
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back

A bullet cut him down
And as he lay there dying
He said ""Will I see my Ohio?""
In my reply I lied a bit 

And said I did not know
Now Jim McCall he was meek and small
And to become a man
He'd have to build himself up tall 

With fancy folks and land
He threw some stones at honest friends
And he got himself these things
His children left him and he sneered 


""That's what my kindness brings""
And on the south side he got lost
He asked me where to go
In my reply I lied a bit 

And said I did not know
Yes Miss Lazy Susan called me up
She heard I stole the show
In my reply I lied a bit

And said I did not know
In my reply I lied a bit and said I did not know",In My Reply,1974

And my poor mother worked the mines

That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

I know that time is gonna take its toll
We're gonna pay for the love that we stole
Ah it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
Ah but our love keeps coming on strong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday

And you find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by

Linda Ronstadt,"Well I spent my whole lifetime
In a world where the sunshine
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round
I squandered emotions
On the slightest of notions
And the first easy loving I found
But soon all the good times
The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away

There's times when I trembled
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face

Oh Lord if you're listening
I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
Throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away

Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away",Keep Me from Blowing Away,1974

With blood on both my hands

And now we're both too weak to stand
You think you're gonna live forever
And somehow find me there
But you'll be wearing golden wings
And fall right through the air

One day a mother went to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done

She did not bring to him a parole or pardon
She brought no silver, no pomp or style
It was a halo bright sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile

She left a smile you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those walls around you could never change her
You were her baby and e'er will be

She did not bring to him a parole or pardon

You get one too

Can't stop saying it

Or so rough you wouldn't know its name
Shy and wild like a runaway child

Linda Ronstadt,"Love will abide, take things in stride
Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side 
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time 

Wait for the day 
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause? 
Living in the memory of a love that never was 
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine 
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time","Long, Long Time",1977

Ramblin' round your city
Ramblin' round your town
But I never see a friend I know
As I go ramblin' round boys
As I go ramblin' round

The peach trees they are loaded
The branches are bending down
Well I pick 'em all day for a dollar, Lord
As I go ramblin' round boys
As I go ramblin' round

Sometimes the fruit gets rotten
Falls down on the ground
Well there's a hungry mouth for every peach
As I go ramblin' round boys
As I go ramblin' round

My father hoped that I would be
Someone of high renown
But I am just a refugee
As I go ramblin' round boys

Ramblin' round your city

There's no time to find you now

And your towers are turning
I've gotta leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehow

Rock me on the water
Sister, won't you soothe my fevered brow
Ooh, rock me on the water
Gotta get down to the sea somehow

The road is filled with homeless souls
Every woman child and man
Who have no idea where they will go
But they'll help you if they can

Now everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow
Well, the fires are raging hotter and hotter
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

It's there your hope must lie
There's a seabird above you gliding in one place
Like Jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang onto that gospel cloud
When my life is over
Gonna stand for the father
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

Rock me on the water
Sister, won't you soothe my fevered brow
Ooh, rock me on the water

Maybe I'll remember how

Linda Ronstadt,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

With their sails afloat

Maybe he's right
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be
Nobody knows when the truth goes by
But everyone tells me that he's happy

Maybe he's gone and found some love
I want to see it for myself
Everyone says just to let him alone
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so

Just when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks alright again
Then the clouds fill the skies
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you dear
For to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care
But sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win


And then when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
The clouds fill the sky's
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

No sometimes you just can't win.......

Rise up over the Rockies 
And down on into California
Out to where but the rocks again

Let the sun rise over the redwoods
I'll rise with it till I rise no more

To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too


",Lush Life,1984
Linda Ronstadt,"Sweetheart I love you
Think the world of you
But I'm afraid you don't care for me

Why do you act like you do

You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me
Gee honey it seems to me
You love to see me crying

I don't know why I stay home
Each night when you say you'll phone
You don't and I'm left alone
Singing the blues and sighing

You treat me coldly each day of the year
You always scold me whenever somebody is near dear
It must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't for can't you see

So magnificent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who took me up to the skies

Won't you tell me where my love can be
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed

Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

To a blossom-covered lane
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night
Wonderful music

Faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

All you can count on is the raindrops

You may as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

The world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky
Above the ring I love so well

Gone are the tinsel and gold

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die

There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

I've had enough, I've had enough

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me

Linda Ronstadt,"This is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about 1958.

There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand

[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!

Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.

When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.

Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part
