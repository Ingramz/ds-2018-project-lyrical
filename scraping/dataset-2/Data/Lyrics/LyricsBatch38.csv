Charlie Daniels,"He blew in town at midnight
And he didn't mean to stay
And then he found her
Just at closing time at the Alamo Cafe

And the way he smiled and carried on
He kinda made her day
So by the time that she left
He left with her

And she let him borrow money
And she let him drive her car
She didn't really trust him
But she done and gone too far

When the midnight moon is shining
When it's shining down the way
Well, if he blew in on the midnight wind
He may never pass this way again

She knew down in her heart
That he would only stay awhile
But sometimes she was a woman
And sometimes she was a child

Then just about the time
That she was learning how to smile
One Tuesday night
He came up missing

And sometimes now she thinks
She hears his footsteps cross the floor
But it's just that midnight wind
Howling around the door

When the midnight moon is shining
When it's shining down the way
Well, if he blew in on the midnight wind
He may never pass this way again

When the midnight moon is shining
When it's shining down the way
Well, if he blew in on the midnight wind
He may never pass this way again",Midnight Wind,1989
Charlie Daniels,"I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck I reckon that I am
But there's things going on
That make me mad down to the core.

I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder'n hell and I ain't gonna take it no more.

We tell our kids to just say no
Then some panty waist judge lets a drug dealer go
Slaps him on the wrist and then he turns him back out on the town.

Now if I had my way with people sellin' dope
I'd take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down

Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The good book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a Simple Man.

Now I'm the kinda man that'd not harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin in my house
I've got twelve gauge shotgun waiting on the other side

So don't go pushing me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
So if you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by

As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the raping and the killing and the child abuse
And I've got a way to put an end to all that mess

Just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

You know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a simple man",Simple Man,1990
Charlie Daniels,"Hey, I've got a guitar, I've got a fiddle
I'll sing the low part, I'll sing the middle
Rosin up the bow and let's pick a little
Got a fiddle and guitar band.

I like old songs, I like the new
I like the glad songs, I like the blues
Well, we'll play them and another note too
With the fiddle and guitar band.

Standing on the sidewalk singin' up a storm
You ain't seen ? till the day you were born ?

Charlie Daniels,"What will you do when you get lonely
With nobody waitin' by your side?
You've been running and hiding much to long
You know it's just your foolish pride

[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all --- my love's in vain

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",Layla,1991
Charlie Daniels,"In the heat of the battle
To the head army there stepped a man
He said, ""I've been to the top of the liberty
And I've looked over the promised land""

He had no fear of death or evil
His skin was black and his name was King
He said I may not get there with you
But put your faith in God and let freedom ring

There was a tyrant strong and mighty
And he built his self a wall
He said, ""This wall's gonna stand forever
No power on Earth is gonna make it fall""

But then the winds of change they started blowing
Like a free bird on the wing
And then the wall fell down with a sound like thunder
Let the free bird fly and let freedom ring

(Let freedom ring)
Throughout the northland out across the frozen Tundra
To the land of the midnight sun and the Eskimo

(Let freedom ring)
From Albuquerque across the sea to Greece and Turkey
And from Halifax down south to Mexico

(Let freedom ring)
From Carolina round the world to Indochina
From Seattle to Mobile and Abilene

(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring

Innocent blood was shed for freedom
In a faraway place called Tiennemen Square
'Cause the heavy hand of cruel oppression
Is so much more than a man can bear

But you can't chain a man forever
And your guns they don't mean a thing
'Cause they'll rise again in the cause of justice
Give the power to the people and let freedom ring

(Let freedom ring)
From Minnesota across the plains to North Dakota
And from Kennebunkport out to Kalamazoo

(Let freedom ring)
From Rome to Reno and from Tokyo to Moscow
And from Barcelona, Spain to Kathmandu

(Let freedom ring)
From Madagascar and from Berlin to Alaska
And from Liverpool to Perth to Aberdeen

(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring

Let's give thanks to God our Father
The author of our liberty
Gave us this land to protect and cherish
It's the home of the brave and it's the land of the free

Oh America, we love you
Sweet land of hope of thee we sing
And with our life's blood we will protect you
Let the eagle fly and let freedom ring

Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let it ring, let it ring
Let it ring, let it ring
Let freedom ring",Let Freedom Ring,1991
Charlie Daniels,"Well, I went down to Nashville
In 1973
And they won't nobody in Music City
Wanted anything to do with me

They said, ?Boy you sure dress funny
And you just don't fit our crowd
And your music's weird, your hair's too long
And you play that guitar way too loud?

I said, ""Yeah, I know, I'm different
I know, I'm not the same
And you may drive a big Cadillac car
But I ain't gonna play your game?

And you can put me down in this guitar town
And I ain't gonna be afraid
'Cause I'm a proud walkin', slow talkin'
Hard headed, high steppin' genuine renegade

Well, I ain't afraid to tell you what's on my mind
I just ain't the bashful type
I go all the way for the U.S.A.
'Cause I love them stars and stripes

I ain't never been scared of nothin'
And I'm a renegade to the bone
So if you're looking for trouble better bring you some help
I'm a little bit more than you can handle alone

I'm mighty proud of Dixie
I'm just full of Southern pride
I'm a catfish connoisseur
And I know, I'm countryfied

I get an ornery streak sometimes when I speak
But I guess, it's just the price I paid
'Cause I'm a hard drivin' survivin'
Four wheelin', straight dealin' genuine renegade

And you can put me down in this guitar town
I ain't gonna be afraid
'Cause I'm a proud walkin', slow talkin'
Hard headed, high steppin' genuine renegade",Renegade,1991
Charlie Daniels,"Well if this old fiddle could talk
If this old fiddle could sing
Man if this old fiddle could only talk
It could tell you some wondrous things
Talk to me fiddle
Tell me about when you came across the sea
In the hands of a jewish immigrant who was longing to be free
And you were part of his life for forty years
Through times both lean and fat
And he raised his family and lived out his days
In a New York tenement flat
Talk to me fiddle
Tell me about how that cajun fiddlin' man
Found you in a pawn shop and took you back down
To the Louisiana bayou land
You knew his wife and you knew his kids
And you watched his family grow
And you played your heart out caju'n style
At the Louisiana Fais Do Do
Well talk to me fiddle
Then a big shot yankee gambler found you down in New Orleans
And took you up the river on the Mississippi Queen
Then there came the day that you were all
That he had left to lose
And a black man won you in a poker game
And taught you how to play the blues
Talk to me fiddle
Then a hobo from Biloxi found you living in the rain
And he got himself a free ride on a west-bound cattle train
And you got off in Texas
Where they play that western swing
Where the people do the two-step
And old Bob Wills was the king
Talk to me fiddle
You've been bouncing around America from sea to shining sea
Now your traveling days are over fiddle 'cause you belong to me",Talk to Me Fiddle,1991
Charlie Daniels,"You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
That day has come and gone but you're still away from home
I'm walking the floor over you

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

Now darling, you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought you would love me and you always would be mine
You went away and left me here with troubles on my mind

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you",Walking the Floor Over You,1992
Charlie Daniels,"When we dance together my world's in disguise it's a fairyland tale that come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you

My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone the moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and on
And I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas",Waltz Across Texas,1992
Charlie Daniels,"Well the train to Grinder's Switch is runnin' right on time
And the Tucker boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
People down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on his red guitar

[Chorus]
So gather round gather round children
Get down well just get down children
Get loud well you can be loud and be proud
And you can be proud here
Be proud to a rebel 'cause the south's gonna do it again

Elvin Bishop's sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin' but he sure can play
And there's Z-Z Top and you can't forget
That old brother Willie's gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' barefoot Jerry and the C-D-B

[Chorus]

And again, yes it is",The South's Gonna Do It,1993
Charlie Daniels,"Me and my buddy got us a wild hair
And figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money and a whole lot of show
And with Hank Junior blaring on the radio
We got a tank full of gas and we was on our way

We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barrelling' down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light was on our tail
He said, ""You were doin' 60 in a 45
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again, I'm gonna slap you in the county jail""

We said, ""Thank you sir, you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice""
And we were Southbound and down with the wind blowing in our faces
We kept on rolling and pretty soon
The radio was cooking out a haggard tune
And we were pulling into Houston and checking out all the places

I was feeling dry and I said, ""I think
We ought to stop and get ourselves a drink""
Old Jim said, ""Yeah 'cause we got time to kill""
We kept on rolling and I seen this spot
We pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called, 'The Cloud Nine Bar and Grill'

We walked through the door and the place was jammed
The lights were low, they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired feller singing about suicide
I said, ""Jim, this ain't our kind of place
He said, ""Well, let's just have one round anyway""
So against my better judgment we walked on inside

Went up to the bar and we sat down
This feller walked up and said, ""I'll buy this round""
And he sat down on the barstool next to Jim
He looked like a girl but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him

I said, ""Jim, this ain't our kind of bar
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
'Cause there's gonna be trouble, ain't no sense in taking a chance""
We was getting up, getting ready to leave
When somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve
And this good looking girl, she was asking my buddy to dance

I said, ""Jim, don't do it, there's something missing
There's fellers dancing and fellers kissing
There's a feller in high heeled shoes wearing panty hose""
He said, ""Partner, I just can't turn this down
You just go over there and have one more round
I'll dance with the lady and we'll get on down the road""

So he walked away and left me alone
But this funny looking feller kept coming on
And he was making me mad with some of the things he said
Then he put his hand on my knee
I said, ""If you don't get your paw off me
I'm gonna locate your nose around the other side of your head""

He said, ""I love it when you get that fire in your eye
I said, ""Well, partner try this on for size""
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me, I said, ""This is the end""
But where I come from, we don't give up without a fight

They were screaming and yelling and scratching and clawing
I was punching and hitting and kicking and pawing
I was holding my own, 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come running up out of the blue
And that gal he was with, come running up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe

I grabbed her by the hair it came off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
And old Jim just got sick right there on the floor
He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick, made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fighting our way to the door

Man, we lit out of there in that Chevrolet
I put in on the floor and it stayed that way
We was going' down the highway doing about a hundred and ten
We were headed for home and we was getting nearer
Then a red light came on the rear view mirror
And that same blame cop was pulling us over again

Now I'm sitting' here in this county jail
I had to call my Daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson that I never will forget again
I've done give up drinking', I've give up bars
And running around the country in souped up cars
I'm going back where the women are women and the men are men",Uneasy Rider 88,1993
Charlie Daniels,"Well the party started early, 
About a quarter-to-three
Just a few close friends, 
Charlie, Troy, and me
We just got started when somebody asked
How long you think this party's gonna last?

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

Well the next door neighbors 
Started raising a fuss
Said you had a party 
And you didn't call us
I said put on your dancing shoes and come along
We'll be here till the cows come home

And that's all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

We'll be jumping through the windows 
And sneaking down the halls
Dancing on the ceiling, 
Dancing on the wall
The last thing I remember 
'fore the lights went out
I jumped up on the table and I started to shout

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

Charlie Daniels,"Every night downtown on the streets of the city
When the midnight hour is comin' on
You'll see her come slinkin' down the alley in a tight dress
She'll walk them streets till the break of dawn
Well she'll slip away fore the sun starts rising
When the daylight comes she's gonna be long gone

Don't you ever come down here looking for trouble
Cause trouble is the ladies' middle name
You may think you're bad but let me tell you somethin'
There ain't no way you're gonna play her game
She'll make you feel like a fool with a hole in your pocket
Like you've been run over by a choo choo train

She purrs and she growls and she rambles and she prowls
And she's evil and she's mean like a misery machine
She's a little bit of this and a whole lot of that like an alley cat

Better stay away from the midnight lady
She'll leave you standing on the corner with a mess of the blues
She's an accident looking for a place to happen
She'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
If she ever gets them claws into you
She'll turn you every which a way but loose

And she purrs and she growls...
[ guitar ]
Well she purrs and she growls...

Well let me tell you somethin' Jack.
The next time I go on a shopping trip, and take somethin' off of the rack,

Charlie Daniels,"Almost all of my life every day and every night
The only thing that I could think of
Was doing all I could do to find me a true blue
A foxy little lady to love
I looked uptown downtown looking all around town
Searching and trying so hard
Looking for the right face but looking in the wrong place
I should have looked in my back yard
Cause I found everything I was a looking for
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door

She went away to cellege to get herself some knowledge
She just got back a month ago
She had changed a whole lot I found out she was not
That little girl I used to know
As little freckled faced tomboy who used to make a lot of noise
Running around the neighborhood
Was sitting on the front porch in a pair of short shorts
And buddy she was looking good
I got what I want I'll never ask for more
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door

We're gonna move way out to a little biddy town
Where the living is nice and slow
Where they ain't got nothing but a general store
One street and a picture show
I hope we have a little boy gonna be my pride and joy
Raise him by the golden rule
Watch him while he grows tall fishing poles and football
Apple pie and Sunday school

So goodbye bright lights single bars and wild nights
Goodbye all you partying girls
You can't find what I've got in honky tonks and night spots
And I wouldn't trade it for the world
Tell the boys at the hideaway I hope they had a nice day
Tell them all I said goodbye
I would've dropped around but I'm going out of town
And besides I've got a ring to buy
So long old friend I'm headed out the door
With my blue eyed ever loving pretty little girl next door the girl next door

I got all I want I'll never ask for more
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door I said the girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door

Oh Juanita I dream about you near bout every night

You make me know everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Charlie Daniels,"Down near the village of old San Miguel
In a far away place by the sea
Lived Maria Consuela Manuel
A lady of high born degree
And she was sixteen a proud woman child
And I was a cowboy rambunctious and wild
But we fell in love by the tall mission bell
That stands in the village of old San Miguel

Her father was master of all he surveyed
As rich as a king on his throne
When he found out about us he flew into a rage
And told me to leave her alone
He threatened my life and told all his man
This gringo must never see Maria again
But I found a way and I sent her a note
And I still remember all the words that I wrote

Meet me Maria in the cool of the evening
We'll slip away into the night
We'll cross the border at Nuevo Laredo
And together we'll start a new life
There's nothing here but heartaches and tears
And I don't even feel like a man
I'll saddle the horses and wait by the old Spanish trail
We'll leave our troubles behind us in old San Miguel

She slipped out of the shadows and into my arms
As the clock in the village struck ten
We crept through the alleys to the north side of town
And rode into the night like the wind
A full moon was shinin' the desert was still
Then I saw the vacaros ridin' over the hill
The rifle shots rang out the horses went down
And I saw Maria lyin' still on the ground

I knew the bullets had been meant for me
And the riders were comin' on fast
As I held her I knew by the look in her eyes
That she'd soon be breathin' her last
I whispered a prayer to heaven above
Cause the good Lord has mercy on people in love
Then she closed her eyes forever more

Meet me Maria in the cool of the evening
We'll fly away into the night
We'll drift through the sky to sweet by and by
And together we'll find a new life
There's nothing here but heartaches and tears
And I don't even feel like a man
Wait in the moon light just over the old Spanish trail
We'll leave our troubles below us in old San Miguel

She's across between a diamond and a pearl
There ain't nobody like my sweet little country girl

I just love to hear her when she says good morning y'all

He said friend my old lady just threw me out and why I just don't know

I gave him my last twenty dollar bill and told him to go on home
And leave me alone

I was having a ball when the door flew open and who walked in but my ex
She said your alimony payments' way behind it's six months over due
And if you don't straighten this out right now I'm gonna call the law to you

He was in a bind
Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said boy let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
Cause I'm the best there's ever been

Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul.

The devil opened up his case
And he said I'll start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made a [sic] evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said well you're pretty good old son
Just sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done

He played Fire on the Mountain
Run boys, run

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Yeah we all got some boogie woogie in our soul
There's a little bit of Buddy Holly in every cowboy that I know
And even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll

It's just a hillbilly rhythm with a touch of the blues
It ain't nothin' but a simple little country song
Keep movin' to the music and you can't go wrong
Do the Tennessee two step all night long

They do it down in Memphis on a Saturday night
And them folks in Chattanooga think it's outta sight
Down in Music City it's all the rage
They do it on the Grand Old Opry stage
Even heard them talkin' bout it on Crook and Chase
They say it even makes the Smoky Mountains smoke
Like wildfire spreadin' everywhere you go
And it's a Tennessee two step they do it on a hardwood floor
I said the Tennessee two step one time you're gonna holler for more

You put your right foot forward and your left foot back
Start a little wiggle in your sacroiliac
And that's a Tennessee two step they do it on a hardwood floor

From the Mississippi River to the Cumberland Gap
They don't want to hear no rock any they don't want to hear no rap
Tennessee people like to do it up proud
They turn the lights down low the music up loud
Grab yourself a partner and follow the crowd
Everybody's smilin' cause they're feeling fine
Get yoursell together in a big long line

And then me and my brothers and sisters got on down to praisin' the lord, yeah

But Monday morning, my car wouldn't start, I didn't get to work till ten

There was people grumblin' and carrying on, I had to listing to all of that fuss
I'll tell you brother , it's just about enough to make a man want cuss
Went over in the corner, where there warn't nobody but me
I said thank you Jesus, because I'm not the man I used to be
I gonna make it, gonna make it through the week 'cause I know
Come Sunday morning, I'll be sitting on the very front row

Saturday evening, an old friend came by and said come on, let's go downtown
We'll find us a bar and we'll pick up some girls and do a little folling around
I said hold on buddy , I'm sure glad you came 'cause I got something I want you to see
Why don't you sit down here and let me tell you about what the lord has done for me
I said Jesus love you and he died got for your sins (Jesus loves you,died for your sins)
And if you let me, I'll be glad to lead you straight to him

No high-priced lawyers to appeal
Where the verdict is eternal
And you can't escape the verdict you're deserving

When your gold and silver's worthless
And you stand before the King
When your nightmares are reality
And there is no exit sign
And it's too late for repentance

And each new frightening morning brings
The children's cries, the cannon roar
More loudly than the day before
The wax of time is drippin' down
From both ends of that candle burning brightly
A mighty shout, a trumpet blast
When the last is first and the first is last
The world is hushed and time stands still
And the final chapter is fulfilled
The sky will part each knee will bow
To greet the awesome hour of His returning
When it's payback time
And the sheep are gathered in
When the roll is called up yonder
And eternity begins
When the wedding supper's ready
And the faithful called to dine
Who'll be sitting at the table

Charlie Daniels,"'Got on a plane in Fresco and got off in Vietnam.
I walked into a different world, the past forever gone.
I could have gone to Canada or I could have stayed in school.
But I was brought up differently. I couldn't break the rules.

Thirteen months and fifteen days, the last ones were the worst.
One minute I kneel down and pray And the next I stand and curse.
No place to run to where I did not feel that war.
When I got home I stayed alone and checked behind each door.

I am Still in Saigon in my mind!

The ground at home was covered with snow. And I was covered in sweat.

Damned if I know who I am. There was only one place I was sure
When I was 

Still in Saigon
Still in Saigon.
I am still in Saigon in my mind!

Every summer when it rains, I smell the jungle, I hear the planes.
I can't tell no one I feel ashamed. Afraid someday I'll go insane.

That's been ten long years ago and time has gone on by.
But now and then I catch myself
Eyes searchin' through the sky.

The lonely grain covered plains of Minnesota
From cabaret and camp meeting, and bayou and beer joint and good times and ghettos
I was born in a house of New Orleans traveling up the river on the North bound paddle leaders
I was nurtured in the Mississippi delta when seeds of the blues sprang forth in the rich black soil
I was there when Elvis learned to sing, when BB got his first guitar
I'm black and white and smooth and rough and hard and soft
I'm the roots of American music
And I'm always there just the local service
And when the chaff of trend and bad is swept aside

Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by

And you know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

And then the cloud about me hides the light of day
The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way

But jesus is a freind who watches day and and night

Charlie Daniels,"He was nobly born
Had a spanish bull's horn
And not one scar on his hansom face

He stood like a prince
And he had ever since
He had grandily walked into the place

Though the girls of Madrid
Tonight were forbid
For tomorrow he must fight once more

Before he left the bar
He would dance with them all
Cause he was El Toreador

The day of the feast
Was just a lie in the east
When he left Maria's warm bed

Her dark eyes said more
But he walked thru the door
Shaking cobwebs of dreams from his head

And later that day
As he knelt to pray
He said God grant me this nothing more

If it is the way
And I must die today
Let me die like a Toreador

The pageant he chose
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, round and round
On and on, all alone

The Plaza del Toros
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, 
Round and round
On and on, all alone

The shouts of ole
In the heat of the day
Rushed the hot blood to his Spanish heart

And the crowd held their breath
As he flirted with death
And the bull fighter's sword found it's mark

And trying to hide
The wound in his side
He walked from the ring standing tall

And a crowd gathered round
As he fell to the ground
A priest held his hand
Where he lay in the sand
And he was heard to say
A brave bull died today
But he died like a Toreador",El Toreador [Live],1999

Charlie Daniels,"A story bout a pal of mine who worked down near the Georgia Line
A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

BJ the DJ only twenty four a wreck at ninety miles an hour he'll spin the hits no more. ",B.J. the D.J.,2009
Charlie Daniels,"One day the train was passin' I caught it crawlin' by
To look this old world over under God's blue sky
My darling stood there weeping as I was looking back
I kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back
To where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
I get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I know I just can't settle down because I like to roam
And when I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps calling me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feeling don't try to hold me back
I'll only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
But she don't understand me when I'm feeling blue
And when I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
And leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but I've gotta go
Goodbye so long it's coming now just heard that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute you'll wave and I'll look back
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

Charlie Daniels,"Now, I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pop's picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day, he put him down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey's known to change a man, but

That's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be

Now, its been twelve years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.
He said sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs, they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said ""you want to sell a million records boy, you better listen to me""
He said ""change your style, whiten your smile, you can lose a couple of pounds
If you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?""

And I said, no, that's not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be

'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45
I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
And my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

Now, two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
""Don't Tread On Me"" is what is says and I'll take that to my grave

Because this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
'Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
'Cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be",Country Boy,2011
Charlie Daniels,"I love tearin' down some country road as the red sun's sinking down
Nothing but corn and cotton fields for miles and miles around
Down every twist and turn, there's another million dollar view
Some folks might not see it
But for some old redneck reason I do
I still wear my beat up boots and my old worn out jeans
I still say the blessing when I sit down to eat
And you can bet I mind my manners every time my momma walks in the room
Some folks don't think that matters
But for some old redneck reason I do

For some old redneck reason, sometimes I get the feelin'
Maybe I give too much of it now
I'm a little old fashion leanin', out of style and out of season
But I reckon that's just the way I am

Sometimes I lay here thinkin' ‘bout the good times that we had
Wonder why it all went wrong or the night it all went bad
And I probably shouldn't call you up, thinkin' I can patch things up with you
Oh, but when I get to drinking, for some old redneck reason I do

For some old redneck reason, sometimes I get the feelin'
Maybe I give too much of it now
I'm a little old fashion leanin', out of style and out of season
But I reckon that's just the way I am (Aw, how you feel about it Charlie?)

I was standing behind a couple teenage kids at a high school football game
They didn't take their hats off when the anthem was played
And I felt like jerkin a knot in their tail,
For disrespecting that old Red, White and Blue
Well now maybe I shouldn't get fightin' mad
But for some old redneck reason I do",For Some Ol' Redneck Reason,2013

So she goes through the drive-thru and keeps her sunglasses on
She didn’t know when she married that man
She’d get to know him like the back of his hand
But now she’s had enough, and the battle lines are drawn

He’s in a bar chasing Cuervo with Tecate
He doesn’t know she’s been taking karate

And started treatin’ her rough
Well, she took one look at him and her training kicked in
And she’d finally had enough

He threw a punch, she spun around
Grabbed his arm and put him on the ground
Grabbed a cuttin’ board on his way down and she kicked it in half
His knees hit the floor, his chin hit a chair
Knocked out his tooth and it flew through the air
Grabbed his head by the back of his hair and slammed him into the fridge
She landed a left, a right and then a left
She landed a roundhouse right in his chest and a scissor punch upside his head
Broke his nose, swept a leg, he started to fall
And on his way down, she took a bow, and the lights went out

He’s on the floor like he went a round with Rocky
He didn’t know she’d been taking karate

When they talk about the south they call it dirty baby
We was raised on cheese grits biscuits and gravy
We say sir and ma'am and we don't give a damn
If you like it or not we gonna hold our spot
Give me crown and coke or maybe jack and sprite
A case of Coors light and its on tonight
We talking about a party down on Johnson's farm
Late night country trouble we don't mean no harm
That's just how we do so tell me what you want
Some say they will but still most won't
Keep it banging till the sun come up hear the rooster crow then its time to go
Cause there's horses that need breakin' and cows that need pennin'
I do what it takes to keep them girls grinnin'
Every girl crazy about a bow legged boy
In tight jeans and boots that rope rides the chutes

You wanna come get your boots put your spurs on

Go on and spread the word we about to have a ho down
It's a party at Colt crib baby come by
You wanna saddle up I'll give you one try
And you a cowgirl so I know you know
How to hold on and ride like the rodeo
We ain't done yet your pretty silhouette
I'm hoping me and you can ride off in the sunset
I wanna get you all alone girl I can't wait to
Get you to my home I've got 35 acres
It's not quite 40 but I'm hung like a mule 
And if you got some friends then they can come too
We do it like they do it on the ponderosa
With a bunch of alcohol and my guns in holsters

Her lips are much too close to mine

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

'Round midnight, midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Charlie Haden,"Your my funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, 
You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photo-graphical, 
Yet youÂ´re my favorite work of art

Charlie Haden,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

To save us all from Satan's power 
When we were gone astray. 

O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy, 
O tidings of comfort and joy! 

From God our heavenly Father 
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds 
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born 
The Son of God by name. 

O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy, 
O tidings of comfort and joy!

Of a pure virgin bright, 
To free all those who trust in him 
From Satan's power and might.""

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace, their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.",It Came Upon the Midnight Clear,2012

The emblem of suffering and shame;

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!

And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Engage the waiting soul to bless.

Believe His Word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Always keep my eye on the time
When I'm 40
I'll still be 20

Give me time, get off me first

A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do, yes
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?","Cold, Cold Heart",1952

Charlie Hunter,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
what will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
and you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

Through the years we all will be together

So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,2005

I held you like I used to do
Then I awoke and finally realized
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you

I'm sure you've felt the same way too
And there are times I wish we'd never met
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you

Love is just something I don't understand
Tho I tried my hand a time or two
I don't remember how the feeling was

With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
Now, I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine a big 707's set to go
But, I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows
Now, the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes, my friend, well she's going down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly

There the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

Along the lonely thoroughfare,
It's not the time or place to look for you,

You said your lips were mine alone to kiss,
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

That you wrote before we made our sacred vow
And the way you said you felt tonight you wrote it

How can two people be in love so completely
And in a few short years drift so far apart
Some tiny thread from the vows holds us together
You're still mine but I'm no longer in your heart

Just between the two of us let's live up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone

Lonesome is a little boy lost in a crowd a telephone ringing in an empty house
Lonesome is an autumn leave that first falls from its tree lonesome is me

Or summer's last robin in winter's first snow
Lonesome is a little dog lost out in the street lonesome is me
Lonesome is an empty bottle a half filled glass of wine
The sound that clock makes when all you have is time
Lonesome is a heart that breaks when love has turned to hate
The dying sun at the close of day
Lonesome is a jail of tears that won't set me free lonesome is me
Lonesome is me lonesome is me

I still hear baby baby all night long",She Called Me Baby,1968
Charlie Louvin,"See the tree how big it's grown but friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
It would sure embarrass her when I came in from working late cause I would know
That she'd been sitting there and crying over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly caught her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
It was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robbins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day when I was not at home while she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey and I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed that honey loved
See the tree how big it's grown but friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it was just a twig",Honey,1968

No one else can make my arms feel like they're wrapped around the world
Yes I live my life just for you

Each day I wake up with a kiss just for you
And I count my many blessings and I thank the Lord for you
And each minute of the day I live a dream that has come true
Yes I live my life just for you
Just for you just for you",Just for You,1968
Charlie Louvin,"I catch myself still loving you
I walk down these streets every night about this time
'Cause you're in my heart and on my mind
I can't face the fact that we are through I catch myself still loving you

Memories are my company since you've been gone
Someone else now holds you like I used to do I catch myself still loving you

Charlie Louvin,"Today I found a dollar on the sidewalk so I went and bought a jug of wine
And I'll sit here in this alley and keep drinkin'
Until the thoughts of mama leaves my mind
Here's a toast to mama do you miss me do you even think about me anymore
Mama did you even stop to kiss me when you left me laying at a stranger's door

Oh how I wish I could've known you mama maybe now I wouldn't feel the shame
Maybe now I wouldn't feel so empty cause mama I don't even know your name

If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If you worked your hands in wood and if you'd ask me
I'd answer you baby yes I would I'd place you above me

Save my love through loneliness save my love through sorrow
I've given you my ownliness so give me your tomorrow
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your pretty clothes and your soft shoes shining
And if a thinker were your trade you'd still find me

That old sunshine stands silent at my door
But just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
As my tears go tumbling to the floor

Once again the whole town will be talking
Yes Lord I've seen the pity in their eyes
Cause they'll never understand it's her sorrow and not a man
Ah but no matter what they say I know she tried

Could you estimate how many eight or nine
Will you do it anymore as soon as you walk out the door
I just wondered did you ever all the time

Could I fix you one small no thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big that would be just fine
Is there any special way oh no whatever you say
I just wondered have you ever all the time

Does he look like no he's taller and more handsome
Is he as old oh no he's young and in his prime
Does your mother know I'll bet oh no I haven't told her yet
I just wondered do you ever all the time

Just for old times sake no that would be much harder

My castle of dreams plunged to the ground
How can you face me after what you've done
You've shattered my dreams one by one

One by one you broke each vow you made
It was you who lied it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun
We'll pay for our lies one by one

How can you go to sleep at night
Don't know memories make you long for daylight
You'll pay the price after having your fun
You'll regret each mistake one by one

Charlie Louvin,"Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times

I'll get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

And here in distance of a cotton gin a thirty minute walk to Ruby
Oh I'd walk it in the moonlight oh I'd walk it on the dark night

Only you can make it right

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night, night and day
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right so, make it right

'Cause every time I close my eyes I think of you
No matter what the season is
I still love you with all my heart
I wanna be with you forever, let's stay together

'Cause no matter what I do baby
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night and again night and day
I'd go for broke if I could be with you girl
Only you can make it right

Girl I, I only think of you each and every day
And I see I'm in love
If I could be with you girl
Only you can make it right

Girl I only think of you on two occasions
Do you think of me?

Only you can make it right

Charlie Mariano,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So 
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues

Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry

Charlie Mariano,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You,2002

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Pulled my foot from my mouth, answer back the things i've said. 
Wander through the valley of the shadow of the dead 
Stumbled on this old sun dial, then these words I read.
I only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day. 
I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away.

I'm alright ya'all. 
Alright y'all. 
Ya want to be alright you gotta walk tall.

I seen lots of brothers at top and I watched them come & go, 
Tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below. 

I give thanks everyday for these words they save my soul. 
I only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day. 
I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away.

When it's movin' too fast set it down 
When the goin' gets tough it gets you goin'

That the trouble's gonna come in all shapes and sizes

A word that sounded like a name
And it hurts me more than I can bear

But still
I still believe
The time will come 
When nothing keeps us apart

Arms and calms him)

I need you too!

Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1972

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself

Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

[Fab:] Yea, Uh.. uh.. uh.. uh

[Verse 1]
Yo, I preach through my raps
God is watchin me I still reach to my strap
Broads is watchin me they want to leech to my trap
Tha Jesus Christ on my neck reach to my lap
I teach you to rap in my Sunday School
These bitches get a one day rule
You gotta fuck be Monday, cool?
Or she gotta stroke a stick like the hun play pool
If not you gotta walk like a runway fool
Catch me in the moon shine or the sun ray jewels
If you keep sayin your prayers maybe one day you'll..
..be blessed like me 'til then keep stompin in your Air Force O-N-E-S Nikes
They should make scriptures wit my flows
I'm the young Bishop Don Juan that stripped ya for your hoes
So if I throw a dollar at ya scream Hallelujah
While I grab the neck of my robe and pop a collar to ya

[Reverend preaching]
Now in this world that we live in, there's all kinds of pimps
You got ya playas, ya ballas, ya macs, ya gorrilla
pimps that take what they want
Ya all-star pimps... Pimps that (?)
Pimps wit nothin but the Gators on ya feet (Preach to em brother)
Nice pimps, mean pimps

[Verse 2]
I feel like the angel of God
All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
Dis verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like its against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a thief
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'K
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me

[Reverend preaching]
Now just what kind of ho are you?
Are you a tough ho, or a soft ho? (That's right)
Are you a big ho, or a little ho? (Lil' teenie weenie)
A domestic ho, or an international ho?
A rich ho, or a broke ass ho?

[Verse 3]
Yea, me momma got my name from the Baptist who made
tha wrong moves wit the women and died for it
You make the wrong moves when you come and you try for it
New York City of God
I 'den saved some of New York's prettiest broads
I'm spittin the gospel
I hit my apostle's wit the coke that'll heal a sick
soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen

[Reverend talking]
Now some of ya'll are pimps, And some of ya'll are hoes
But the rest.. the rest of ya'll.. don't think I don't know
Ya just a hater.. They hate what you got
They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change (They hate change)
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
'cause they think its her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business (Amen)
And someody just put 25 dollars in the collection plate
So I'ma go up on the corner
And buy me a fish sandwich
why'all hold it down, I'll be right back

I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
",Sweet and Lovely,1991
Charlie Parker,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away?

Loved you night and day,

Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms

Just like a lot of people do
But since you taught me love's old story
I only dream of you

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,1994
Charlie Parker,"Why do I love you I love you not only for what you are
But for what I am when I'm with you
I love you not only for what you've made of yourself
But for what you're making of me
I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me
And for laying firm hold of the possibilities for good in me
Why do I love you I love you for closing your eyes to the dischords
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy
You have done it without a word without a touch without a sign
You have done it just by being yourself and after all perhaps that's what love means",Why Do I Love You?,1994
Charlie Parker,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

If it's me for whom those eyes glow?

Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1994
Charlie Parker,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be

Charlie Parker,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.

Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

That thrills and delights me, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1997

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream

That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1997

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

目と目があえば すぐに
(メリー ゴー ラン!
ゴー! メリー ゴー ラン!)
あなたのその くじさに

ゴー! メリー ゴー ラン!)
すこしずつでいいから
あわてなくていいから
静かに 深めて ゆこう

ふくらんでゆく この気持ちを

Charlie Parker,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Charlie Parker,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head,2003
Charlie Parker,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2003
Charlie Parker,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Charlie Parker,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Charlie Parker,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round Midnight,2005
Charlie Parker,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2005
