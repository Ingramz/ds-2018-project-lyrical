Bad news travels like a wildfire
And good news travels slow

Lumberjacked up in Maine

Johnny Winter,"I wonder if I care as much
As I did before

Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day
I wonder why I had to pay

The tears that I have shed by day
Bring relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if I'll suffer more

My pride is made to say forgive
And take the blame for what you did
It's your mistake I'm thinking of
I wonder if I'm still in love

As I did before

Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""

You're gonna break them in the end

Lost all 3 ways, I'm here to tell ya that sure ain't funny

But the sun was beginning to shine
Two riders were approachin?
But they were no friends of mine.

Called out for Hanna
And I kept here close to my side
Whistled for old Thunder
And my horse he was ready to ride

CHORUS:
I give you everything I had babe
Ain?t that kindness
I give you the good with the bad babe
Ain?t that kindness
Don?t cha know I give you my love when say babe
Ain?t that kindness
Hmmm ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun
Ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun

2nd Verse:
Took to the road 6 night and days
Only then did we think it was safe
Heard the sound of 2 men approachin?
But they did not hesitate 

Hanna she was cryin?
But she wouldn?t let go of my leg
Thunder he was tired
Been a thinkin? of a better day

Repeat Chorus:

3rd Verse:
Two shots fired and two figures fell
There was blood flowin? over the ground
Two men dead in the noon day sun
And they never ever made a sound

Hanna she never forgave me
And I think I know the reason why
When I called out for Thunder
The horse he up and died.

""Oh my, but that country boy can play!""

Johnny Winter And,"Oh, God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son"" 
Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on"" 
God said, ""No""--Abe say, ""What?"" 
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but 
The next time you see me comin', you better run"" 
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?"" 
God said, ""Out on Highway 61"" 

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose 
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes 
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?"" 
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know"" 
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run"" 
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun 
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61"" 

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King 
""I got 40 red-white-and-blue shoestrings 
And a thousand telephones that don't ring 
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"" 
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a moment, son"" 
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done 
Just take everything down to Highway 61"" 

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night 
Told the first father that things weren't right 
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white"" 
He said, ""Come here and step into the light"" 
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done"" 
But the second mother was with the seventh son 
And they were both out on Highway 61 

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored 
Trying to create a next world war 
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor 
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before 
But yes, I think it can be very easily done 
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun 
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited,2010

I lived my childhood again

And my tears, they fell like rain

Johnta Austin,"Shit, I'm a changed man, ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw

Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M O B

And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?

So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin'

I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin' past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat

Don't creep, oh what you think, T I P and them sweet?
Don't sleep, get you hit from your head to your feet
And you don't know me, I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload

You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neck piece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Your fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out “M O B”
Nigga we ride

I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number 1 in the nation, I fucked the world
The Judge gave me probation, faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to, the whole nation

Gimme nine, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz and fuck a bitch
'Cause a true sister love niggaz

Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke on Death Row
My adversaries bleed but fuck 'em all
'Til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

Everybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin' with a changed man, changed man

Well I was chillin' sittin', smokin' in my Escalade
Cadillac pimpin', lookin' for a escapade
I saw some bad body with a beautiful face
What it is hoe, you ain't from around the way
You got everybody lookin' and ya know that
Hair right, outfit, ass so phat
On top of that baby girl know just how to throw that
Too fine for me to fight and try to hold back
I had to immediately hit her with some West Coast game
Cause uh, all these niggas screamin' what's yo' name
And uh, buyin' roses and the best champagne
She can see through the glass that yo' ass is lame
She cool, she ain't trippin' off no cash flow
Cause she went to school and still puff-puff-pass though
Right in my alley, as we sat there shootin' the shit
I broke it down, broke it down to the shorty like this

Tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, and do it all weekend
Smoke blunts, get drunk, do it all weekend
From Thursday to Friday to Saturday to Sunday

I told the hoe ""You ain't had it 'til you had mine""
I'm a make you forget the nigga name of the last time
I'm a have you in my bed beggin' me for halftime
And after that we smoke-smoke and have some red wine
I can see it in her eye, she got the program
And plus she know she ain't dealin' with a poor man
I'm in the mood for some candles and some slow jams
A lot of niggas smooth but nigga I'm so down, and
(Girl I ain't playin' no games
I hope you're ready, for sure
I got the bubbly and a pound of that weed
And a pocket full of fetti, let's go

Damn
I just keep thinking about you (oh, baby)
I mean I wanna move on, but I can't move on (oh)
It's like you have some kind of hold on me, and I don't know (oh, oh, oh, oh)
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

I'm sitting, looking out the window like damn
Trying a fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on yo' mind, and I'm knowing that it couldn't be
'Cause you ain't call, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt wit' it all
I been running round with other chicks
I'm single, and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it, I'm tryin' a let you know I can't
Get a grip of it is what I'm tryin' a let you know
You got a hold or some kind of control of me
I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it, and it ain't getting no better
Just tryin' a be like, yeah, forget it, whatever
Instead of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together
'Cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do

You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you can call that (ah)
When I see you in the streets, that's the worst for me
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you on my pager
Know what you doing, where you at, or can I see you later? (Can I see you later?)
The fellas telling me 'just let her go, Bow.'
Believe me, I'm trying, man
I just don't know how
(Just don't know how)
I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin', and my brain ain't stopping thinking
Who she with, or where she going; is she club hoppin'?
I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right, cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do

Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been running through my mind all day
Can you feel me?
I been tryin' a get you off my mind, but I can't after all this time
That's what kills me

I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole lives planned out together (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
It's still hard, and I still love you till this day

Ain't drop one single of my own, girl

And I'm built to last

I done had my share with the right but um
Look there's something about you baby
Got me going crazy
And that's my lady, yeah, haha

Look, it's like this girl got me going all out
I got a few sick days, yeah I'ma call out
Scoop shorty, hit the mall, then we ball out
Catch a movie, grab a bite, then fall out
I got her spoiled rotten
She keep a dog droppin'
The latest wear she rockin'
Gotta get tour poppin' (fresh)
It was more shockin'
Them whores at the door knocking
And word for a second my g shock went
She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid
The only time we fight is on the Wii boxin'
I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend
Usually I keep a safe but the key locked in
But she a new type, maybe a new wife, 
Maybe the one I settle with in a new life
I gotta see, it's moving fast right now
I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow
Cause ahhh

[Chorus]
I had a few loves before, 
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down,
But you made proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before,
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

Like wha?

Like this

Like wha?

Like dadadada like this girl

I guess I'm kinda open
Just sitting here hoping that what we shared is more than a joke and
We can last like the great ones do,
As long as our love for each other stays true
Look
I see the growth, we done both came a long way
Arguments here and there,
Fuss and fightin'
Just showing that we care
Can't nobody else compare
Start it over with another, neither one of us were there
All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there
Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair
Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years
Try my hardest not to hurt her,
Hate to bring her to them tears
And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear
No, I let her drive a stick, 
She know how to work dem gears
Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career
Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears

She's my L-O-V-E

And every part of your body is so edible
I get tears from just thinking bout it

J’crois bien qui a qu’moi qu’aim’pas l’soleil
C’est pas d’ma faute
Y m’donn’sommeil
A quoi qu’ça sert l’soleil qui brille

REFRAIN

Puisque l’hiver il s’éparpille 
Madam’ la pluie vient l’remplacer
Mais j’ai trouvé dans tes grands yeux
Un coin d’espoir 
Un coin tout bleu
Mais ce coin là n’est pas pour moi
Puisque ton cœur n’est pas à toi
Et quand mon cœur est malheureux 
Il va tout seul dans ce coin bleu
Tu as caché dans tes grands yeux 
Un ciel d’amour
Un ciel tout bleu 

Mais un beau jour rempli d’étoiles
Mon ciel tout bleu sera sans voile
J’entendrai les fleurs du printemps
Crier l’amour à tous les vents
Adieu les cieux couverts de pluie
D’un coup s’éclaircira ma vie
Et que mon cœur sera en joie
Puisque le tien viendra vers moi

REFRAIN

Je t’emmen’rai dans mon coin bleu
Qui se cache dans tes grands yeux
Tu verras tout est merveilleux
Nous serons seuls et très heureux

We loved each other tenderly
Like we loved all lovers
Then when day you left me
Ever since I've been desperate
I see you everywhere in the sky
I see you everywhere on the earth
You are my joy and my sun
My nights, my days, my clear dawns

(CHORUS)

You are everywhere because you are in my heart
You are everywhere because you are my happiness
Everything that is around me
Even life does not represent you
Sometimes I dream that I am in your arms
And you speak softly in my ear
You tell me things that make me close my eyes
And I find that marvellous

Maybe one day you will return
I know that my heart waits for you
You can not forget
The past days we spent together
My eyes never stop searching for you
Listen well, my heart calls you
We can love each other again
And you'll see life would be beautiful

And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news

And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down

Joi,"Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Tell the sister like blood, little brother a thug
And how to survive the cracks in the middle of the mud
I'm the OG gangsta VL in the truth
Every nigga, in my city know how to tussle and shoot

My lil' homey got killed over a key and a pound
So when I pump, pump blood I'm a hold it down
His sister and his moms when I come around
Showin' love to the family when ya' lose your ground

Wassup lil' man had to write you a rap
Just to let you know this nigga, still got yo' back
Ain't too much change still doin' my shows
Stayin' away from fake niggas, and busta ass hoes

But enough about me and everything in my world
Congrats lil' dad heard you had a lil' girl
If there's anything they need and they ever in a jam
Don't hesitate to ask y'all call ya' Fam

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

But can you see life roomin' with no crack and pipe
And no weed to smoke no Gs in sight
And no cris to bust no wheels on bikes
And no pussy to fuck nobody to like

But can you see life roomin' with no money and goods
Big money heavy weights with nobody to cook
Nobody to book nobody to look
Tryin' to get back what motherfuckers they took

All you see is that platinum shit
A ghetto nigga, on stage grabbin' his dick
But you don't know what I have seen
From the bitches to the riches, to the triple beams

The project bricks the old school kicks
The early mornin' capers and the late night flicks
But since I moved on things ain't the same
I chose rap you chose the game

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

See your mom still strugglin' you up in the pen
But mom just wonderin when the end gon end
When the guns gon stop from spinnin' the bin
Or when the hood gon block the dope in the pen

Or when the light shot out you up in the park
The white trunk out your homey got marked
Or every nigga, that talk or rat in his heart
Or every nigga, that talk should die in the dark

I never forgot you and what we did
And how we came up and where we lived
I'm seven forever turn coke to never
Hard head 'til I'm dead until I'm 'bout my cheddar

Gotta get my ends wanna push a Benz
Eat steak live great and raise my twins
I can't believe I'm talkin' to ya' now that ya' gone
I luv ya' bruh and this is my song

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care

We're gonna have you charged with possession of cocaine with intention to distribute
Man, I ain't sold that, man! That, man, why is you doin' that, man?

The rhymes I design are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine
Flows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes
Giving birth to the lines, soul search for the prize
I takes my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT, while these other niggas bite
Underrated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight

Just think now you don’t gotta usher in change

Just free your mind from all the negativity

Make a new life, never boo hoo
Never lose sight, I'm true dude

Better stop drop when the squad's hot, we don't stop a lot
We don't talk a lot about it, we just pop it off a lot

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Joja Wendt,"(James Brown sample) ""This is a Man's World!""

Verse 1:
Lies and rumors, money and hoes
it's the World that I'm attached to, the World that I know
influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?
for the paper Nature takes it too far, perfectionist
rep the bridge, where everything's foul except the kids
we get it on, and contradict livin' long
though the clock will still tic when you gone.

Chorus
(This is a Man's World!)
Now if you a Man be a Man (you need a plan)
if you fall (I'ma put you on your feet again)
when you starve (I'ma show you how to eat again)
and through it all (I'll show you how to be a friend)
now when you in charge be in charge (you need a squad)
if you bored (I'ma show you how to be involved)
I give 'em more (niggas know they can't see the God)
I can't believe it God (I gotta eat or starve)

Verse 2:
Keep the livest image, high percentage
Four in the mornin', 
niggas blitzin' on corners like the line of scrimmage
convicts turnin' confident
enter the phase of niggas and they feminine ways
love my Timberlands, cinnamon suede
bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot
wild niggas on the block look for more to recruit
gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed
It's been Twenty-somethin' years now,
I'm still lookin' for the same dream.

Chorus

Verse 3:
In my World police recognize names
know us niggas by the walk or the size of their chain
you know the motto
we live for today, there's no tomorrow
we're only makin' time for the hoes that swallow
fuck a role model, I need therapy
seven nights out the week I jump out my sleep breathin' heavily
keep my head up, only the strong survive
livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of feindish when I'm at this
Been doin this for eons, peons best to catch this
vision of excellence, precise rappin ability
Bout to make some dead presidents, macking a million G
The money though, it's got people actin funny yo
As soon as some niggaz get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin played out
When authentic niggaz step up, respect be layed out 
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, waving my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, creme de la creme
Spent years buildin with cats in the streets, so they my men
Again, GangStarr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days?  You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listening to beats to keep the cypher complete
Wether you kids be holdin, on the block all day
Or you be puffing lye, out in the back hallway
Or whether you being schooled, or in the library
Wherever you are Baby Pah, realize that your essence
is divine son, and let it shine son
As we refine son, aiyyo, this shit'll blow your mind son
We're royalty
   
Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest  
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey annoits me with oils G
After work she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there, be lookin lovely
But they don't got no control of the their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
   
Whatever I do, Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest  
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best

JoJo,"You know the story
You read the books
Boy meets girl
Then they fall forever in love
But I know better
So here goes a tale
Of the realest of the real
Listen

Now once upon a time in a small world
It was everything that I dreamed of
He was my gem and I was his pearl
Nothing could come between us
A prince charming to call my own
Until the day that he broke my heart
And left me wondering all alone
Picking my mind and soul apart

Used to believe in love (I used to believe in love)
Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)
Since my heart's been crushed (It's been crushed)
Just don't believe in a tiny hell (No no no no no)
Don't know which way to turn
Figure it out for myself
I've just started to learn (La da da dee, oh)
There's no such thing as fairy tales

Is a good story supposed to end
Unhappily ever after
Just as wonderful as it begins
And carry on for a few chapters
Baby how come each time I open up
I can't seem to get past stage one
I guess it's time for me to close up
And go back on the shelf because I'm done

Used to believe in love (I used to believe in love)
Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)
Since my heart's been crushed (Since my heart's been crushed)

I've just started to learn (La da da dee oh)
There's no such thing as fairy tales

Twinkle twinkle little star
Why do my dreams seem so far (Why they seem so far)
Up above the world so high
Won't somebody tell me why (Can you help me)
Can you help me out
Can you tell me what love is all about
Cause I never known it for myself (Don't believe in fairy tales)
That's why I don't believe in fairy tales no more

Used to believe in love (No more)
Used to believe in fairy tales (I used to believe, I used to believe, I used to
Believe)
Since my heart's been crushed
Just don't believe in a tiny hell (I don't believe in much)

I've just started to learn (Just started to learn)
There's no such thing as fairy tales (There's no such thing as fairy tales)

And we were like crew
Straight to junior high school
Then you messed it all up
Started pushing up
Kissed me on the cheek
And I fell in love

Into big things, he's a baller now

I can see he's still down
I can't forget him (No no no no)

It just ain't the same
Catching feelings now
I should tell him (Yea)

Don't want to be my homeboy no more
Saw something that I never saw before
I think he wants to be my baby, baby
Oh I've known him all my life (My life)
Now I see him in a whole new light
Something about it feels so right (That's why)
I think he wants to be my baby, baby

Every night when we get home
Under covers talking on the phone
Here comes my mother
It's way too late
Might get in trouble
My heart can't wait (So much to take)
Writing till my hand cramps up
4 pages saying I'm in love (more than a crush)

Can't get you off my mind (Come pick me up baby)

And your rims are spinning on the side and

So won't you come sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together always
Hope you know that when this late at night
I hold on to a pillow tight
I think about how you promised me forever
I never thought that anyone could make me feel this way
Now that you're here boy all I want is just a chance to say

Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone

You said that you would treat me right
But you were just a waste of time (waste of time)

Tell me why you looking so confused
When I'm the one that didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
You go behind my back and call my friend
Boy you must've fall and bumped your head
'Cause you left your number on her phone
So now that after all that you've said and done
Maybe I'm the one to blame but
To think that you could be the one
Well it didn't work out that way

Get out (leave) right now

But I have no choice you've got to leave
Because my heart is breaking with

On something that just would not last
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these eyes (oh, oh)

Help us find love 'cause love is overdue
And it looks like we haven't got a clue
Need some help from You

Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope when it seems our hope is gone
'Cause it seems like so much is going wrong
On this road we're on

No, no, no, no, we can't do it on our own
So, so

Give us the strength to make it through
Help us find love 'cause love is overdue
And it looks like we haven't got a clue
Need some help from You

Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope when it seems all hope is gone
'Cause it seems like so much is going wrong
On this road we're on

This time
This time
This

I made the mistake like before
Givin' you the third degree
Takin' you through it
I told you I get what I want
And I ain't tryin' to hear nothin' else
But just do it
Then I had to take a good look
When everything else didn't have a ring to it
I'm sittin' here blamin' myself
When I saw what you were feelin' inside and misused it

This time it's all my fault
This time I can't let go
This time I did it really, but I got these feelings
How am I supposed to know?
Can't let my weakness show
Have my fits may 'cause me to miss this first chance at real love

This time I won't let you get away from me
This time I'm gonna let you take it where it should be
This time I won't say no
'Cause so you know it's a way to protect me
Baby, this time (this time)
This time (this time)
This time (this time)
I'm a let you want me

Every female I know
Can't seem to take her eyes off of you, and I see it
It's just that my girls been so hurt
And I'm not tryin' to be the next one goin' through it
I see that I got something real
And I don't wanna lose it
I gotta say thank you
The thought of you gone gives me chills
So, baby, let's just put this aside and come here

This time it's all my fault
This time I can't let go
This time I did it really, but I got these feelings
How am I supposed to know?
Can't let my weakness show
Have my fits may 'cause me to miss this first chance at real love

This time I won't let you get away from me

This time (this time)
This time (this time)
I'm a let you want me

Never will I deny you love me
All this time you stuck here and didn't leave my side (my side)
Now I know what 'trust me and you will see' was
And I owe you all my heart and deepest apologies
So let's take this back to where we gotta, man
I just wanna do this with you, boy (boy)

White wine, Swishers, blunts
And your hating girlfriend, chilling in the cut
They told me you the realest so I had to check
And I don't lift weights but I had to flex
Then we had sex
And we stayed up for three straight nights
Talking 'bout shit that's abstract

I love it when you tell me stories
I love it when you kiss my head
I love it when we in the club
I love it more when we're in my bed
I coulda wrote a love letter
But I wrote you a song instead
And I think our timing is fine
I'm reminded girl, you're the realest
So we got it so timeless

Real with your words so I trust you
After the show, girl, I really wanna fuck you

I busta free, these niggas must be crazy (what) 
There ain't no mercy mutha fuckas 
Who can fade the thugs? 
You thought it was but it wasn't 
Now disappear 
Bow down in the presence of a boss playa 

It's like 'cause, blood, gang banging 
Everybody in the party doing dope slangin' 
You got to have papers in this world 
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl 
Ya doing ya job 
Every day 
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray 
Let me tell you about life and 'bout the way it is 
See we live by the gun so we die by the blood of kids 

They tell me not to roll with my glock 
So now I got to throw away 
Floating in the black benz 
Trying to do a show a day 
They wonder how I live with 5 shots 
Niggas is hard to kill on my block 
Scheme for currency and dough related 
Affilliated with the hustlas 
So we made it

JoJo Garza,"Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking, when we're tossing it up

Listen baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on!

I like the way you please me, yeah
The sexy way you tease me, yeah (that's right)
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy!
Your body hypnotizing (hypnotizing)
Your smell is so exciting (so exciting)
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me!

I like the way you give it to me 
Let me see you toss it up!

I like the way you give it to me 
Let me see you toss it up!

I like the way you give it to me 
Let me see you toss it up!

So I like the way you give it to me 
Let me see you toss it up!

Play on, play on, play on, play on (oh baby)
Play on, play on, play on, play on (lemmi see you play on)
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on (K-Ci)

Oh, it's K-Ci baby (yes)
Hmm, that want you lady (yes)
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy (that's right)
The way you move that thang
You make me wanna sang
Girl you make my bells rang
Make them go ting-a-ling!

Now the man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feeling too good!
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty titillating delight-ah
Bag it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me!

I like the way you give it to me 
Let me see you toss it up!

I like the way you give it to me 
Let me see you toss it up!

I like the way you give it to me

Let me see you toss it up!
So won't play on oh yeah!

How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day, arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play
Check your sexuality as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Looking for suckers cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming ""Compton"", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs!
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up!

Let me see you toss it up! (Toss it up)
Won't you toss it up 
Let me see you toss it up!
Let me see you toss it up! Toss it baby baby

Ohhh yeah

One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of feindish when I'm at this
Been doin this for eons, peons best to catch this
vision of excellence, precise rappin ability
Bout to make some dead presidents, macking a million G
The money though, it's got people actin funny yo
As soon as some niggaz get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin played out
When authentic niggaz step up, respect be layed out 
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, waving my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, creme de la creme
Spent years buildin with cats in the streets, so they my men
Again, GangStarr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days?  You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listening to beats to keep the cypher complete
Wether you kids be holdin, on the block all day
Or you be puffing lye, out in the back hallway
Or whether you being schooled, or in the library
Wherever you are Baby Pah, realize that your essence
is divine son, and let it shine son
As we refine son, aiyyo, this shit'll blow your mind son
We're royalty
   
Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest  
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey annoits me with oils G
After work she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there, be lookin lovely
But they don't got no control of the their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
   
Whatever I do, Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest

She give me blows under the belt like a dirty boxer

And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'
They gave me eight bars, no room to breathe
And eight darts nigga, no one to leave

Stop, drop, roll out the booth
Th rims come out the tires
I stop, hop fall off the roof
Only thing you should know is that's them hoin'

Of the shining black stars that circle my heart

Came over me stealing

Is laid at the feet of all our purposes

Safe and cold, no more desires
Will light their fires or disturb my immaculate calm

And the birds of the air and the beasts of the soil
And the fishes of the desperate seas
Will know who I am and our substance will expand
As part of everything

As part of everything, my God
As part of everything and the clouds will roll
And the wind will blow and the beautiful birds will sing

My lonesome lover has taken off
I'm wondering around on a cloud
Empty heart, I've been down and out

It's been a week I think since he wrote and it's sad
And it's been years that I've heard these stories about this
Fella he's so brave and so alive
Turning this world around from the out to the inside

Well our courtship was brief and magnetic
I was singing at the corner bar
And we both felt so romantic
We took a walk with the moon
Down to the train yard

Well it was too much for me
My gypsy heart was inflammed
Put me at the head of your list
And don't forget to call my name
Well I fell in love with a boy
Who has a real life romance with a train

Oh my beautiful lover and friend
This is exactly what I wanted
And now I'm feeling so haunted
And I can't get you outta my mind

And I can tell, you are not real

I don't know why, I am here myself
No one else seems to know

Nobody likes a spook or so I've deduced
But I have loved some ghosts in my time
But that doesn't mean I want them around
I'd rather be lost than found, I thought I would loose my mind

But through your eyes I see
Past the billboards to the trees
And the flowering weeds
Grow through the cracks of the city

And all these things will go
And all these seeds will grow
And you'll be home in the sky

When the moon sails high, a ghost ship in a dark and lonely sea
Mockingbird, your song burns right through me
I know why you singing, all the day and every night

Jolie Holland,"You're like a saint's song to me
I'll try to sing it pure and easily
You're like a Mexican blue
So bright and clear and pale in the afternoon

I saw you riding on your bike
In a corduroy jacket in the night
Past the hydrangeas that were blooming in the alley
With a galloping dog by your side

When I was hungry you fed me
I don't mean to suggest that I'm like Jesus Christ
Your light overwhelmed me
When I lay beside you sleepless in the night

And when you dreamed my guardian spirits appeared
And the moon stretched out across your little bed
They said they'd started to get worried about me
They were happy we had finally met, we had finally met

A mysterious bird flies away
Seemed to be calling your name
And bounced off the top of a towering pine
And vanished in the drizzling rain

There's a mockingbird behind my house
Who is a magician of the highest degree
And I swear I heard him rip the world apart
And sew it back again with his fiery melody, melody

When you were mad at me I didn't care
And I just loved you all the same
And I waited for the wind to push the hurricane
Out to sea, and the sun could shine again

Oh, I don't mean to give you advice
It's just like Delia said, ""Oh, Jesus Christ""
Just don't get so high you leave the ground
Everything is so much better when you're around

Just don't float so high you drift away
Stand tall, with your feet on the ground
I love your songs, I love your sound
Everything is so much better when you're around

When the moon is as clear as an opal
And the amethyst river sings a song
I'll remember all your dreams and the mysteries
You have borne in your crystalline soul

That you sing from your golden throat
That you shine from your sparkling eyes
That you feel from the goddess in your thighs, oh

About someone I barely knew at all
He was a friend of my friends and they told me about him
How he had nothing to break his fall

He had that bad religion in his blood
The kind that brings you down and can never lift you up

He was a beautiful young man on the streets of Austin
He was a ghost faced junkie on the streets of New Orleans
I could barely recognize him when I saw him
He had to look me in the face and say my name before I knew it was him

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

What if they only gave you love when you lied?
It's bound to really rip you up inside
Pressures a person into that horrible mouth that leaves a bloody aftermath
Everything minus one is everything

He treated me with what I considered kindness
When I crawled off to sleep in my car he was worried about me
When we payed our respects to the moon on the outskirts of Austin
I'm sorry to say I was too shy to stay in touch with him

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

And I wonder what it takes just to save one little life
Icarus almost made it back to the shore
When I was really down, there were three little words
From a couple of good people that kept me holding on

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

Jolly Music,"I was looking for a woman to be good to me
I was with the other people and they had to eat
I couldn't go alone, I didn't know my way
Don't know the language, so I had to stay
Woke up in the morning with a job to do
Twenty seconds later got stuck in the queue
When in Rome they're digging to extend the lines,
They're running into ruins, gotta stop all the time
Went upon a hill to get a view of the town,
Didn't really happen 'cause the clouds were down
Brought a CD player to be checking our song,
Didn't do recordables we moved along
To an elevated garden overlooking the street
She was standing with a spinett at the side of her feet.
Shouted to her promising to make her a star
She didn't have the time and she left in a car

Prego amore vieni con me.

Waiting for a DJ, but he never turned up
Figured that he didn't 'cause he knew he would suck
I was sitting in the rhythm backing the beat
Couldn't see her dancing back on the street
Just because you got the magic happening then
Doesn't make it certain it'll happen again
Just because you know someone is looking for you
Doesn't have a say in who they're running into",Prego Amore,2003
Jolly Rogues,"Near Banbridge Town,
In the County Down
One morning last July,
Down a bóithrín green
Came a sweet colleen,
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so neat
From her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
Such a coaxing elf,
Sure, I shook myself
To make sure I was standing there.

Chorus:
From Bantry Bay
Up to Derry Quay,
And from Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I've seen
Like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.








As she onward sped,
Sure I turned my head
And I gazed with a feeling rare.
And I says, says I,
To a passer-by:
""Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?""
He smiled at me
And he says, says he,
""That's the gem of old Ireland's crown.
Sweet Rosey McCann
From the banks of the Bann,
She's the Star of the County Down"".
Chorus:
   She'd a soft brown eye
And a look so sly,
And a smile like the rose in June,
And you hung on each note
From her lily-white throat,
As she lilted an Irish tune.
At the pattern dance
You were held in a trance,
As she tripped through a reel or a jig;
And when her eyes she'd roll,
She'd coax, on my soul,
A spud from a hungry pig.
Chorus:

I've traveled a bit,
But I never was hit
Since my roving career began;
But fair and square
I surrendered there
To the charms of young Rose McCann.
I'd a heart to let
And no tenant yet
Though I'd searched countryside and town;
But in she went,
And I asked no rent
From the Star of the county Down.
Chorus:

At the harvest fair
She'll be surely there
So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes.
With my shoes shone bright
And my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut-brown Rose.
No horse I'll yoke,
No pipe I'll smoke
Though my plough with the rust turn brown,
Till a smiling bride
By my own fire side
Sits the Star of the County Down.
Chorus:  ",Star of the County Down,2003

Spill it out on the floor of belief

The story about a boy in the rain
He was standing waiting for for the light
As though he did have a reason to know
Did he really know?
His eyes were open they expected someone
In his heart he felt the compass was turned on

Every thought, though it takes so long,
Is master with every plan

It would seem there is no end
To the bad or goodness in man
So my friend it seems the weariest night
Just leads to a heavenly dawn
Should we see so much
In every time we sigh

Even this we could call music
As that would match my body connection
Let me take your hand, I will be beside you beside

Displaying an almost indefinable strength
Of purpose, a reason, a reason, a reason
Where no reasons seems to exist

Yet, as in a vision, a voice transcending
All our imagination, jewel of life
Guiding light heralding a joyous new dawn
Clear and gifted time
Divine nature, super nature
The supreme gift of knowledge and space
In this cacophony of life

[Chorus:]
Peace will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Peace will come

Come true horizon
Come true horizon
Come true horizon

Peace will come [Repeat x 3]
Will come

Reach for the starlight
Reach when it calls you
You, you are the reason
If you want
You are the answer in the end
La la la's...

Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
So again, a change, it comes
Our world desires a way
Touch a child who's lost, afraid,
It lifts you to true emotion
True feelings, be the light
All that is good in this life
Is good, good is good

Oh everlasting dream, oh future come alive
To witness comes that time
I just can't help but believe in life,
All in all I just can't help but believe there is a way
For us to give, a way for us to live
A way for us, a way for us",Horizon,1983

Jon & Vangelis,"If you just take my sense of freedom
If you just take away my home
You can't ever hope to win me
This I'll tell you for sure
There is strength in the common people
For the people is all we really are
Young and old, the wisest and the lowly
Each indeed is 'Holy' in the 'Light of Love'
When the 'Word' comes
I will be waiting
Like a dove that shines he prays for peace
Some have waited what seems a lifetime
Some are waiting now to be released
For the moment we have this freedom
We will choose the way our hearts will move
All the people lost will find their way
Give that chance today
Hear and I will pray
No not for nothing hearts will not be broken
As long as we are open
Our hearts will make us free
Free for the Earth man
Free for the millions
In the 'Glory' all will come to 'Truth'
No aggression, that we leave behind us
To be replaced
By 'You'
For tomorrow another morning
For tomorrow another day
In our children there's that sense of freedom
Help them use it wisely
I will pray",Polonaise,1983
Jon & Vangelis,"Out in the woods we play our songs
And travel through the woodlands together
In the light of heaven
And the silence of the world.
Keeping in touch with the sun
Keeping it for everyone
Latter day dreams that come your way
Will gather in the light
Everything about today just mellows
In the ligght: in your eyes.
I think about silent list
Drowned this summer, travel light
All the deeds and the candlelight
But there is no explaining it
Let the weary come around-one more time-
One more time
Let the weary come one more time around.
I should have guessed that things
Were getting out of hand, the other day
When you told me that you'd gone and left
Your father's ways behind
and you thought that you, couldn't understand him
Well, he didn't really answer the dreams
That you'd planned
So you chased around, all those times,
That come between you, yourself and yourself,
One more time, one more time, one more time
Did you have to think about it, one more time
Put yourself under pressure one more time,
One more time.
Things are looking better now
I heard you say the other day that you knew
So many times I've tried to understand,
We go through
Then again it's the morning light
That can catch my heart aflame
Just the thought of your sweet face
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over and over and over and over again.",One More Time,1984

Will open your heart, your life.
Anyone can light a candle,
But not the way that you do.
For if we look too close,
Pure magic we would be.
Pure magic we would see.
It's all around each one.
It's all around within.
The perfect union,
Close inside your dreams.
To watch in wonderment,
As each day begins.

Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river

You let your long brown hair hang down
Your summer dress was swaying in the breeze
When we were skimming stones across the stream
You had a lazy style and a carefree smile
You were a breathless beauty to behold

In my bed the other night
Thinking about my teacher

Just like coming out of the womb

There's only so much room
People kick and tear your brain

Spill it out on the floor of belief
Come and mend this design

I have seen the sun, this sounds crazy
The story about a boy in the rain
He was standing waiting for for the light
As though he did have a reason to know
Did he really know?
His eyes were open they expected someone
In his heart he felt the compass was turned on

Every thought, though it takes so long,
Is master with every plan

To the bad or goodness in man
So my friend it seems the weariest night
Just leads to a heavenly dawn

As that would match my body connection
Let me take your hand, I will be beside you beside

And how you're sending your love
Through the air today

I think of heaven
Each time I see you walking there
And as you're walking
I think of children everywhere

It's in your star sign
You're growing stronger
I can't believe you
It's so good to care

Through enchantment, into sunlight
Angels touched your eyes
Your highness, electric, so surprised

Is this your first life?
It seems as though you have lived before
You help me hold on
You have a heart like an open door
You sing so sweetly
My love adores you
She does, she's thinking of you right now 
I know

The summer's coming
I'll keep in touch so you're not alone
Then like a Swallow, you'll fly away
Like birds have flown
So let me tell you
How much I love you
I'd make the songbirds sing
For you again

Well now it's good night
Sweet angel, read this letter well",Deborah,1983
Jon Anderson,"Out of the mist into tropical splendor
With garlands of flowers
In Majestical fusion we see tonight
Onto this sacred reunion of pleasure

They touch the light

King is sailing we hear
King is sailing they say
King is sailing this day of days, of days
Cocasaya Tay Toca

Drums beating faster through harder excitement
The wings bring the angels
They singing of truth that this day has come
Older than oldest religions have promised
A promise is kept on this golden reflection
His kingdom come

King is coming they sing
King is coming they know
King is coming we sing
King is coming we know, Kotao, Kotao, Kotao

All the millions of souls he to touch, he to touch

Heaven set sail in his ship full of light
He transcends all our love
To caress all our fears
In a moment divine
Weakest and strongest will dance in delight
All illuminous our saviour, they bringing him forth

All will sing to the night
Our true Kingdom come [Repeat x 3]

Higher, then higher, then higher, then higher, then higher
Ahhs...",He Is Sailing,1983
Jon Anderson,"In amongst the rings of confusion
Silencing the thought powers one by one
It seems all so incredible
Our own ability to confuse, to sacrifice
To enlighten like a Shakespearian play
We foolish and happily hold on to sanity
While all around the pushing
And prodding of our feelings
The twisting and turning of our hearts
Displaying an almost indefinable strength
Of purpose, a reason, a reason, a reason
Where no reasons seems to exist

Yet, as in a vision, a voice transcending
All our imagination, jewel of life
Guiding light heralding a joyous new dawn
Clear and gifted time
Divine nature, super nature
The supreme gift of knowledge and space
In this cacophony of life

[Chorus:]
Peace will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Will come true horizon
Come true horizon
Come true horizon
Come true horizon

[Chorus]

Peace will come [Repeat x 3]
Will come

Reach for the starlight
Reach when it calls you
You, you are the reason
If you want
You are the answer in the end
La la la's...

Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
So again, a change, it comes
Our world desires a way
Touch a child who's lost, afraid,
It lifts you to true emotion
True feelings, be the light
All that is good in this life
Is good, good is good

Oh everlasting dream, oh future come alive
To witness comes that time
I just can't help but believe in life,
All in all I just can't help but believe there is a way
For us to give, a way for us to live
A way for us, a way for us",Horizon,1983

If you just take away my home
You can't ever hope to win me
This I'll tell you for sure
There is strength in the common people
For the people is all we really are
Young and old, the wisest and the lowly
Each indeed is 'Holy' in the 'Light of Love'
When the 'Word' comes
I will be waiting
Like a dove that shines he prays for peace
Some have waited what seems a lifetime
Some are waiting now to be released
For the moment we have this freedom
We will choose the way our hearts will move
All the people lost will find their way
Give that chance today
Hear and I will pray
No not for nothing hearts will not be broken
As long as we are open
Our hearts will make us free
Free for the Earth man
Free for the millions
In the 'Glory' all will come to 'Truth'
No aggression, that we leave behind us
To be replaced
By 'You'
For tomorrow another morning
For tomorrow another day
In our children there's that sense of freedom
Help them use it wisely
I will pray",Polonaise,1983
Jon Anderson,"Cage of freedom
That's our prison
Where the jailer and captive combined
Cage of freedom
Cast in power
All the trappings of our own design
Blind ambition
Steals our reason
We're soon behind those invisible bars
On the inside
Looking outside
To make it safer we double the guard
Cage of freedom
There's no escaping
We fabricated a world of our own...

Cage of freedom, growing smaller
'Til every wall now touches the skin
Cage of freedom, filled with treason
Changing sides as the losses begin
Our suspicion tries escaping
But they step up the security
There's no exit--there's no entrance
Remember how we swallowed the key?
Cage of freedom, that's our prison
We fabricated this world on our own...

Big brother
Is there a bigger one watching you
Or is there one smaller
Who I should be watching too

Snakes eating their own tails

Can you tell, is he on your side?

Yet another spy...",Cage of Freedom,1984

Legends can be now and forever
Loved by the sun, loved by the sun

Whether there is hope that is torn apart
In the words of all that's singing

Anyone can light a candle
Just like a flower in the rain
You are unique, the same
Each step you take, each dream you realize
Will open your heart, your life

Anyone can light a candle
But not the way that you do
For if we look too close
Pure magic we would see
Pure magic we will be
 
 It's all around each one, it's all around within
The perfect union close inside your dreams
To watch in wonderment as each day begins
They tell me you can hear this song

Anyone can light a candle
But not the way that you do
For if we look too close
Pure magic we would see
Pure magic we will be",Candle Song,1994
Jon Anderson,"Demande-mot de tout changer
Car dans mon coeur, l'air que je respire
Attise la flamme de mon desir
Rien que ton nom me met en feu

I need to know if I'm secure
As all my plans call from the dark
And need for light and I
So young to know my life

We sepak of love
I never felt as Ido with you
Such as the mood
My feet don't even touch the ground
Then all at once
As one and one with love
I only care
You're never far from me
To be my friend
All my dreams begin with you
To be my guide
Each breathing moment
I need the spark
Each singing flame
I need the soul
Each whispered sigh
We've walked the earth
Each song we sing
We've climbed the stars
To fly to the sun

Sweet angel, did I have to see for myself?
Your eyes are my eyes that spin me round and round
All love is the colour of the spiritual ground
We've walked, yes we've walked by his side
As all is one, so this we are
Holding the flower, being the star

You left so young
Tu es douceur
I am alone
L'amour see'est toi
But here you'll stay
Ma vie see'est toi
Not near, not far
Mon ame see'est toi
You've been my life
Mon coeur see'est toi
Tonight I'm yours
For evermore
A tout jamais!",Chagall Duet,1994

Jon Anderson,"Hearing, talking, yes I love you
Set your heart, sail along the river
Look around as you drift downstream
Pouring souls into the ocean
Take account of all you've seen

One people together, freedom for today
So easy the future, so see the children's way
Love me, teach me, know me

One people together, freedom for today
Tomorrow forever, so see the people's way

Many moons cascade one river
They light from side to side
As we cross in close proximity
Like rivers our hearts entwine
Howe we talk, how we teach our children
How we move, we direct our eyes
Like senses tuned discovery
As and as when our hearts decide
Be ready now, be ye circle
Be the central force ye life
As the game extends the cycle
Be ready to move

[Chorus:]
One heart's for love, one's for giving
Sailing down the river
Two hearts are better than one
Throwing out a line
I'm hearing it, I'm living it
I believe in it, I'm loving it
Sharing in our fortunes
Two hearts are better than one
In and out of time

As we flow down life's rivers
I see the stars glow one by one
All angels of the magic constellation
Be singing us now",Hearts,1994
Jon Anderson,"How you gonna live through the dreams that you think about
How you gonna leave them behind?
And how you gonna search for the things that will help you
Through the end of time?

All you need to think of is hope and the good in love
And all that surrounds seems to hustle and bustle you
When you need to stay by my side
In this time of life

How you gonna know if it's love in a modern way
How you gonna reach the high you need?
How we gonna dream about the many things we think about
How we gonna let it be?

Oh! but I know you are mine
And it's almost divine
How we find ourselves
We ask ourselves
Do stars shine?
So it's love more or less
A special thing, to be true

How you gonna feel it when you cannot live it
How you gonna kiss the one you need?
How you gonna reach for the dreams that you think about
How you gonna let it be?

Oh! but I know this is right
We kiss in a special way
I think about it every night
Think about you every day

Jon Anderson,"Look in to the windward
Chance would be there
Circle the skies
Circles in the corn
Circles in the spiral of our eyes

Where will we be
Where in heaven is love?

Look into the first light
Caught in the moon
Singing with the changes
Dancing then making us sigh

Who the first to see them
Patterns of the memory?
Asking us to wonder
Asking us to listen
Where are we now?

The earth is new
The world is clear
The earth is ready
Making us hear
The world is new
The Earth is clear
The earth is ready
Making us hear

Can you believe the music
Can you believe the passion
Can you believe the healing
Bringing us the messages?

Positive the reason
We see the circles
Part of our memory
Part understanding

Messages of other worlds
Coming through in mysteries

It is the world

Light the fire

I may not always stoop to win
Cause we can change how we begin
I won't deny my brothers sight
Without them how will I fly?

Same chance
Same time
Come along

When you're the best judge of yourself?
You hold a power so unique
You have the power to change your world

But your brother does
I said, I don't mind and they don't care

And who are they to change, when they don't even know it

And all because they came around and touched you like you thought you had
Blew it out into the sky and someone else could even die
As always in their eyes they would be true
And fly right up to you and say that they would always trust in you
Now every night it comes

An older sign of life upon their heads
So when they came around and talked about the way they treat their children
When they talked about their death 
And said that they would sometimes hold out
When they crawled out between the boards alive 
And tried to stretch for air to survive
How were they supposed to be alive at all
So every night it comes

And who are they to know, as they are to achieve it
And who are they to change, when they don't even know it
An older sign of life upon their heads
How many souls have cried for years
Thank God the angels make them see
And take their souls to liberty
Arise above the way that humans treat their children so, so low
Pushing all the love away

Of how we met as you recall so clear

Jon Anderson,"I heard you on the radio
Some other time
From some forgotten studio
Way down the line
So long, so long I've waited now
To hear you again
That song, that song will still remain
It's become an old friend
And now, the tears are in my eyes
The sound you can't disguise
The truth comes back from lies
And all I want to hear

Voice of America, ooh, America
Voice of America, ooh, America

And then you came in stereo
Calling to me
And so I watch the videos
Across the T.V.
That sound, still ringing in my ears
From a decade ago
Around, around my head, the sound from my radio
I thought, that after all these years
The tears, the growing fears
That I would never hear
Never again

Jon Anderson,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007
Jon Anderson,"A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream,
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Turn round tailor, Coins and
Assaulting all the mornings of the Crosses
Interest shown, Never know
Presenting one another to the cord, Their fruitless worth;

All left dying, rediscovered Cords are broken,
Of the door that turned round, Locked inside
To close the cover, the mother earth.
All the interest shown, They won't

To turn one another, to the sign Hide, hold, they won't
At the time Tell you, watching the world,
Watching all of the world,
Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

We have something gentle,
Girl you know
Measure up the distance,
Can we find (out baby)
Just how far this thing could go

I got a love I can't be denied
Hey girl, just give my love a try
And I won't let you down

Jon B.,"Well after the party's over
Black limosines they gather round
Our stance, our secret romance (We are having)
Nobody knows your with me
Cause you're a stranger to that world within me
So you said so softly on the stranger's bed

No I could never imagine your lips being that red
The smell of wine is on your breath
I trip out when I think of the things we did
I wish I never, I wish I never did

Chorus:
Oh special baby (Oh special baby)
I'm so sorry lady, come into my life
(So sorry laby)
(Come into my life)
Forever seemed to be one night
Oh special baby (Oh special baby)
I'm so sorry lady, came into my life
(Came into my love and you were gone before light)

Well after the morining's over
Feeling so bad and sober
I don't care cause you're not there
(You1re not there)
Feeling the fire within me
The pulse of last night's heart beat
Still echoes within me
I can feel your skin

No I could never imagine a love affair like this
So secretive when we're both kissing
When I'm with you baby
'Cause you're a special lady
(Chorus)

You called my name and I knew that was you in the corner
With the cognac eyes and a body that seduced me
And I said...)

Jon B.,"I know a place
Where we can get it on good, baby
As far away, baby
From the world and all the city lights

From the normal things
From the normal dreams
And you're not thinking 
About your man at home
Just me and you alone
Ain't it scary, baby

I'd make you mine, oh mine

Jon B.,"Love's golden band
Little hands that have gripped a thousand years
You thought he was the only man
As he left you in your December tears
He don't deserve
A woman like you
A man like me
Needs to show you
What real love is supposed to be
Funny how the days of new
Keep speeding up
But the night of old
Seem like they're slowing down
But don't you cry
To save the truth
From coming out
With words that let him go
I guarantee he won't be back around

Chorus:
Love don't do
What he did to you
Don't you know love was made for two
Me and you
Love don't do
What he did to you
Love don't leave you in the cold
Maybe the tale you've not been told
Story of all he did to you
Love don't do

Come in from the rain
Outside take off your coat
Come over here by the fireplace
I know baby, I know it feels so bad
When someone you love
Comes and leaves your side
Strange what desire
Can make people do
Following foolish pride
They say you don1t really love somebody
'Til you love them enough to let them go
Seems these cliches had a reason to be made
His love came a lifetime too late
You had to let him know
(Chorus)",Love Don't Do,1995
Jon B.,"Strange bizzare way to start a relationship
You got the hips to swing all tips

You are down and baby
I'm so addicted to your drama
I've taken good advice straight from your mama
I got a woman satisfied, oh

Jon B.,"So I guess tonight kinda had that flow
I head you say ""go for what you knnow""
So I took upon the thought of meating you at 12:00
For a private little rendezvous
At first I didn't catch your name
Curiosity causing me pain
And the only thing to do
Is to get to know you better
With you timid little easy sway

If love stains my mind
With the ebony you
And these words seem like lines
Let the truth cut through
'Cause I fantisize reality with you
Open my eyes for the mystery of me and you

Chorus:
Ooh me and you
Mystery 4 two
Ooh me and you
Mystery 4 two

I guess the night kinda had that flow
Mr. Moon in the sky hung low
And I saw your face
Pretty dressed in lace
And I didn't know what to say
Honey baby you just stood there
Just kicking with that stare
And I stood fighting with my instincts
But the fight is not fair

If love stains my mind with the vision of you
Please rewind it, make this moment be true
'Cause I can1t stop thinking about you, oh
The myterious you
(Chorus)

We can make love under the stars
Baby it doesn't mater where we are
Honey me and you, we can make it through
This mystery
(Repeat & Chorus)",Mystery 4 Two,1995
Jon B.,"There's many tears and sad love songs
For all those who lost to love (yes)
Nobody seems to know why we do what we do
To each other when the times get rough (yes)
I thought that love was plain and simple
But oh what a lie
I've been counting on the one that I love
It's not that love breaks your heart
You know love don't love nobody
I guess the level that loved was too much

Chorus:
Ooh, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow
Noo, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow

You see there's not many ways around the mountain
For all those who choose to climb
Sometimes it feels like no matter how far I get
The distance is all up to time
See I gave my love my only faith
But oh what a shame
I felt wealthy with my bag of fools' gold
And there's a point when you know
That love's off the tracks
When the train stops 'cause the engine's too cold
(Chorus)

Don't want to say I lost my faith in love
No, I don't want to say I've given up on my dreams
I believe in everlasting love, yes I do
Just give it to me, what I want
‘Cause it1s only you
(Chorus)",Overflow,1995

Hold up, let me take my pants off, baby
Hold up, let me make love to you, baby
Hold up, let me take my pants off, baby
Hold up, let you be real with me, baby

Messing around again
Acting like way back when
We were just beside ourselves
With love, touching your lovely skin
Remembering feeling within
To rush the moment could be so hasty
When you taste me
(Chorus)

Exploring the most within
If we're in love then is it sin
Pushing my thoughts into your dreams
You know what I mean
Pouring our body melts
And in the morning tell me how it felt
Hope it's just as good for you
As you are to me
(Chorus)

Me want to love you and know you, baby
Me want to get it up for you
Me want to take my pants off, baby

The way you walk, I can't resist your style
When I sleep at night, I dream of you, ooh baby
I wake up wet, thinking of you, ooh baby
How can a man like me
Convince a girl like you
To be his lover and one and only
How can I make you see
That I'm the one for you
And nobody does it like me
 
[Chorus:]
Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?

Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you calm through the night
Your legs around my waist so tight
I'll slide down south to taste you right
You taste so good to me
How does a man like me
Seduce a girl like you
How can I make you my one and only 
How can I make you scream
There's no one else for you
'And nobody does it like me, baby

There's a candle that's burning in my heart tonight
And the flame is full of my desire
And I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight
And I'll touch you in the places
Where no one's been before
And I'll kiss you in the places
Where men sometimes ignore
And I'll take you to a level
You've never felt before
And though you won't understand it
You'll cry and ask for more

Jon B.,"I learned so much about love
Since I've been by your side
And you spend all your time
Knowing what you've done for me
The simple fact is
That I'm longing for you, girl
Desperate and needing you to stay in my life

'Cause I'm sorry but forgiving
But your love for me id for the wrong reasons
I wish I could satisfy you baby
But you're so sick of the those natural things
Guess I'm a fool for loving you
But honestly the truth is

Chorus
Time after time
I'll be yearning for you
Dime after dime
I thought I was earnin' 4 two
Maybe this time you1ll be the one
Who feels the pain
Time after time again

I used to be such a baby
Crying in your arms
But now I'm older, wiser
Now I'm hip to the scene
Tell me, when you make love to that someone else
Do you think of how it felt
Different with me when you feel asleep?
When you wake up, I was there

I was honest
I was changed for the good
But the bad of it all
Is it's worth nothing, nothing to you
I wonder if after it all
Is there someone still waiting for me
Is this all in the plan for the helping hand
I wish it would be you
But I know it can1t
(Chorus)

You gave your reasons why
You made perfect sense
But you'll miss your water
When your well runs dry
'Cause somewhere, I believe
I was the one
You'll have your fun
In the back of your mind
You'll find that you still love me
Time after time

Jon B.,"Girl I knew the first tme
That I saw your pretty eyes
It was gonna take a damn good line
To make a girl like you surprised
I knew you were a woman with cladd
But way doem to earth
I could tell by the way
You let them down easy
When the other guys try to flirt and I'd do

I would do anything for your love
I would go anywhere for you touch
And I would go anywhere anywhere with you

Just let me know the deal
Could you fall in love
Just let me know for real
Could you feel the same
Just let me what you feel
Could you fall in love
Just let me know
Would you let me know
The deal with you baby
I said never never stop oh no
On on on and on
To the break of dawn baby
 
Let's just take it easy in the corner of the VIP
It was just you and me
Not just dancing just glancing
Into each other's eyes
Now you see that I would do anything

Jon B.,"Sometimes love can feel
Like the closest thing to heaven
Sometimes love can feel
Like you've been run over by a car
Yes it can it's the strangest thing I know
Make you feel warm when you feel cold
And if you dowm on happiness
You better get used to the taste of sadness
Cause love can sure hurt sometimes
 
Chorus:
Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
 Love hurts and it don't
 
Some people will tell you
It's the best thing for the heart
Yes they will what they fail to tell you
It can tear your life apart
But you know it's as sweet as a summer rain
But it can hit you like a train
Fill your heart with pain
Fill your heart with pain
Ooh everybody sing, everybody sing

Bridge:
When you know that you're alive
Cause you feel so much pain
When you feel you can't survive
But you make it anyway
When it feels too good to stop
But it hurts too much to say
Then you know, yes you know
You gotta know love hurts
It hurts and it don't

Baby all I want is you
Mami you got me now right next to you
Mami all I want is you

Ey, you know you wifey to me 
Thats why I love you 
Cause you know your the baddest baby 
That Ive ever seen
Just ask it will be yours 
And I know that you really like it too

I know what you like babe 
I know how to make you ooh 
Babe don't have to cry ever again
You keep me satisfied babe 
No pigeons on my mind babe
I'm straight real wit the way that I feel

Yo mami all I want is you 
Don;t know what to do when I'm love with you
Got me going crazy baby boo thats the honest truth
Promise the menogame only if you ride with me
The sky's the limit if you with it
You can come and fly with me
As long as you don't lie to me and show me true love
Represent and stay beside of me 
Just like my crew does
Keep the shit we do in privacy between the 2 of us
You can right it in your diary 
Don't keep it a grudge 
Now is that asking for too much 
Cause you packing that good stuff
This attractions more than lust 
You feel my pressure when we crush and plus
You got the sweetest touch 
Got a Man I'll beat him up
I need your love got a high head
I don't believe in luck
See me up in a stretch limo next to my people
Jon B mami please listen to my demo hello
I keep it ghetto like this hour on my peddle
If you like flowers then 
Follow my trail of rose petals

Dancing feels so good tonight
When your dancing looking so fine
Ooh baby shake that stuff like you do
Move that healthy body and I'm a come dance wit u
Baby baby come on",All I Want Is You,2001

Sweetheart
What's up with your boy?
Come on

Your so-called man's got you stressin' out on a regular
Seems all you do is just fight about nothin' baby
Out with his friends he comes home late night
(He's got more important things to do)
You see the signs makin' love
He don't take his time
All in a daze someone else must be on his mind
Plans for engagement change to another day
(There slipping far away)

All that you need is a little bit of tenderness
Stability in your life
Pull a star out of the sky and place it on your hand
(Star out the sky and I place it on your hand)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants your love babe)

He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around
Cause the boy is not man
(He is not a man)

I can't sit by and watch a man just mistreat a dime
He's got a jewel in his pocket that he can't find
Feel like your loyalty is wasted girl
Why do you chase it girl
(You might as well face it girl)
Is it worth it girl I know it's gettin' old to you
He's givin' dough to you
But he's so cold to you

I'm a stop second guessing myself
And step up straight to you
Want to relate to you and I got the taste for you

All that you need is a little bit of tenderness
Stability in your life
Pull a star out of the sky and I place it on your hand
(On your hand)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants
(He don't know if he really wants but I know I do girl)

He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around
Cause the boy is not man

He don't understand your problems
So how's ever gonna solve them
Baby you know I want your love

When he's sexin' you does your spin get chills girl
New positions everytime, I will girl
You need a change of plans
The boy is not a man
(The boy is not a man)

He don't understand cause
Boy is not a man
Still messin' around
Don't know what he really wants

He don't run your baths
And no he never had your back
Stop messin' around

Your problems
Does he ever try to solve them

Jon B.,"I looked in the mirror today
Took a good look at my face
And all I guess that I can say
Is I'm just a man trying to find his way

It's been a long and windy road
But at least I got you to hold
And I've become the man I am
'Cause all our troubles made me understand
It's been all of our lives

All of our lives I want to stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
But I'll do it all again to be with you

Ever since we went through with the plan
I'm feeling like I've become a better man
'Cause I'm giving up that part of me
That held me back from being free

And now when we kiss I feel your soul
I'm putting back the pieces others stole
And now nobody can hurt
My baby cause we make it work

I can't hold the rain back when it starts to storms
(Just let it rain)
You don't have to fight your feelings anymore
(We can learn from the pain)
When I'm all alone I count the reasons why
Just till you think girl, you'll be alright
You just take your time
All of your live

All of our lives I want to stay this way

Being as beautiful as you
Trying to save your love for the one that's true
It's not always so easy to know what's right to do

It's your first mistake, you can't make
Make someone be down with you
Why do you even take the time out to call that fool
When you know deep in your heart that he don't care 'bout you

Pretty short cuts or, hair to the middle of ya back
Looking just like that
I like short shorts and the tight jeans
And the summer dresses and the small feet, all petite
See that's what little bomb mamas is made of
But most of why'all suckas like cluckas that's made up
Treat her, however ya run into or meat her
I hope she got a head on her shoulders like miss Cita

[Chorus:]

Oooh girl, shock 'em now
Looking down, can stare you down, all around
The eyes won't stop looking at my baby (Yeah they looking at my little thang)
I'm flattered but baby
Better let 'em know (Tell 'em who's it is)
Oooh girl 'cause you are mine
You are mine you are mine you are mine
I'm so glad I've seen a girl like you
Who be down
I hope I can return, return to you
The pleasure you give me baby boo
Oooh when we do do do the things we do

[Chorus:]

What you looking so cute for?
I'm fresh off the up in smoke, Dr. Dre and Snoop tour
Bomb in your short skirt, girl make that skirt work
What you want a G like, need a G in your life
Every wonder what a GCG is like
Ever wonder what being with a DP is like
One night, I like 'em just like you
Me and Jon be	, in Venace by the beach
Try to see what we can see
I got a (?) a new Bonaville
I got a house on the hill, where me and you could chill
See the party starts at eight, but you don't come 'till 10
'Cause ain't nothing cracking, and that's when it begins
I like Carona's by the car load, Henn' by the cases
Save the Coca-Cola I don't get down with the chasers
It's a secret location, I don't want no skirts popping up trying to chase us
Mad 'cause why'all switched places

Jon B.,"Girl it's alright, baby
'Cause it's there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me

Left once again at home
Another night on your own
Ain't no fun in lovin' if you're lovin' alone
How does it feel to be useless, oh no
Can you recall how close we used to be then
Can you still remember those feelings again
Seems like every time I see you
There's a tear in your eye
Time to make some decisions
Or go dying inside

Tell 'em all call me a fool
But I'm stuck in this love thing
Plus I'm over heatin' from the rush
Our tongues touch
Kissin' fellin' fireworks
Watch the sky
I makes you smile
But you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and leave now
With my heart on my sleeve
Memories now what I found is you
Still care you had feelings
And they're still there baby
Girl keep it real here
Are you still down?

Remember that evening
I knew that you were too scared
To go all the way
But you did it to please me
You were crying it was raining
When u gave it to me
The more I see you
The more that I feel inside
And I know one day
You'll make it back to where you can fly
Watch time go, don't cry
Tomorrow brings better days
Let me dry your eyes
And take your burden away

Only once in a lifetime
Touch my soul go slow
Baby boo don't rush the flow
Got me all weak baby
But I'm strong in parts
More bounce to the ounce
With the longest sparks
Gettin' mine like fine wine
Measured in time
Many other brothers loved you
But the pleasure was mine
Mama taught me how
To love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it
So it's properly done
Are u still down?

Part 2
This is for all the homeboys who couldn't get their happy home
As long as one of us got it some of us got it
Stay down for me, hold on

Verse 1:
Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrevelant
Cause I'm still thinking about the love that's gone
Morning, cooking breakfast back at home

Chorus:
I never meant for this to end
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember my happy home, home, home

2Pac:
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role just to keep up your faith in God
Knowing you'll get scared though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watching older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it'll help our child grow then together we die
Why question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I wonder what you must feel like now you know
That I'm having a seed with someone else
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody baby Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby I can't say enough that I'm sorry
Oh, I never meant

[Chorus]

Ya body shape is great, Collaboratin is fate
When you open up the gates, be ready to love make

Cause your looking so nice

A bowl of strawberries, and some moet rose
Some ya sweet talkin' in ya ear, make ya come out them clothes
When the moon light reflect off the sweat of skin,

Lemme swim inside ya ocean, ya body is smooth as lotion

My plane is boarding soon and it's so plain to see
That one could lose his way
So could you pray with me
That I don't lose my soul in the luxury?

Money the jealous type, I always knew it
I knew she'd come around if I only sweat the music
But I'm starting to believe it, that's a problem to my health
'Cause the size of half these checks could make me vomit on myself
But I give it up to heaven 'cause it isn't Jon
The chorus and instrumental, oh you think it's odd?
I don't have to give you lyrics 'cause I know it's God
That's why I get emotional when the chorus drops

Oh
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

We're not sad at all
We know you have to leave and we're not mad at all
You'll be back in town and we'll play basketball
And if you fall off track we'll be your Adderall
We won't let your soul drown in luxury

See, my joy lies in the son and you should jump on that
She'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one
But she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one
I’m not judging, here in the middle like I’m Malcolm, son
Verbal trigger like you should never play around with guns
Bow down to no crown, these goobers out for the count
'Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding face in the lounge
Sober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd
With a thousand counting me out, but I'm here and killing the crowd now, blow

Bring me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's only smiling 'cause my soul is flying
I did everything for New York

Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you

Let me give the kids just a little help
Tell 'em money is not the key to wealth
'Cause if it can stop the pain
How the fuck did you explain the bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?
So you can take me off your winner's shelf
I got different vision, I'm bringing help
I know the demons in the room gon' say it's more that I can chew
But now all I hear is the dinner bell
I need a family that loves me right
Don't need a chain, don't need a club at night
I had a conversation with an angel
She told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life
Dropped off in the land where the artists play
Where God's way is the hardest way
Told myself I'm keeping my faith
If it costs me my reputation, then take it, I'll give it all away","New York Soul, Pt. 2",2016
Jon Bellion,"Yeah, I think I got one
Her soul is presidential like Barack, son
Yeah, she call me Goose, I call her Maverick 'cause of Top Gun
They say we annoying, they just jealous cause we got love
Yeah, I got a hot one
She don't want a problem if there's not one
But people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
She give you the people's fuckin' elbow like The Rock, son

There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

""Hey, do I impress you?""
I really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
When you working out and I'm just watching how your legs move
They would think that you was, like, developed in a test tube
You deserve a theme song
You could be the shoulder that I lean on
Love it when you're late for work and try to slip your jeans on
You be bumping Chili Peppers all up in your Nissan

There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
'Cause everything about you is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming

Jon Bellion,"We're six feet underground inside my bed
And all the little letters in my head
We're spelling suicide but not by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my back breaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

The only friend I had wore black and red
The darker instruments inside my head
We're playing suicide but not by choice, by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my hands shaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

Don't hold the weight of the world
I don't hold the weight, I don't hold the weight

This the flow that helped me tip the scale
I'm stackin' chips like Chippendale's without the strippin'
Get the bailiff out 'cause Mr. Bellion's out the cell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin' equipped with the gift of spit
Like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to Spiderman

I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger
No one will shock the world, got a buzz like a mini Blanka
When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda
Got what it takes to be great, but can't hold this weight any longer",Weight of the World,2016
Jon Bellion,"Take your clothes and rip 'em, rip 'em off
Call these hoes and tip 'em, tip 'em off
You can tell them you are mine
I'm sick of, sick of games
No more time, you lit the, lit the flame, yeah

We live in an age where everything is staged
Where all we do is fake our feelings
I've been scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah

I realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh

I am forced to give in, give in now cause

Nothing I can say
That folks don't criticize me
But I'm gonna do
Just what I want to anyway
Don't care if they all despise me

If I go to church on Sunday
And I honky tonk all day Monday
Ain't nobody's business if I do

And if I should get a feeling
I wanna dance upon the ceiling
Ain't nobody's business, oh it ain't nobody's business if I do

If I stay out all night
Spend all my money, well that's all right
It ain't nobody's business if I do

You try to tell me I got no right to sing the blues
What gives you the right to tell me what I should do?
It ain't nobody's, ain't nobody's business if I do
