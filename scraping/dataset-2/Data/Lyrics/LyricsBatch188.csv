Eddie Cano,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady take a lesson from me

Together we'll see many brighter days
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways

Eddie Cano,"It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel lover well.

You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright",A Hard Day's Night,2003
Eddie Cano,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway 
On Broadway

Eddie Cantor,"I was strolling out one evening by the silvery moon
I could hear somebody singing a familiar tune
So I stopped a while to listen
Not a word I wanted to miss
It was just somebody serenading something like this

[Chorus]
Mandy
There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee
So don't you linger
Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?
Come along and let the wedding chimes
Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

[Chorus]

Oh, what a wonderful day
Cupid, the parson, he'll say

I'm feeling kind of nervous to hear the wedding service
Now we'll hear the wedding bells, soon we'll hear the baby yells

Wait just a minute, my dear
I have the ring, never fear

What a fine ovation from all of our relations
Sister and brother, father and mother
And Mandy and me",Mandy,1988
Eddie Cantor,"Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Eddie Cantor,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Eddie Cantor,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man,1993
Eddie Cantor,"Father has a business, strictly second-hand
Everything from toothpicks to a baby grand
Stuff in our apartment came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing someone wore before
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second-hand hats
Second-hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second-hand Rose
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second-hand pearls
I'm wearing second-hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new
Even Jake, the plumber, he's a man I adore
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just
Second-hand Rose
From second Avenue
From Second Avenue
New?",Second Hand Rose,1993
Eddie Cantor,"Once I was happy but now I'm forlorn
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn 
Betrayed by a maid in her teens
Oh, this maid that I loved she was handsome
And I tried all I knew, her to please 
But I never could please her one quarter so well 
As the man on the flying trapeze!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
He'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks 
While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night to his tent he invited her in 
Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease
You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
Her actions are graceful, all girls she does please 
And that's what's become of my love
",The Man on the Flying Trapeze,1994
Eddie Cantor,"My little Margie, I'm always thinkin' of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you
Don't forget your old promises to me
I have bought, I gotta a house and ring and everything

Days are never blue

Eddie Cantor,"Every time I hear that dear old wedding march
I feel rather glad I have a broken arch.
I have heard a lot of people talk
And I know that marriage is a long long walk.

To most people weddings mean romance
But I prefer a picnic or a dance.

Another groom, 
Another sunny honeymoon,
Another season,
Another reason
For making whoopee.

Another victim is by her side.
He's lost his reason cause it's the season 
For making whoopee.

Down through the countless ages
You'll find it everywhere.
Somebody makes good wages.
Somebody wants her share.

She calls him 'Toodles' and rolls her eyes.
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies.
What is it all for?
It's so he'll fall for making whoopee.

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear?
Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected so he's suspected
Of making whoopee.

She sits alone most every night.
He doesn't phone or even write.
He says he's busy.
But she says, ""Is he?""
He's making whoopee.

He doesn't make much money: 
Five thousand dollars per.
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""

You better keep her.
You'll find it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.",Makin' Whoopee,1994

The birds are singing for me and my gal.
Ev'rybody's been knowing to a wedding they're going.
And for weeks they've been sewing every Suzie and Sal.
They're congregating for me and my gal.
The parson's waiting for me and my gal.
And sometime I'm gonna build a little home for two for three or four or more
In love land, for me and my gal.",For Me and My Gal,1995

In the words of Shakespeare she's a ""wow""
Though all of you may know her, too

Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Alladin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day; 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter

Eddie Cantor,"I was strolling out one evening by the silvery moon
I could hear somebody singing a familiar tune
So I stopped a while to listen
Not a word I wanted to miss
It was just somebody serenading something like this

[Chorus]
Mandy
There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee
So don't you linger
Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?
Come along and let the wedding chimes
Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

[Chorus]

Oh, what a wonderful day
Cupid, the parson, he'll say

I'm feeling kind of nervous to hear the wedding service

Eddie Cantu,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be
My hillbilly hula gal, my hillbilly hula gal

",Hillbilly Hula Gal,1997
Eddie Carswell,"Not a word was heard at the tomb that day
Just shuffling of soldiers' feet as they guarded the grave
One day, two days, three days had passed
Could it be that Jesus breathed His last

Could it be that His Father had forsaken Him
Turned His back on His Son, despising our sin
All Hell seemed to whisper, ""Just forget it, He's dead""
Then the Father looked down to His Son and said

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise, My Love

The earth trembled, and the tomb began to shake
And like lightning from Heaven, the stone was rolled away
And as dead men, the guards, they all stood there in fright
As the power of love displayed its might

Then suddenly a melody filled the air
Riding wings of wind, it was everywhere
The words all creation had been longing to hear
The sweet sound of victory, so loud and clear

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise

Sin, where are your shackles
Death, where is your sting
Hell has been defeated
The grave could not hold the King

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

John called Ann and Jim got Sue
I made a date with little ol' you
Off we went to make a big tent on the weekend

Boy, it's great, just a-stayin' out late on a weekend
Know a spot and like it a lot on a weekend
Took a road to Lookout Hill
The view up there is sure a thrill
What a night to hold you tight on a weekend

There we were just sittin' cool and cozy
Just about to steal a little kiss

Sayin', ""holdin' neck o'er there, what is all this?""

Took a chance on crashin' a dance on a weekend

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

Eddie Condon & His Orchestra,"I used to think I could live without you,
But I admit that I changed my mind.
I go to sleep and I dream about you,
And through the day you can always find me,

Blue because we're parted,
Blue and broken hearted
There was a time I was jolly,
You know the reason I'm melancholy!

Blue and oh, so lonely,
True, I want you only.
We made a blunder,
And lots of times I wonder, dear,
If you're blue too.

Eddie Condon & His Orchestra,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Eddie Condon & His Orchestra,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

Eddie Condon & His Orchestra,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Et des boniments que j'ai entendus
Sur le mois de mai et ses espérances
J'étais l'oiselet piégé dans la glu
J'étais un' enfant c'est incontestable
Mais un' enfant moch' comm' je ne sais quoi
Par définition un' enfant coupable
Quêtant l'aventur' l' soir au coin d'un bois

Au coin de ce bois pleurant la chevêche
Elle en avait l'air mais cett' garce-là
Au lieu de gémir se riait d' ma dèche
Et de mes pieds nus bleuis par le froid
Un' nuit j'aperçus aux branches d'un chêne
Deux ou trois pendus en guis' de pavois
Des freux ressemblaient à des fruits d'ébène
Alors j'esquissais le sign' de la Croix

C'était le chef-d'oeuvre d'un grand capitaine
Qui peuplait l' pays de ses souvenirs
J'étais bien trop jeune pour sentir ma peine;
Ça n' m'empêchait pas de me rendormir.
Les marpaults venus d'un pauvre village
Galopaient la nuit de peur des narquois.
Mais moi j'attendais sans doute un beau page
Vêtu d'écarlat', coiffé comm' un roi.

La nature est bonn' pour tout ce qui bouge;
Plus tard un vaurien m'a pris' par la main.
Ceux du coin du bois l'app'laient d'Auneau l' Rouge;
Il m'a dit : "" Saut' gueus', le lit est dans l' foin ""
Ce fut la kermess' tendre et libertine
Jusqu'au jour maudit où j' le vis tout droit
Dans l'aube livid' quand la guillotine
Tendait ses deux bras devant le beffroi

Alors comme il faut un' fin à tout's choses,
Aussi décrépit' qu'un hibou tondu,
Je suis revenue reprendre ma pose
A l'orée du bois du bon temps perdu.
C'est l'heure de la fin pour les vieill's drôlesses
Je ne vaux pas plus qu'un fagot d' bois mort
C'est peut-êtr' l'imag' d'un' vie sans sagesse

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

To keep love and romance forever alive

Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie 'em in a knot?
Can you tie 'em in a bow?
Can you throw 'em o'er your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?
Do your ears hang low?

Do your ears stand high?
Do they reach up to the sky?
Do they droop when they are wet?
Do they stiffen when they're dry?
Can you wave them at your neighbor
With an element of flavor?
Do your ears stand high?

Do your ears flip-flop?
Can you use them as a mop?
Are they stringy at the bottom?
Are they curly at the top?
Can you use them for a swatter?
Can you use them for a blotter?
Do your ears flip-flop?

Do your ears stick out?
Can you waggle them about?
Can you flap them up and down
As you fly around the town?
Can you shut them up for sure
When you hear an awful bore?
Do your ears stick out?

Do your ears give snacks?
Are they all filled up with wax?
Do you eat it in the morning
Do you eat it in the bath?
Do you eat it with a scone
Or do you eat it on its own?
Do your ears give snacks?",Do Your Ears Hang Low,2001

Porque viven en la isla pero de la fantasía

Pa' nosotros esto es pan comió, 
Va muy ligero ni sueñes con ser primero 
Donde manda capitán no manda marinero

De Puerto Rico pal mundo es victoria 
Haciendo cosas diferentes,

Tengo mucho mas trucos que el cinturon de batman

El que deba algo mas vale que salde 
Cree que eso tirando lírica que arde

Y vine pa cantar cantar con mozilla
Quemando como el tequila, causando extragos como gozilla 
Te estas metiendo con el tipo equivocao
Tengo algo pa ti por ley, porque no se a presentao

Tu anda bien guillao, con un estilo copion
Con carro alquilao y un prendao pretao 
Mucho DJ te an grabao? cuanto te as ganao
Pa pelao, quemao porque te an utilizao

Vivo underground, reciclando lo que e sonao
Entre lo mejore me e paseao, no me an opacao

Es eredao del borin que me dio otro lao 
En extinciona porque hacemos las cosas decora
Mientras otros buscan fama,billete y corona

Prueba que no estoy de acuerdo con la tiraera

Y soy del ghetto, vengo para obtener respeto
No hago como otro que quieren actuar como moyeto

Te guta como el balla sunba? quiero que sepa que soy queso 
Y moreno porque nací de la rumba

This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

This isn't just mid summer madness

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost

Do you know how a lost heart fears
The thought of reminiscing
And how lips have taste of tears
Loose the taste for kissing

Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

The spell of a theme starts you to dream there's always a chance
As long as there's music, whatever the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song

Eddie Fisher,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",The Best Thing for You,1958
Eddie Fisher,"We'll be close as pages in a book
My love and I
So close, we can share a single look
Share every sigh

So close that before I hear your laugh
My laugh breaks through
And when a tear starts to appear
My eyes grow misty too

Our dreams won't come tumbling to the ground
We'll hold them fast
Darling as the strongest book is bound
We're bound to last

Your life is my life
And while life beats away in my heart
We'll be close as pages in a book

Eddie Fisher,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

Should cause you such misery and pain

Eddie Fisher,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

And I am a fool for beauty

When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Leaves are moving faster along the ground
Why have all my dreams been broken wide apart
Where is all the hope that was in my heart

Another autumn, I've known the chill before 
But every autumn I feel it more and more
For you can dream in spring when every hope is high 
But when the fall comes in they all begin to fade and die

Another autumn so sleep when all is well
But how it haunts you when all is wrong
For one thing time has shown if you're alone

Eddie Fisher,"She's a babe
Just a babe
Still cavorting in her crib
Eating breakfast with a bib

With her baby teeth 
And all her baby curls
She's a tot
Just a tot

Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she
Doesn't even know that boys aren't girls
She's a snip

Just a snip
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys
Just a chickadee who needs a mother hen

She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose
She's too infantile to take her from her pen
Of course, that weekend in Trouville

In spite of all her youthful zeal
She was exceedingly polite
And on the whole a sheer delight
And if it wasn't joy galore

At least not once was she a bore,
That I recall
No, not at all
Ah! She's a child

A silly child
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven how it shows
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers she has got

She's a child
A clumsy child
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape

Where her figure ought to be,
It is not!
Just a child
A growing child

That's so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears
I am certain he will never call again!
She's a scamp and a brat

Doesn't know where she is at
Unequipped and undesirable to men
Of course, I must confess
That in that brand new little dress

She looked surprisingly mature
And had a definite allure
It was a shock in fact to me
The most amazing shock to see

The way it clung
On one, so young!
She's a girl,
A little girl!

Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower!

Oh no
Oh no
But, but,
There's sweeter music when she speaks

Isn't there?
Could I be wrong?
Could it be so?
Oh where, oh where

Did Gigi go?
Gigi! Am I a fool without a mind
Or have I merely been too blind to realise?
Oh Gigi! Why you've been growing up before my very eyes

Gigi! You're not at all
That funny, awkward little girl, I knew
Oh no! Over night there's been a breathless change in you

Oh Gigi! While you were trembling on the brink
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?
Oh Gigi! Have I been standing up too close 
Or back too far?

When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?
Gigi! 
Gigi!

Gigi!
Oh no! I was mad not to have seen the change in you
Oh Gigi!",Gigi,1960

She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon

I was serenely independent and content before we met

Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

With the sound of music
With songs they have sung

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to prey

I go to the hills

Eddie Fisher,"When you're alone and life is making you lonely,
You can always go  
Downtown.
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know. 
Down town.
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city,
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty.
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there,
You can forget all your troubles,
Forget all your cares.
So go down town
Things'll be great when you're
Downtown.
No finer place for sure 
Down town,
Ev'rything's waiting for you. 
Downtown.

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you,
There are movie shows  
Downtown,
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close.  
Downtown.
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle Bossa Nova,
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over.
Happy again.

The lights are much brighter there,
You can forget all your troubles,
Forget all your cares.
So go down town
Where all the lights are bright 
Downtown 
Waiting for you, tonight 
Downtown,
You're gonna be all right now.  
Downtown.

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you.
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand
To guide them along,

So, maybe I'll see you there,
We can forget all our troubles, 
Forget all our cares.
So go downtown
Things'll be great when you're 
Downtown, 
Don't wait a minute more 
Downtown,
Ev'rything's waiting for you.

Eddie Fisher,"Once upon a time a girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time very long ago

Once upon a hill we sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Once upon a time the world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours, how happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time never comes again

Once upon a time never comes again",Once upon a Time,1965
Eddie Fisher,"People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world

With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

People, people who need people

Eddie Fisher,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Bright as the stars we're under

This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Eddie Fisher,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May

That lived within the heart of me

Became impatient to be free

The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills,
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wond'rous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But, thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too

That grown men never cry, baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die

He was just someone, someone I knew
I think about him on alternate Thursdays

He's got a problem if he thinks I need him
I couldn't care less now that we're through
I only sit home and I wait for his phone call
When I haven't got anything better to do

Wasn't I awfully smart not to fall and break my heart
He never meant a thing to me, he's gone
I'm glad, I'm free
And when he kissed me, no no he never moved me
Nothing fantastic, thrilling or new
So if I'm crying, I'm only crying

Where are the sleigh rides to dawn?
Where are the tender moments of splendor?

Blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams

And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
In the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trout stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me",Lazy Afternoon [From the Golden Apple][*],2008

Eddie from Ohio,"Daddy oh daddy
Is that you behind the screen
I recognize some scratches
In this frame of olive green
Now this old door has always
Kept our family from harm
What would it take to unlock it
And find your outstretched arms

look at me it's your prodigal kid
But don't go and slaughter the calf
You've not seen the likes of me
For one year and a half
Somehow bad breaks and big mistakes
Have driven me to tears
My conscience aches I hope this makes
Some sense to your fresh ears

look by me it's my roadtrip friend
And by the way my spouse
Our occupation's travel
And our chevy is our house
We dig the dead and just got wed
In vegas back in may
We don't do much to keep in touch
That's why I must say

you can yell at me and laugh
We'd argue 'til the dawn
You can pull my photographs
And throw them on the lawn
Now you don't owe me
Mister and I'm sure not your exemption
But I'm a buck twenty-five from bein' broke
And a hail mary shy of redemption

look at me it's your second born
But don't go and slaughter the lamb
I just dropped by to say hello
And tell you how I am
Some southbound deals
And makeshift meals
Have led me to your door
Could you arrange a fair exchange
For sleep upon your floor

chorus

buck twenty-five
Is that you behind the screen
Hail mary shy
The paint's a peelin' on this olive green
Buck twenty-five
A door that's kept our family from sin
Hail mary shy
Come and let your child in

Eddie from Ohio,"If I were a flintstone
I'd make myself some shoes
I'd set up shop and sell bedrock
My shoes sensible shoes
A pioneer of footwear
Lordy-be and bless my soul
I'd be a bc billionaire
The first you'd ever know

so load your wheels
With t-bone steaks
Keep in mind you got no breaks
It's no small feat
To stop your car
So mind the stops
Wherever you are
That you don't
Wear out your shoes

if I were mayor of bedrock
I'd write a law on shoes
I'd make the town of bedrock
All wear shoes sensible shoes
The maker of air freds
Lordy-be and bless my soul
I'd retire a bc billionaire
The first you'd ever know

chorus

and if I were a jetson
I'd throw out all my shoes
I'd set up cans for friends
To dump their shoes senseless shoes
A pioneer of callouses,
Lordy-be and bless my soul
I'd be a barefoot spaceman
The first you'd ever know

chorus",If I Were a Flintstone,1993
Eddie from Ohio,"It's a revolution of the darkest kind
I have seen it mirrored
In the darkening sky
I can put it in my hand
And hold it up to the light
But never see right through
It's a revolution in the purest form
And the house that we lived in's been tattered
And tom and my blanket
No longer keeps me warm
The cold it burned right through

wake up vanessa
There's someone at the door
With a carbine on his shoulder
He's talking 'bout
A revolutionary war
This is all about faith,
This is not about religion
Since when did making love become
A life and death decision?

it's a clean destruction of the previous mind
And all I believed in's been shattered in kind
But I found that my heart's opened up my
Mind and opened up my eyes
And it's no wonder that you found me here on
The side of the road with all I hold dear in a
Brass-metal casting to shut out the fear
And cut it down to size

chorus",Revolution,1993
Eddie from Ohio,"She on the left he on the right
They sit in there living room
Stare at the fire, sparks up the flu
Escape to the night, bedtime soon

and sure there's plenty to talk about
But there ain't much to say
God's on the mantlepiece
And what's he got to do
With all of this anyway

and the silence here is written
It's the holiest you've ever seen
These two just bookends
To the spaces in between

they say they can talk about anything
Unlike so many others they know
Three out of five end in divorce
A matter of course, they read it was so
They read it was so

she closes the book he puts out the fire
She turns down the bed, coming dear
They lie in the dark, listening to
Whispering ghosts in the downstairs room

Eddie from Ohio,"First it happened slowly
Then quickly came
Unveiled as madness
Disguised as something sane
He never meant to
He wrapped her up in his life
She stuck to it like glue
Round and round they spin
Weaving in the night
Tapestry will envelope them
They'll fight the good fight

one heart cannot hold all of this
One man's grace is another man's hell
Two souls can melt together
'til one can no longer find itself

they kept up appearances
For family and friends
He coveted her soul
She put up no defense
We all began to notice
Unmistakable signs
They were never in the same room
At the very same time
And in the hiding of their bedroom
One hybrid voice was heard
Two would shed their clothing
One body would emerge

Weaving in the night
Tapestry will envelope them
They'll fight the good fight

Eddie from Ohio,"You think you'll find some mountains 
In western colorado
Fifty weeks of snowy peaks
Is where you're gonna be
But babe the rocky mountains are gradually eroding
The hills of coors are nothing more
Than blue ridge wannabes

a turkey on it's belly
A chicken on it's back
Anyway you look at it 
You'll find her on the map
She revels in the seasons
Shakes hands with the north
Hugs the land of dixie while dancing on the porch

you think that autumns in new england
Are the greatest of them all
But give me sweet virginia for the fireworks of fall
The prettiest October in all the fifty states
Just drive up to the skyline 
Park the car and wait

so grow up colorado
Excuse me tennessee 
If you don't mind, north caroline
Here's where I want to be

(chorus)
When you're talking home 
You mean the old dominion
Just southeast of heaven to the surf and the hills
She's the best of thirteen sisters
And thirty seven more
Sweet sweet virginia always keeps an open door

they're fiddlin' in galax
Pickin' up in floyd
And in the land of patsy cline
They're songs you can't avoid
When you're walking back after midnight
I'll fall to pieces, too
I'm crazy back in baby's arms with sweet dreams of you

they're sailing down in norfolk
Skiing up in bryce
Climbing up the devil's stairs against the ranger's advice
They're harvesting in loudoun to shenandoah winds
And in the land near washington they're rooting for the 'skins
Fight for old d.c.

so grow up colorado
Excuse me tennesse
If you don't mind, north caroline
Here's where I want to be

(chorus)

pack up your impala
And make your move out west
Past the blue ridge mountains 
You'll find you passed the best
And when your dreams have ended
Where mountains are concerned
Me and sweet virginia will await for your return

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1998
Eddie Gomez,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on

Eddie Gomez,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star,1998

Eddie Gomez,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
