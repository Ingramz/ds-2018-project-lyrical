Nelly,"'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
Yeah,I can't shake it, no

I can't wait to see you
want to see if you still got that
Look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same thing
Over and over again

Oh but I think she's leaving on
And she's leaving here
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath
You took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you
Or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps
Playing in my head
Over and over again
It play in my head
Over and over again

Oh but I think she's leaving on
And she's leaving here
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, 'cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again
And I can't take it
I can't shake it, no

Now that I realize
That I'm going down
From all this pain you
Put me through
Every time I close my eyes
I lock it down
Oh, I can't go on not loving you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad

And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

Well well well, yeah

[Chorus: R. Isley]
There's this girl, and, I see her every day
But she don't know me (she don't know my name)

The one that's gon' take her away

[Nelly]
Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo it's three in the morning and the party's still going
Bass still knocking, ""Pimp Juice"" still flowing
'Tics in the back, you can smell the chronic blowing
I got girls all around, I got my Hef' game going
Baby girl right but her partner got ass
Baby girl left but her partner got ass
She got 'em stuffed in them boy shorts covered up with lil' hearts
Her partner got 'em laced, cut right below the waist
You can tell they got taste by they ensemble
One like to salsa, the other the mambo
Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?
They like to work out, and I ain't talking Tae-Bo
They like fast cars, I ain't talking Volvos
They both are the devil but they like it diablo
Don't worry got it covered just listen to Ronald

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
She say them suckers agitate her, told her I'm a regulator
Man I want to lay down with ya, maybe we can do it later
I ain't got no time to waste, another move I got to make
Cold thing, she ain't even know my nizzame (damn)
I didn't even have to say it, baby want to stop and play it
Rewind that, pop and grind that
You'll find that, a woman like yourself can't keep cumin by yourself
Get in where you fit in, now enjoy yourself
Cute bright skin brown skin take me to the mountain
Get you wet like a fountain
Then get your counseling, have a seat have a drink have a toke
It's a ""Doggy Dogg World"", you can have whatever you want
Or whatever you need, all you got to do it follow my lead
Take my hand, and roll with me
And live it up, with a D-O-double-G, lavishly

[Chorus]

[Ron Isley]
Hey girl, what's yo' fantasy?
Can I take you home? I want you here with me
Ooh girl you blow my mind, I want to be yo' freak

Yo, I want to explain something to all the, squares out there
They may not know what 24, wood grain and leather with a hole is
24 inches or twenty-four inch rims in diameter

Leather is like your seats
And the hole is what they call a sunroof
Or maybe a three-way power hole

Deerty ent dammit, got more bread than a sandwich
And my writst got more nuggets than Carmello and Camby

Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the arts
So tours look for me like an important part
Find your talent use your talent get your money
Or don?t find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy

But that don't owe me cause I built it from scratch
My next shit is a house with a house in the back
Man I'm been while since middle school
I was that little dude that been round more waist lines than hoola hoops

You can even wait 'til the mountain comes down
And if you want to wait 'til the river runs dry

Hey yo this chronic got me to', I try to shake it and break it
Thinkin' it won't go, I went to see the doctor
X-rays it won't show, I even wrapped myself up in blankets
Just like a cold 'cause I'm so sick-wid-it

It just happened on a song, I feel it in my eyes
My yours and in my nose, my fingers and my toes
Translated into flows, man rap gon' need a face lift
I'm just so hungry I can taste it

Imagine me up in the sto', somewhere behind the counter
Pushin' buttons on the drawer, like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Chk-chicka, here you go, please come another day
I waited a lot of winter days and summer nights to rock the mic

City locked down, right before me and the other 'Tics went down

But leave it up to Moses, cause he goin' lead us out
I made the world accept on how we speak and how we shout

The whole world know I killed it but I still get acquitted - mayne

Cause they know that the nigga on fire fire fire fire

High definition to any form of telecast
Me and young dirty got plenty hoes and hella cash
All I need is a minute to ""Shatter Your Dreams""
And we about to sell more than Avril Lavigne (bitch!)
And all I do is rep the hood where the jugs be

Since he fronting like it's nothing, let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been getting ? since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lying, you claim you buying but you renting and leasing
If you pimping and niggas spending, where's the paper you seeing?
Stop stalling, I'm balling, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe

Did you hear that Elizabeth? here come the big one!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a general custard
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer, in just two records

Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be running
I'ma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothing
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a) in me

I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playing for his hometown, repping for the home ground
And getting buffer like Michael Riggs, tell 'em again
I gets buffer like Michael Riggs, heard what I said?
The m-v-p of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shooting out from my reign, with Peyton Manning type aim
Can't stop me from scoring so they results are just hacking
So there's, three of us now,- me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been raven about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin' or if I'm sittin' and readin'
Waitin' for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a brick, man
Ain't no way they blow, know, ain't no way they can, know
Ain't no way they can, know, ain't no way they can, know

It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin' what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin'
I've been dogfightin', scratchin' and clawin' on every height
I'm gonna to make you remember me like you 'Remember The Titans'
Cause I'm a warr-ior, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young black and rich
As good as it gets, and givin' your point guard fits

The crib off limits, got wifey durr
Got a man home beast, then be easy ma
She don't know how to creep, I be teachin ma
I got jars of that haze, yeah I'll show you how to twist

Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick
I'll show you which end to burn, how to spot that trick
All you need is the will to learn
.. and some good trees to burn
Relax, you'll be straight like a perm, word

[Chorus]
I need a man, who's up on his game
And can give me some affection, satisfy me many ways
Are you the one to do it for me playa?
Are you the one to do it for me playa?
Then maybe I can hook up witcha later

Babe girl you now rockin with strength, Infamous Thugs is nuttin to slug
Anyone, they try to ruin our fun
I don't want to scare you away, I'm sayin wha**up
Tell your friends come over here, and party with us

If why'all from the hood, why'all gon' love our ways
Cause we got money, and we still the same way
Go 'head, do that dance, and you can feel free
To be you and just do you, everything's great

Yeah tonight we gon' have a little too much to drink
Just leave your car in the lot, so you can feel safe
We goin' party 'til six then take it to my place
Then later on I'll have a car bring you back safe

I ain't into games, I'll give it to you straight
We can have a part time love, I just want it straight
Really doe, I changed doe, not no dames
So however you want to call it, it's okay

[Chorus]

Uhh, uhh, aiy
Check it, check it, check it
Baby girl right here is where you need to be
You better duck cause the bottles pop easily

Go and get your other friends, cause you comin with me
Dirty E-N-T with the M-O-be	
See, no respect for the +Country Grammar+
So I kick the Dunn language, the response was better

We like, 'Dunn' did it, 'Dunn' hit it, 'Dunn' split it
Everything hon wanted, Dunn was with it
She like to see me doo-rag'd and me ball-cap'd
She like to see me tailored, Gator'd, slacked

In fact, I see you lookin through the windshield wipers
As the rain hit the windows on the blue Dodge Viper
The sniper, not never but hit ya from long range
Check it, got haters like X had Brother Baines

Used to have quarter thangs but now I got quarter games
Got a quarter of a movie, here come {?} trains

I'm not tryin to be your girlfriend you dig
I ain't even tryin to lock you in
There's no need for us to pretend
I'd rather spend yo' dividends

You and me can be lover friends
I'd rather keep this between us two
Let me know when you want to begin
And let me tell you what I want from you

Got the world wide cell to check the e-mail
Plus 41k plan in ATL got 8 females

The only player who can ball without his ACL
Who may not be original but still a dunn da da

You go head and take the train and I'm gone take the chopper
I'm tired of niggas fronting like they top gun shockers (this is)

Shoot, they thought a dirty wouldn't make it this far
Now I'm supporting my family they liking who I are
Schoolboy hard worker they consider him a star
I guess that's why they look at us as if we from mars
Singer la ling I deal wit bars like a weight trainer
Hustlin' got me bigger like weight gainer
A once remainder, St.Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her 
Shoot, I'm just that dude that kick bars for a living
Get rich and trick collect cars for a living
Houses on hills, wit great lakes in the back
Bowling alleys and basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn look at the leather in that old school Lac' 
Baby doo doo green, I wonder who al' do that
The original rude dude, considered to cool 
Probably know me from touching your booty at school (Bling)

Two hundred million fella, call me a fortune tella
Trying to get over Eazy, like they was Jerry Heller
I never want to jail-ah, cause I'm too slick a fella
Seen me on wheels before, man you should see me now
It might be hard though, because I sit too high
I sit up on the hill, but I'm still down to earth
I'm like the Rams man I'm at the best when on my turf
You watch your girl flirt, you watch your girl tease
You think your girl want cheese? Then check your girl knees
You need to check her needs, before I check 'em for ya
Cause once I check her needs, she won't be checking for ya
You hear a knock knock, who is it that's, paying a visit
She's, going ballistic while he's, sipping on her Mystic
Whoa, it's the exquisite one named Mo, or short for Moses
I think I'll go back to counting my money now

Say I don't come to the hood, what do the fuck they know?
Who else driving that Bentley, out there in front of Wo's
Sitting out in front of Tandy, I got my phone handy
Give me the numbers I'ma call 'em, you been missing for 'em
I'm buying bikes for tykes, there'll be some uniforms
While they just rap about we fo' sho' fo' kids and show 'em
At elementary schools, the day of show and tell
We didn't come to show, mo' like we came to tell
Tell 'em how to keep it strong, on how to keep it tight
To tell they right from wrong, to turn your wrong right
Watch all they words and actions, thoughts companies and habits
Leave them tricks for rabbits, that greed for the savage
And you can make it happen, if you just don't give up
I guarantee that you can be that anything you want
Give 'em that real talk, show 'em that real walk
And maybe one day you can be like me, somewhere

Poppin' bottles, blowin' money, we ain't learn how to act
All in the V.I.P. spendin' four or five stacks
You can tell it's T.I.P. from how I bend my hat
Send the waitress to the bar but she comin' right back
Bet a shot of x-o'll get you on the right track
You got yo girl with you, better hold her hand, I'm a mack on attack
Turn yo head and she bound to get snatched
Give the dick to her once, get her hooked like crack
Takin' cum in the face, yea I like it like that
Holdin' on to her waist while I hit it from the back
If she come wit 'Pussy Popper' she ain't never comin' back
Rough sex, talkin' dirty, yea she into all that

Ain't no fuckin' way I'm leavin' here alone girl

Done tryin' t ball ma, I own a damn team
Even with a noose nigga still can't hang
Let me tell you who I'm is
Lunatic mayne, straight up out the heartland
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand
In different colors man, worth a couple hundred grand
Damn mama, how you do that there?
How yo waist stay still but you move that there
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there
Check it, okay let's have some fun
I got four G's and 5 five G's in one

You ready to get loose, shawty, better be
Sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo feet on the concrete merely
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'ma let her be
Why should I let that worry me?
Too many bitches cherish me
Pimp til I die, be a playa til they bury me
Renegade, I'ma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches anyday
Slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex
Got yo girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X
Head Pussy Popper, so all them expect
The best sex, and that's what all of them get

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Cause I was born to have it

In my life, money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when it's movin' slow
I ain't afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes

[Verse 1: Mase]
See the charm is global, the ice on my arm is oval
Money stacked in the back like it's Barnes and Noble
I know a girl Colorado, half of mulatto
Said I was hollow till I bought her a Murado
Some call me Ma$e and some call me Doller
Some came to hate and some came to holler
Followed by a mode,l I ain't even cop a bottle
See me GP and I ain't even hit the throttle
Mansion not listed, why'all got me twisted
Only young boys shop at the district
I hop out of big things rocky wristed
Now everybody thinking I'm domestic
Uh, grown mine, I need to chrome mine
Why yall go lease, I need to own mine
I stay so fresh I need my own line
So if money involved I need a hundred for mine

[Verse 2: Mase]
I know the pros and the cons to the smoking dons
See I'm laid in the shade to the Boca rotund
And people want to beat me with they open arms
But could it be my Rolls or my frozen arm
I'm like whoa man, mind I remember, I fear no man
Put chicks on the floor like a slow jam
With God on my side I fear no man, I'm deprogrammed
It's like I don't really care what another man think
Love to spend many so I understand
Money in the bank so I understand
Excuse me miss your standin' on my mink
My rock so big it jams up the sink
You can't call me sissy cause my whole hand pink
Enough ice in this to make a man blink
You think I care about what he think
Here we go

Now you be the middle man, I'ma be the money man
This flow right here, I know you don't understand
Power to get wealth, part of the covenant
I'm not your man, don't front me about your government
Why'all do it why yall way, I'ma do it God's way
Forget the house I put a million on the driveway
Clothes every spendin' winnin' dressed up in funny linen
Grinnin' while I spendin' givin' to men and women
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And we gonna get some lunch
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And you ain't seen me in sixty months

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def

All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would

Just say

Its the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold

I done fought through the battle, and I made it this far 
I got a few more feet but its still the longest yard 

Man its the longest yard I ever had to get in my life 
See my life ain't right if my wife don't write 
My nigga can't eat if the fish don't bite 
My raise the gross sales like Mike 'n' Ike 
A big brother all mighty I keep gamma ray on my G five g 
Takin G five Jeep, G five deep 
To ????????? 
Listen man they lock it down round here 
See body bag, ya gag, then ya frown round here 
This is serious as the sound round here 
The guards guard the ground fo pounds round here 
And they ain't playin' they just layin' old 
And anything that would've happen 
Nigga happen real slow 
Get the word from upstairs, tell you in that hole 
I can't take it I'm just ready to go 

[Chorus:]

I'm in my cell twenty hours a day, doin' push ups every hour of a day 
Cause I'm tryin' to keep the cowards away 
That's why I'm markin' off the calendar days 
Tryin' to get it outta the way 
Yea, and I'm just tryin' to keep a peace in mind 
And try not to strike a mother fucker with a piece of mine 
Cause he try to take a peace of mine 
So Imma slice him one piece at a time 
But now they close the doors, lock me in 
In a cell thirty feet but is built for ten 
Tell me what kinda world they got you in 
With a barbwire fence to box you in 
From now till they turn off the lights 
See I'm read everything in sight 
Its kinda hard tryin' to read at night 
But Imma change my life 
And help another brother take this flight 

[Chorus:] 


Oh no, I gotta make it out this place some how 
Oh no, man I really believe I can turn it around 
Oh no, you see all I need is that second chance to show 
Since incarceration, my obligation of rehabilitation 
Oh no, punch me high kick me low 
Oh no, its gonna take more than that for them to break my soul 
Oh no, man its hard for people to understand what its like to be gated, incarcerated, most can't take it but Imma make it to see betta days 

[Chorus:]

If I could I'd turn around

Nelly,"It's been a minute that I've been sittin' up in this cell
Thinkin' of many ways that I can get paid escapin' jail
My life is like a football game, I'm movin' the chains
Tryin' to score so I could maneuver the Range

I hear police callin' my name, I ball in no lane
Tryin' to hit the wall, make the ghetto hall of fame
It's third and long, got a lot of yards to gain
I'm federal, youse a misdemeanor, you small change

It's that, S W A N G affiliate
From the penitentiary to the club, love I'm sendin' it
Turn me out and throw it up and get your boogie on
And let me see those fingers in the sky if you feelin' it

I'm sick and ain't no curin' me, maximum security
Can't stop my back bumper draggin' through your community
Process me, lock me down, level me hard kid
I still come out swingin' like Ron Artest, nigga ha ha

Is it the concrete or the walls?
Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards
Nigga this is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down
This is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down

Is it the concrete or the walls?
Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards
Nigga this is lockdown
I'm 'bout to whip yo' ass mayne, ha ha

Nigga the bang bang get up
Skip skippin' through the lane, swang, look at Dub
Swangin', still feelin 'em all, I can't wait to get out
When I touch-down nigga, I'ma turn shit out

Looka there, biddy-by-by, buh-by-by beddy-bye nigga
Lights out, Dub and Nelly 'bout to shut the lights off
C-walkin' on the industry, spittin' with all my energy
Dedicated to my niggaz in the penitentiary

Ladies bounce to this, sip Cris', get drunk to this
Refs walks to this, dawgs thump to this
On my mind is my fetti, itchin' for the day
That I can parole and jack the nose on a Chevy

Three-wheel to the St. Lou' and connect with Nelly
Jump in the Escalade on them deuce-four Pirelli's, nigga
Money is freedom and freedom is cash
And anything between me and my freedom I'll whup an ass, ha ha

Is it the concrete or the walls?
Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards

This is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down

Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards
Nigga this is lockdown
I'm 'bout to whip yo' ass mayne, ha ha

Yeah, Dub stay chuckin' the pavement, I'm anti-general populated
Hood related, the industry most hated
'Cause I ball greedy and rhyme for mine, c'mon I'm willin' to die for mine
C'mon, while haters hate from the sideline

I'm like Fabolous, I make you 'Breathe' hard
Leavin' ya bleedin' and scarred, PC'd up on the sensitive knee guard
Dub Central ain't no surrender, spit for repetitive offenders
Facin' D.A.'s with public defenders nigga, ha ha

Damn girl I ain't seen you since prom,
Come to think about it I can't believe its been that long,
I heard your man locked down now how long he gone.... Oh dat long

How the hell he get time like that?
Three strikes with possession, aww he ain't comin back,
He left you with 2 kids and bills all around,
Plus you found out he had another chick cross-town,

It's always the darkness right before the sun rises
And you gotta stay strong for the kids in their eyes and
Please don't despise and go against all brothers and
Have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another,

With his sign will work for food, clothes or cash
and he asked if he could pump my gas, so I let him
Clean the windshield and throw out the trash, so I let him (Hey)

I even asked a brother his name, where he was from, got kids man and what's their ages
He kinda stuttered for a second, 
he kinda looked surprised that anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said young brother dem the only words I done heard in the last year that wasn't no or get the fuck away from herrre
How could somthin so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation? (Hey)
You could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in the title fight and this might be his last round

Until I realised life had to be planned by me, see that's the key
I only deal with what I can see cause over history, mystery brought us nothin but misery
Man more people done died in the name of the lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gangwars
Before guns there was swords and they was killin each other
and what's changed to this day still killin each other
Killin a brother while another mother cries for help
Man! we need to help a brother find themself

yeah we sippin', dippin', tippin', elbow swangin' out the window
Swimming pool up in the roof, I got the suede up in the ceiling
'88 dope man, not purple rain-rocks, having things, diamond chains
Doin' it till my money came
South side, west side, east side, north side, 
on them wires, on the blades

Everybody smokin' haze
Cadillac, Chevy, Escalade, and them Hummer trucks
We burnin' rubber, runnin' lights, we don't give a fuck
We on that laffy taffy, y'all niggas be smokin', babby
We custom fitted from our sneakers to our clothes daddy
We keep them hoes lookin', starin', gawkin', talkin' 'bout us
We got them peoples and feds, yea they talk about us
About the way we talk, about the way we dress
How 'bout them diamond grills? How 'bout they lookin' fresh? 
I'm always smokin' good, I'm posted on the lot
A pocket full of money, I'm fresh up off the block

So many brand-new niggas, we don't know who to trust
A bunch of pussy-ass rappers tryin' to sound like us
Sweet Jones is a pimp I got bitches on track
Send a hoe out on a mission, tell 'em break 'em, bring it back
Got a house in Hawaii, 'bout to, 'bout to buy a Rolls
Nigga think we just 'bout rapping bitch but dope is getting sold
I'm a young, hot street flame, deep up in the d-game
Smokin' bro, slammin' Cadillac doors, red paint switchin' lane-to-lane
I ain't came to lose bitch, I done paid my dues bitch
Got fifteen years off in this muthafuckin' rap shit
Seen a lot of niggas come, seen a lot of niggas go

I seen some niggas blow, I seen some turn to hoes
Candy cars, candy doors, I got yellow hoes that play wit' they nose
If ya like, she blow in ya butt
Eat ya dick and then lick ya nuts
If I wasn't rappin' baby, I'd still be drivin' this shit
Makin' hoes hide this dick, UGK we live in this bitch
Swisha sweets is a must 
Mixin' purple wit the tux
We call it banana split
Choose a pimp hoe, I'm the dick
I got Bobby 'bout a pound, nigga Whitney 'bout a key
DJ Screw about a gallon, bitch the game belong to me

In '72, a player born in his boots
Every line is the Gospel, 'cause every word is the truth
Some may call me the realest, this from the heart you can feel it
Project baby 'cause my family from the Car-Swerve Village
And moved the north side city wit this downtown witty
That influenced, project grew 'n' then now '88 gritty
Twelve years old smokin' squares, and by thirteen smokin' water
By fourteen I was a busy boy in somebody daughter
Rockin' them black Stacy Adams and that fresh gold hat

I'm sellin' weed a year later, whoa, here come the crack
I'm sellin' 50's and bopper's the cluckers say I got good
And wit the crack came the gangs, and that divided the hood
And then the war jumped off, some niggas didn't make it a summer
The other niggas locked up, doin' rides, receivin' numbers
I changed my life wit the quickest, for real and laid down the D
I ain't sellin' no mo' but you can still catch me in the hood

I'm from the middle of the map where the river run deep
Up I-55 where them niggas run D
Got a pocket full of stones along wit Bun B, Pimp C
Love didn't have it, I could get it from Three
Papi didn't have it, I could get it from E
Niggas need dank, you can call on me
Hell I come through, it don't matter if you on that 
south side, west side, east side, north side
Used to open up my trunk like there it is, 
let ya pick which one ya need to get loose

I beat that block like bad kids, yea you might wanna call that block abuse
Dirty then, made Derrty now, some of y'all might know, but don't blurt it out
You know how shit travel, word of mouth, have them kick-in boys all in my house
Knockin' down my glass door, tryin' to rip up my marble floor
But ain't nothin' that for that ass though you know
See that's throwback like Dukey Rope
Candy painted, hundred spokes, baking soda, watch it grow
Gangsta, gangsta? Neva that, but I keep that thing like 'Where he at?'
Ain't no rubber band big enough to hold these stacks

They tryna get a glimpse of what the hell is over there
Then pop, pop, pop, go a round of bottles
Then pop, pop, pop, R. Kelly follows
This shit here like hard to swallow

Only real niggas give paper showers, 3 or 4 grand like every hour
And I don't give a fuck who else in town, midwest come through shut this bitch down!

Nelly,"Yo, what you tell a motherfucker with two black eyes?
Nothing, you done already told his punk-ass twice

D, E, R, R, T, Y (we back, we back, we back)
We all we got, yo, know I want y'all do?
Yo

Hey yo stand at attention, raise your right arm, salute
Roll the carpet out, watch all the Bloods ""woot-woot""
Watch the Crips loc' it up, we back, we got our focus up
St. Lunatics, nigga know that, know that
Supreme team, if we lose you open your minds
Start readin' some things, we got it, holla at us, c'mon
Easy with that murder murder murder, kill kill
We did that back when I was born, Bill Bill
But I still do the knowledge, let me give you the math
I rock a seven-and-a-half for my seven-and-a-half
I be with Moses and Cain and Abel puttin' in work
I slap a nun, beat the reverend up, spit in his church
My derrty niggas come through, we turn the heat up in June
We at the party mackin', even throw a bitch in the room
Menage-a-trois, Murph' is ?, me and Law
'Cause we the baddest motherfuckers that you seen thus far, so

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga chill (chill) calm down (calm down)
Watch your words (watch your words) don't let your mouth get ahead of ya
You really talkin' reckless right now (right now)
And we know you ain't built for that (nope)

Look, learn, listen, check it
Start your cars up, trick your broads out
Pump your hard up, homie now put your guard up
You throw that one-two but, look how I jab you
No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to
You was doin' a lot of talkin' (yup) a lot of barkin'
But your bite was nothin', guess you mighta been frontin'
Yo ain't no mic to it, City see right through it
I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt
Don't, test me though, homie I might do it
Check my track record, the feelin' go right to it
It was easy for me, I was born to win
You was born to hate me, you should be born again
You with Mike and Kevin, we with Law and them
You cop American cars, we cop foreign 'em
Take a look at us dirty, we put the star in them
No slow stray bullets nigga, we Brett Favre'n them

You gots to chill, and let your conscience be free
Lil' boy, obviously y'all ain't fuckin' with Ky'
You see I stays real high, but I be's low-key
I'm so allergic to the line everybody know me
You know what? (What?) Why shouldn't y'all hate?
'Cause y'all so half decent, we Frosted Flakes great
And these ain't came out yet, I know y'all so late
I smoke zips, you pop 8's, damn what a waste
My lady is so happy, yours masturbates
You wash up in a sink, nigga I bathe in a lake
The way y'all copy our style ASCAP should make y'all pay
But they don't, so I'ma smoke a joint and get to the point
The motherfucking point is keep my name out your mouth
Unless you sayin' how we repped the Lou, since we came out
We've been winners since we came out, yo' mouth keep my name out
You don't wanna see thirty cardinal birds with they things out

[Chorus]

Murphy Lee God-body (like) take shit from nobody (nope)
Nelly bought it for me so that's my Maserati (yup)
Y'all know about me, I'm so far from sloppy (dirty)
You not a female nigga, so how can you top me?
My style can't be copied people trust me (trust me)
Even though you look like me, your flow musty (musty)
That means you stinkin', what you think's extinct
Been gone too long to even dig up the bones
I'm on my new-new, upgrade the kush from the doo-doo
That's a big step, but that's how niggas from the Lou do
Last rap was too cool, but this one is too damn hot
You wack rappers think you hot when you not (this is why I'm hot)
All this I talk slick shit as if you really did shit
Thinkin' you deserve my spot, well there it is then
Gave niggas time but now I'm back with a few of my friends
Lunatics 'bout to do this again, oh

[Chorus:]

Uh, tell you somethin'
You should see their faces when I walk in the facility
Mean mug, what's the purpose of you ice-grillin' me?
You're killin' me but really B, you ain't on my radar
Always used the right amount of strokes, that's why I stayed par
I ain't no killer lil' silly nigga but they are
You got the same ride as me but that's just my day car
My decor, might be Levi's and a A-R
Fifteen G's in my pocket just to play cards
So meet me in the casino, way in the back
Me and her fleein' the scene, away in the 'Llac
She say she feelin' her bean, a green of a stack
She say she like it obscene, I'm way in the knack
In fact, you niggas ain't like me, you salty (no)
Me, I'm like pepper cause I spice shit up
The Flavor Flav of the game cause I hype shit up
Might call my hundred watt niggaz in to light shit up
You better chill

I just touched down at this LAX
I'm looking for these girls on this LAX
Trying to find them niggas with that LA best
Dodging them niggas with that LA Stress
See I'm a visitor I'm a LA guest
I got to be aware on how the LA dress
'Cause if it comes down I might get LA stretched
I ain't trying to be a trophy on no LA desk
Some niggas walk up tossing LA sets
I guess this supposed to be some type of LA test
Better watch the girls with the LA chest
A lot of plastic in those LA breasts
I hit the Crenshaw where they LA stunt
Seen a lot of sixty four's and LA trucks
Seen a lot of girls with them LA butts
A lot of niggas with them dickies and chucks (ya feel me)

[Chorus]

Yo I spend a lot of time on this LA coast
Out here trying to do the LA most
Chauffeur driven Phantom like a LA ghost
In the back with a drink take a LA toast
I spend a lot of time in them LA heels
With them models actresses and them LA heels
To my lawyers office for a LA deal
Cut the check for some LA kneels
Now I'm off to Rodeo just to LA shop
Still getting dirty looks from some LA cops
You than thought since Rodney King LA stopped
When they burn the LA watts
I send a lot of love to my LA brothers
My Latinos and my Negroes in them LA colors
My blessings go out to those LA mothers
Know that Nelly is an LA lover

[Chorus]

Guess who just stepped in the place (the Midwest)
It's your OG homie Nate (all day)
My homie snoop and Nelly (La)
And we all up in your face (all day)
Different questions everyday (the Midwest)
I got my answer in my way (all day)
Yeah they all got something to say (LA)

This track remind me of when the studio was down ? in they basement
My shit was far from legal
Wrong place I'm a deal with regal
Check under that seat look in that lil box in the trunk sure illegal
Hold up better pump your brakes
You don't wanna make no mistake
Running up on the wrong nigga and the wrong time might get you something hot in your face
And I ain't talking bout no mase
I'm talking that shit that chase
That shit that a run ya down and take pheresnic files gonna solve that case
I hear a lot of that I did this
I hear a lot of that I did that
But why it funny when you take the stand and point at his man like he did that
You wanna stand looking so not gangsta
Plead to the judge ""I'm so not gangsta""

See it's best you play your part
You don't try to be who you aren't
Ain't gotta prove anything to me motherfucker I know you ain't got no heart

He just flew the coop and got chickens he wanna move
But I'm a handle this

Before you get to management you gotta mop the floor
He's not a hustler

See I could put you in all them clothes
Your neck, wrist, ears, hands, all that froze
He could never ever put you in a rose
But anything goes when you dealin' with the baller
Stand on my money if I wanna be taller
Smack him with a G, I bet he go and get his lawyer
'Cause he really wanna sue me
Take the bitch route, cause he know he cannot do me
Know he can't outdo me in the records or the movies
Man, I don't want your girl, plus I heard she got the cooties
If you mean what you feel then I mean what I said
You don't like cheap sex, I laid a mil' on the bed
Spread it all out and we can roll around in it
Hop off in the whip and we can roll around in it
In the back seat and we can go to town in it
Or maybe on the hood, sound profound, did it?
He ain't get the message ma, act like he ain't get it
He ain't catch a hint when you gave him back his rented
Now his lil' condo one less tenant
And I did it, but you know what?

Me be the rapper, Nicky Bonds be the crack
Think I fell off when they fell from the track
You wanna come to Nellyville I'll draw you the map

Follow that rainbow of diamonds down to the gold
Follow shorty as she slide down a pole
He tryna make it rain but it's comin' down slow
I hope he got the gloves cause I'm about to make it snow

Like kids seein Santa when I walked in the club
(Hohh, hohh, hohhh...)
But I only brought presents for the girls
Listen, play with me nigga if you wanna, if you feel
Won't kill at will but will kill Bill
Somebody better grab Bill, tell him to chill
Before somebody find him buried in the hills

Then pop, pop, pop, more round of bottles
Then pop, pop, pop, R. Kelly follows
Then shit here like hard to swallow
Only real niggas here know dis power
Only real niggas give paper showers
Three, four grand like every hour
And I don't give a fuck who else in town
Midwest come through, shut this bitch down

No esta buena but it hits a penas
Makin money in prison why afuera
That's my business, my drawings what eva
Slangin hierba diez bolas al toke
Slangin ink con placazos al sobres
Slang my cornbread, dessert and a juice
Saw my homeboy get shot on the news
Now you know what this Mexican doos
Come and cruise, take a walk in my shoes
On the cool esta vida no es linda
That's your boy hittin licks in the pinta

We hit licks in the earliest of hours
Underneath the light and watchtowers
Be cool when you see the ghost
Don't be surprised, she's not in white clothes

Envelope with the money order, 50 should get me a mountain
Biness to handle when the bossman finish countin
Homie kinda broke and them folks call him indigent
Hustle out there, Hustle here, there's no sentiment
Sendin so many kites, call me Benjamin Frank
Service to everybody, 50 men in a tank
Meet my sister in the free, she gon send you a bank
While I make me a shank contraband drank
Food, snacks, basic commissary
Pay me for my picture of the what? naked Halle Berry
Home on a furlough, OG told me
Where he buried the dough, let it burn slow
6 months and I'll be free
But right now I got whatever you need, two for three
Broke and alone doin time comatose
I'mma shoot at the Bitch and see if she a Ghost

Pass the grass but don't let'em see you
My heavenly jewel riskin it all
The finest boss lady in these prison brick walls
Hit the lick ma, kiss the dick soft
Lemme see your phone for a business call
If it gets long pick it up before three
But put it on silent so it don't ring
I'm the digital king, this is no dream
Is it real love or just a physical thing
Like a typical fling while I'm sippin on lean
Bring back some chicken cause a nigga Hung-ry

So the judges can win their elections
They locking up the muthafuckin Mexicans
Back with my best friends and we go

or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face,
Next semester she transfer to Florida State
Cooking like home-etch for financial aid.
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid, remember
meantime my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the panantial states Boss
She used to fight with her moms till I sat em both down
Now she's tight with her moms (what?)
Yeah I put the ice on her arm,
Now she know she getting sliced spending nights in Milan (yeah)
We still blow weed together cheated on her but we still gone be together
With the house on the water hit the beach whenever
She's from the north and still can't believe there whether Boss

'Cause she can be my lady she can be my lover

The previous was a test for ya, now you in the big leagues
A black Steinbrenner who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell him I said it
He was talking a lot at first, but you can see that dead it
You can see I ain't sweat it,
Hell I'll even call him my self and tell him I dead it nah
Please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see if I could put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think your ass fine as shit and that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside

Nelly,"You're a warrior fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above and brought down the world below

You're the son of his majesty
Remember how it used to be
In the light of day it's easy to see
Now it's nighttime
You had to leave

Separated from the king
Now the water's rushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
And it seems, like your not moving the many water's gushing you gasp for air
Almost drowning ears ringing, once upon a time we were singing
One day the trees will stand and clap hands
Stream of thought getting caught in the klipa, this place is just a shell, external
Egos swell, that one'll burn ya, we fell a long way down, that eternal frown'll get you
You look vexed it's the dregs, the yetzer hara's lurking
Trying to make you forget we got a job to do
You're a priest and a prince and you can't be moved

[Chorus]
You're a warrior, fighting for your soul
Taken from a world above, and brought down to a world below
Re-united, re-united return the princess to the king,
Re-united, re-united, she's been taken for so long
Re-united, re-united and then she'll be filled with joy
Re-united, re-united like the days of her youth

Descended to the pit
What's this feeling can't get rid of it
Soul sick
Can't seem to shake it
When one retires at night weeping, joy will come in the morning
You made my mountain stand strong

[Chorus]

Like and ancient memory
Remember how it used to be
Close your eyes and breath in
That's the scent of freedom
Ringing across the sea
Land of milk and honey
One day will wake up from this dream and we'll stop sleeping,
Oh, yo, then we'll see clearly

You don't no broke nigga 
I don't want no broke bitch
Started it balling go quick 
I guess we on the same shit
She want me to wife her 
Maybe change her life up
Give the keys, shopping sprees 
Yea only if I like her
See money ain't the algebra let's get it clear, clear
This is not a gift it's a souvenir, nir
See maybe I'm that nigga who knows how to ball, I am
He Spud Webb height, but the money tall
Audemar his and hers
Body's straight hips and curves
Friends hanging on your nerves
Trying to tell 'em I don't want your girls
I'm come from another world
Money do not grow on trees
That's why I had to hustle her and get my money out the streets

[Chorus]

My money long money strong bitch I'm ? paid
I'm throwing shots back like it's k-k-kool aid
I got them co coo shades
Them shit is crazy dark
I got two shortys feeling on each others lady parts
Play your part
Know your role
That mustang cold painted Olympic gold
I cal her Elenore you know that Shelby rips
I'm gone in sixty ticks
T-t-t-t-ticks
Before my deal I cut 'bout sixty  chicks
Acrobatics got my money turning sixty flips
Old schools I be on that sixties shit
My nigga gone forever intent with sixty bricks

The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar,
System got us hopeless, and focused on foreclosures

But they gotta teach themselves how to reload

Sometimes it feels like I cant win
And even through all the rules keep changing, 
I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

Throwing her shit at me
A constant complain about every

For everyone I believed in
I was going insane, they were screaming our name
While were spraying champagne
There's nothing nobody can say

Is the day that I have always dreamed of forever

I can raise my hands
I can scream I'm the best in the world

Push up after push up, everybody count it out
Everybody up, now we back down
All my pain and sweat was for this moment right now
All from different places well we came with each other
We came together as a team,
But we're leaving as brothers
Standing next to one another while we hold up our colors
I'm gon' look in to the camera and tell my mama I love her

Is the day that I have always dreamed of forever

Calls 'em off, starts to yell

With a Mississippi flow and all in dress
And a four by four with the alter steps
Doing donuts underneath the old chest

Think I ride or I die down to six thirty
Straight up chick like twelve o'clock

She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song

We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer

Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

My windows down my seat back my music up when we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard, and that’s just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy like er’thing about ya
Don’t change a thing, no way, you stay the same I gotcha
Life’s all that, all that, head to toe you all that
Tell ol’ boy he call back, send a text say “fall back” (‘Cause)
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
So come on shorty let me show you what the fast’s like
Whippin’ cross the border Florida into Georgia
‘Cause baby you a song and you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every hood er’ry town with you
And this drop top Chevy painted real slick
It’ll look a hell of a lot better when you up in it (you up in it)
‘Cause baby you a song and you make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my (roll my) oh

Well baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio (Get the windows down and cruise)
I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio (Get my windows down and roll)

Nelly,"Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones
Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on his way
They closing in on me, I feel like every day
Music saves me, soothing like the navy
But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars
So I took the vibe with me using my life
Yep, I propose the main music my wife
If ever need to call a nigga music's my night
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice
If I degraded and I haven't even cried to
I watch purpose prophesize about going through
Music ain't the knowledge itself
And I'm the knowledge itself, then I acknowledge your wealth

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal lines
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me
I'm redefining the space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you, papa, when I google monogamy
Now all the people who go irresponsibly
Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy
So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use
Each of lyrical vestibule, let me tell you what's best for you
My music gives you a message true or respect is due
But music is emotion, that's lost for me intellectual
A tree in form of a far is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create the same
Of course you're nothing but a pair in making, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I was born on the afterbeat, I'm like ron for Johnson
When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it
Lauryn went, looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
Willing to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade the death like we got a fear of living
Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising
Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism
The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us

And he could run before he walked",Before He Walked,2013

Sitting on the top; it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV; just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over; not at least until we say

Hablando en alta voz
Hieres mi corazón
Yo, tratando de escuchar

Y me mandas a callar diciéndome
No me debo sorprender
Porque así es la realidad

Y yo
No tengo armas para enfrentarte
Pongo mis manos, manos al aire
Solo me importa amarte

Te dejaste llevar
Por la inseguridad

Nelly Furtado,"I'm talking to the mirror again but it's not listening
I'm cleaning my dirty mind like a toilet but it won't give in
I'm drinking spirits in the hopes that I will find myself one
But all I can rectify is that the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

I feel like falling asleep and never waking up
It's not that my glass is empty but I need another cup
When all of the doors around me just shut one by one by, one by one
I feel like falling asleep but the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Of limbs and tooth under my skin
Oh, freedom, where do I begin?

I'm changing my inflection
And how I say the words
Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard
Oh, death of the party

I picked up the chalice of malice
And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full
I was thirsty but I drank till I was full
I drank till I, till I, till I was full

There's a fever in my bones that I know so well
I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can, I'm cleaning up as fast as I can

Cause you can't unbreak what you break
You can't unfake the very fake
You cannot fuel without a tank
No, you can't unbreak what you break, what you break

You liked me 'til you seen me on your t.v.
Well if you're so low below then why you watching
You say good things come to those who wait
I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

But from your mouth I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it's a lot of yearning

Than to burn in the spotlight, open fire, turn in the spitfire, open fire
Scream without making a sound, open fire, be up here without looking down, open fire

I've seen him say to me that he is only mine
That he gotta do what is best for him
Never let me in, not even begin
To tell me I'm the one under his moon and sun
That I am the thing that revolves around him
But while on top of him I know what's best for him
I'll show him how to win and let me in because

It's just a little spat
Still I want you to know

It's mostly me dreaming, forcing, believing
That you're an ideal

But I stole you from
From another one

Don't you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now I'm so much more, can't you see? Can't you see?
Look who's writing now a token of their love
Can't you see love that it's just because
I wanted a cheap way to get inside your head

And not a cheap way to get inside your bed

You know I'm only testing you out.
Hey man, don't look so angry,
You're real close to figuring me out.

We are a part of a circle.
It's like a mobius strip,
And it goes round and round until it loses a link.
And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,
And shit is gonna fly once again.

Hey, man, we look at each other with ample eyes,
So why not some time to discover what's behind your eyes?
I've got so many questions that I want to ask you.
I am so tired of mirrors- pour me a glass of your wine!

And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,
And shit is gonna fly once again!
I've got a bunch of government checks at my door.
Each morning I try to send them back but they only send me more.
I look at myself in the mirror; am I vital today?
Hey, man, I let my conscience get in the way!

And there's a shadow in the sky , and it looks like rain,
And shit is gonna fly once again,
And I don't mean to rain on your parade,

Nelly Furtado,"I'm talking to the mirror again but it's not listening
I'm cleaning my dirty mind like a toilet but it won't give in
I'm drinking spirits in the hopes that I will find myself one
But all I can rectify is that the party's just begun

[Chorus:]
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

I feel like falling asleep and never waking up
It's not that my glass is empty but I need another cup
When all of the doors around me just shut one by one
I feel like falling asleep but the party's just begun

[Chorus]
Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Of limbs and tooth under my skin
Oh, freedom, where do I begin
I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words
Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard
Oh, death of the party
I picked up the chalice of malice
And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full
I was thirsty but I drank till I was full, 
I drank till I, till I,till I was full

There's a fever in my bones that I know so well
I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
'cause you can't unbreak what you break, you can't unfake the very fake
You cannot fuel without a tank, 
no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break

I know you'll shine much brighter than I ever could
Maybe that is why I was

Scared of you 
And in everything I do I'm still thinking of you
And I know you were scared of me too

Desculpa-me se te ofendi
Desculpa-me se te esqueci
Desculpa-me se eu te deixei
Eu te deixei
E desculpa-me por me sentir bem com a tua dor
Sabes que te adoro mas sei que a tua estrela é maior do que a minha, 
Do que a minha
E por isso

Eu tenho medo deste amor (os dias passo pensando em ti), amor

Nelly Furtado," I left my heart in San Francisco 
With some club kids on a crowded street somewhere 
The sky was red and he said, 
""Would you like to come be a part of my North American Dream?""
I could try to chase life down, down the street and I'd find the separation 
Of fact and fiction

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

I left my conscience somewhere with my rhythm
I heard about it from the mouth of a man
He was hopping some trains and combing the land
Looking for a lover (kiss) planted in the east
Trying to run from the dreaded fist beast
And it lies, it lies in the picket fence call
It was my own paradise with my own private corridor

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

So I'm dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed
My veins became a strain of light that I let to flow instead
And a wish came to me like Peter Pan at my window and said
Evolve your destiny child and you'll never walk alone-no
You'll never walk alone, but
Travel to the land of surrender till' you can't cry no more
Till you can't, till you can't
And you'll never walk alone

You'll nev, you'll nev, you'll never walk alone, you'll nev, 
You'll nev, you'll never walk alone
Never walk, never walk alone alone, alone
All this inspiration is passing me by
All I can do is chill when I really wanna fly
And this pollution do nothing but dirty up my mind
Faster than forever in the blink of an eye
To see past my lethargy is hard I feign
The beauty of my youth is 
Gone but the chemicals remain

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if I budge I just might

I travel to this land of surrender but I see it's all over me, over and over 
Again and I try and I try and I try an angel on my left side and a devil 
On my right and they fight and they fight and they fight they're fighting, 
They're fighting, they're fighting for my attention...hello? 
You have my attention
Do I have your attention
Can I have your attention please?
Please, you've made such, such an impression on me",Trynna Finda Way,2000
Nelly Furtado,"(People, people, people)

It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me you're better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (by the moon)

And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find

Nelly Furtado,"Well, well, what do I say
Looks like what goes around comes around
And everyone will have their final say
Sometime, someday
Looks like I only love God when the sun shines my way
Looks like I'm into divinity only when I can see its sweet, sweet rays

[Chorus]
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say
Well, well, it's fine out today
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say
Well, well, it's fine out

Well, well, what do I say
I've never seen a bad day look quite this way
And well, well, what do I do
When all of my thoughts run right back to you
Looks like I meant to speak with logic,
But hon', the carnal always gets in the way
Well, well, this fire was more funner than proper grammar anyway

[Chorus]

Then you get to the part where your heart just wants to die
Then you get to the part where your heart screams it just sighs
Then you get to the part where your heart knows it's a crime
So it flies like a bird, it's heard, it's heard, it's heard the word

Well, well, it's fine out","Well, Well",2000

What about the money that I spent up today [Repeat: x 4]

[Timbaland]
Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass
To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes
I brought you the private, ounce wit the gates

Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour

And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'
Sometimes while hittin' it ,different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss
Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips

But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta
No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters
If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed
Hun tonight is bet burgers, no cheese on the bread
And I say

Boy you act like I need ya, came down wit amnesia
Ran to why'alls in the meters, nuttin' but hate in between us
Now you come poppin' this shit, nigga I made you rich
Introduce you to Cris, flipped and secured your bricks

Even though them kids ain't mine, let 'em call me mami
I deserve them dollars, trip to the Bahamas and Porsche rotten
I washed your clothes, put up wit your hoes
Never fucked up yo dough, put the G in ya glow

So what you sweatin' me fo', I promoted them tours
I was poppin' them fours, run in and outta them stores
I cleaned up your spot, poured your brandy and scotch
Razor blades to the rocks, even lied to the cops

Played your wifey and mother, cousin, sister and brother
Accountant lawyer and lover, I'm through dealin' wit suckers
Shuttin' and lockin' the door, bout to settle the score
You wastin' my time, nigga, but what about my nigga

Boy money ain't everything, married minus the ring
Frequent Coach, mink, coats, cruises on ships and boats
I gave you way more, can't there bout all your bulls
Since day one it was ours it never was yours

Uh - look at the bigger picture, study the ghetto scripture
Held your back when you was broke frontin' 'cause now you richer
No frontin' in that there, Ms. Jade is everywhere
Enough talkin' I'm through, my lawyer will be callin' you

[Nelly Furtado]
All this money that he's spendin', you owe me everything
I want to tell him it's not his money, he tell me to go away, baby
Wish he'd only give me a chance to show him that I'm alive
I'm gonna be there and you need peace and tender all up in his life
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause as long as I believe

They'll truck 'em

Phenominal adrenaline
From the words of my mouth

How did Shayne manage to rap?
With brain damage I'm phat
Remain famished and stacked
Your playin' with the
Praying mantis

You sink like Titanic

So point to to whether it be easy enough to do

I let it ? like freedom
Swing letters from my jaw
Twenty six in the mix
An we do it better than ya'll

I'm a neanderthal
Your bound ta fall

Its foreign to why'all
Its wonderful the underworld

Drastic, it ain't plastic, it's just pro blackness
Grown man tactics no pediatrics
The kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
The catalyst. Thought with the knack of splashin'
I'm dashin', I mastered the craft of mashin'
The level-headed thoroughbred the females passion
Magnetic attraction be keeping em askin'

The crews in the Cadillac, the Pendergrassin'
Swerve half-naked won't come near crashin'
But if I go to Heaven would ya'll know my name
Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for your freedom dog, that's what's happenin'
My spit take critical political action
The hustle is a puzzle, each piece is a fraction
And every word that's understood is a transaction
I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder
Rep Philly set
From Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to Tip and Thai Yoga
How we gon' make it through the dark?
I'll show ya.

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
Listen,
If you want to be high

Yo kick off ya shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes from off ya block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins wit ya men's who you thought could box
A couple people wanted thought to stop
But guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time greedy stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lackluster
Gotta put it to ya straight
Y'all fools is jacked up
Came close to the utmost but no cogar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award-winning it's the world's eighth wonder
Come on!

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high

Yo, your first impression might be I'm a asshole
Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to suntouch and put the heat in a capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though,
I get in the zone, recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lollygag or lounge with scallywags
Gimme the disc or I'll put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks
With no apology, fraud or tricknology
Just trust what I see and I say and follow me
My way, I be the open book, look inside me
The star of the story that the grooveteller guide me
Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the true gon' sense it
I get in the zone

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly

Nelly Furtado,"[Chali 2na]
Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

[Chorus: x2]

[Soup]
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, what you doing after this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want, just, a touch

[Chorus: x2]

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't want to be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the room

[Chali 2na]
This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion

[Akil]
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

[Marc 7]
We was people to begin with, but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm trying to salvage a friendship

And it all comes to life so, so suddenly
This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause

I tend to run, I tend to hide, 'til I find you and I know I got you

With a lighter and some hairspray
Smoking in the girls' room

Or maybe back then we just thought that she was getting some

Now we look back and see that she didn't know how
We never thought that we'd get caught up
Stuck in the teenage waste

As we explode
As we explode

Then getting drunk in the bushes by the road outside the Kmart
Rolling around in them to see if you would get prickled
Slip the acid on your tongue rooftop mall parkade

Then count the stars and the ten million woes
Just you and the universe judging each other

Or maybe a traveling book
Wanted to get on that plane and fly away
cause you are a rock star deep down inside
You walk with a swagger, got nothin' to hide 
Cigarette in your mouth, a cuff on your jeans
Your sideburns are perfect, you're a perfect and lean
So you made an oil painting to immortalize
All of the hope and vision in your eyes
In your leisure coat and cowboy hat
North American records and so much to bat for

Please bring me along
Please bring me along
Because I want to see everything you have to offer me

Get a job lifting cement
Oh it's so dry when it rains it gets wet
And the village was great, now it's a suburb
You left behind half of all that you had learnt
Relearn a couple things along the way
The thrift shop so clean all for half what you'd pay
So you try everything on, on for size
Drop top your Camaro and go for a ride

Please bring me along
Please bring me along
Because I want to see everything you have to offer me

And I don't mind to sit here and waste my time
Oh but this world is not mine to define
And I want to shine

This is me
Damaged leg

Plastic cups

Lunch at noon

To help my mother
End her day

We got a lot

We're on our way
Roll the windows down 
And scream out loud
We're tired now

Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try

And all the real people are really not real at all

The more I cry the more I cry

Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try
Oh, try, try

We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be, we never will be

Nelly Furtado,"Estuve bien estuve mal
Tuve rabia tuve paz
Y todo lo que te-di
Por un tuvo se fue
En el cielo me senti
Y en el suelo me vi
Una vida asi
No es posible vivir

Quiero sentir-me mejor
Quiero sentir-me mejor
Carino mio sentirnos mejor
Por eso

Te busque de bajo de las piedras y no te-encontre 
En la manana fria y en la noche te-busque 
Hasta enloquecer 
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz 
Sanando las heridas de mi corazon 
Haciendo me-sentir vivo otra vez

No podia hablar
Ni tampoco comer
No queria cantar
No sabia que hacer
Esa herida sangro
Y mis ojos perdi
Pero ahora yo soy el futuro de los dos

I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer 
I wanna be myself but does the world really need her 
I ache for this earth 
I stopped going to church 
See God in the trees makes me fall to my knees 
My depression keeps building like a cup overfilling 
My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge 
It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes 
Cuz they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry

I've been high I've been low
I've been fast I've been slow
I've had nowhere to go
Missed the bus missed the show
I've been down on my luck
I've felt like giving up
My life locked in a trunk
When it hurt way too much
I needed a reason to live
Some love inside me to give
I couldn't rest I had to keep on searching

Te busque de bajo de las piedras y no te-encontre 
En la manana fria y en la noche te-busque 
Hasta enloquecer 
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz 
Sanando las heridas de mi corazon 
Haciendo me-sentir vivo otra vez

I've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat 
Been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings 
I've been hurt by my past but I feel the future 
In my dreams and it lasts I wake up I'm not sure 
I wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right 
I needed an answer to end all my searching

I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer 
I wanna be myself but does the world really need her 
I ache for this earth 
I stopped going to church 
See God in the trees makes me fall to my knees

That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand

'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low

Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Nelly Furtado,"I looked at your face
I saw that all the love had died
I saw that we had forgotten to take the time

I, I saw that you couldn't care less about what you do
You couldn't care less about the lies
You couldn't find the time to cry

We forgot about love
We forgot about faith
We forgot about trust
We forgot about us

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky
In heaven, where it began
Back in God's hands

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You say, 'baby, it's the end of the day.'

We gave a lot
But it wasn't enough
We got so tired
That we just gave up

Now our love's floating out the window
Our love's floating out the back door
Our love's floating up in the sky
In heaven, where it began
Back in God's hands, back in God's hands

We didn't respect it
We went and neglected it
We didn't deserve it
But I never expected this

Our love floated out the window
Our love floated out the back door
Our love floated up in the sky
To heaven, it's part of a plan
It's back in God's hands, back in God's hands

Oh, it didn't last, it's a thing of the past
No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had
Oh, I want it back, just what we had
I want it back, oh, just what we had",In God's Hands,2006

That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it
Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

No, you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free

I can't say that, I don't love the light and the dark

We've been waiting too long for this moment
I'll put on my best smile
I'm shining inside, and I'm proud of our love, but
Every time I turn around
You say that you're not checking for love in that way
But every time I come around you seem
So ready for this

Lights, camera, action; show what we're about 'cause it's

And I'm ready to put it all out there for you

So afraid of what people might say
But can't you see it's a game they play
Trying to cast a shadow on our love

I've been fast I've been slow
I've had nowhere to go
Missed the bus missed the show
I've been down on my luck
I've felt like giving up
My life locked in a trunk
When it hurt way too much
I needed a reason to live
Some love inside me to give
I couldn't rest I had to keep on searching

Te busqué de bajo de las piedras y no te encontré
En la mañana fría y en la noche te busqué
Hasta enloquecer
Pero tu llegaste a mi vida como una luz
Sanando las heridas de mi corazón
Haciendo me sentir vivo otra vez

I've been too sad to speak and too tired to eat
Been too lonely to sing the devil cut off my wings
I've been hurt by my past but I feel the future
In my dreams and it lasts I wake up I'm not sure
I wanted to find the light something just didn't feel right
I needed an answer to end all my searching

I look in the mirror the picture's getting clearer
I wanna be myself but does the world really need her
I ache for the earth
I stop going to church
I see God in the trees makes me fall on my knees
My depression keeps building like a cup overfilling
My heart so rigid I keep it in the fridge
It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes
'Cause they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry

You tonight you tonight

Nelly Furtado,"What they say what they say what they say

You speak out all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
'Cause this world is gonna always try us
And all you wanted was to run for cover
Well hereÂ´s looking to yourself and no other
WeÂ´re all searching for that special something
And we keep on running

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow
I want to feel the light shine on me

YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
But thatÂ´s okay 'cause youÂ´re only human
YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
But thatÂ´s okay youÂ´ll soon get strong enough
YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
But thatÂ´s okay cuz youÂ´re only human
YouÂ´re so afraid of what people might say
YouÂ´re going to break
So please donÂ´t do it

You wanna spread your wings but youÂ´re not sure
DonÂ´t wanna leave your comforts
Wanna find a cure
WeÂ´re afraid of who we see in the mirror
We wanna let got but it feels too pure
Who wants to be alone in this world
You look around and all you see is hurt
But the light it always guides us
If we move with a little trust

A diamond donÂ´t define what shine is
I donÂ´t need a Rolex to know what the time is
You got your let me find what mine is
IÂ´m a survivor look how strong my mind is
I stand on my own itÂ´s all me
Regardless of whatever they call me

Missed the bus, missed the show

I've been down on my luck
I've felt like givin' up
My life locked in the trunk
When it hurt way too much

I needed a reason to live
Some love inside me to give
I couldn't rest I had to keep on searchin'

Te busqué
Debajo de las piedras why no te encontré
En la mañana fria why en la noche te busqué
Hasta enloquecer

Sanando las heridas de mi corazón
Why haciéndome sentir

And too tired to eat
I've been too lonely to sing
Devil cut off my wings

I've been hurt by my past
But I feel a future
In my dreams and at last
I wake up, I'm not sure

I wanted to find a light
Somethin' just didn't feel right
I needed an answer to end all my searchin'

I wanna be myself but does the world really need her?
I ache for the earth, I stop goin' to church
I see God in the trees, makes me fall on my knees

My depression keeps buildin' like a cup overfillin'
My heart's so rigid I keep it in the frigid and
It hurts so bad that I can't dry my eyes
'Cause they keep on refillin' with the tears that I cry

Nelly Furtado,"Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die

Honestly what will become of me
I don´t like reality
It´s way too clear to me
But really life is daily
We are what we don´t see
We missed everything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end

Traveling I always stop at exits
Wondering if I´ll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies

As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, our good times start and end

Hieres mi corazón

No me puedo explicar
Qué extraía sensación

Tu no me quieres entender
Y me mandas a callar diciéndome
No me debo sorprender
Porque así es la realidad
De nuestro amor

Y yo
No tengo armas para enfrentarte
Pongo mis manos, manos al aire
Solo me importa amarte
En cuerpo y alma como era ayer

Tu que perdiste el control
Te dejaste llevar
Por la inseguridad
Yo que te he visto crecer
Me puedo imaginar
Que todo cambiara

Hoy aunque todo siga igual
Y me mandes a callar diciéndome
Que tienes que dominar

Aha La Mala, yeah

Hay algo que va a suceder, no sé que es
Se desprende toda sensación que no puedo ver
Será que el sol esta brillando distinto a lo acostumbrado
En la mañana, esta mañana

Lo que antes me afectaba ya no me dice tanto
Alguien quien alguna vez ame se ha ido borrando
Será la vida que sé yo
Casualidad pensé en mi voz
Te fui llamando llamando

Seré yo o serás tu
Todo está tan diferente eres tu
Seré yo o serás tu
Todo parece puesto bajo otra luz

No supe que es que llegue a este momento
Donde escucho el tono de tu voz y voy corriendo
Será que estoy enamorándome sin querer
No sé bien no sé bien

El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste
El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste
El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste
El color de mi vida cambio desde que tu llegaste

Nene puedo saltar al vació
Y liberarme de lo que se supone que es mío
Lo miro eternamente en un cono molido
Sin reparar en la lucha que existe más

Bajo otra luz me encuentro
Y es difícil de olvidarme
De que vine y quedarme
Sin temor a enamorarme
Y allegando como semilla que busca calor

Seré yo o serás tu
Todo está tan diferente eres tu
Seré yo o serás tu
Todo parece puesto bajo otra luz

Con la piel de una noche tibia

Aquí al oscuro de esta soledad

De amar en cualquier lugar, sin prisa, sin final
Me tocaba, la piel, los ojos, la cara
La vida me hacía volar, nunca poder olvidar
No estás aquí

Maybe we can burn this town
Maybe I’ll be your vampire
We can figure it out!

Nelly Furtado,"Come on and jump
Jump jump jump jump

When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!

Now now we gon' take it to the roofs
E'rybody with me got they own parachute
Why'ain't scared of heights when you sippin' on Goose
Party all night like I'm flyin' Jet Blue

why'ain't never seen nobody get this loose
Shawty actin' naughty with her body, what it do
Jump to this man, bump to this man, stump to this man
Crump to this man, got another hit man

Hold up, I wanna go up, then wanna throw up
My clique pull up and every bad chick know us
Dance, the boy got us all feelin' high
Master shawty, I'm a astronaut

High rollin' baby like I'm chokin' on pot
Super Bowl blimp Goodyear on top
Could I be a bird? I gotta be fly
Butterfly and spur and I got a couple words

When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!

When the, when the, when the club jumpin' then I gotta be there
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air
Up, up and away, take it off like Nair
NBA ballin', I don't care

Now what do you do when you see you a shawty
And she make it bounce in the room?
Hey girl, come on baby, you's a fine somethin' lady
Can I get on your hot air balloons?

Sky high, still clubbin' like I'm part of the mile high
Ears poppin', Bubbalicious, help me get right
Keep poppin' in position after midnight
Moese, fly chickens up in NY

Jigga what, know the pimp war
Houston, we're gonna jump ship, all aboard
Port of Miami, women they parlay a thor'
Cali is jumpin', hit the switch on the 6-4

When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!

Hablando en alta voz
Hieres mi corazón
Yo, tratando de escuchar
No me puedo explicar
Qué extraía sensación

Tú no me quieres entender
Y me mandas a callar diciéndome
No me debo sorprender
Porque así es la realidad
De nuestro amor

Y yo
No tengo armas para enfrentarte
Pongo mis manos, manos al aire
Solo me importa amarte
En cuerpo y alma como era ayer

Tú que perdiste el control
Te dejaste llevar
Por la inseguridad
Yo que te he visto crecer
Me puedo imaginar
Que todo cambiara

Hoy aunque todo siga igual
Y me mandes a callar diciéndome
Que tienes que dominar
O será el final
Y yo no puedo así

Nelly Furtado,"I'm on the run for my life
It's seems that everything that you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you ever thought you've done your best

When you were under the gun, that's right
I know. I've seen this place before
But it's never been so fun
Never been so fun

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

You know I'm haunted on overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebaneeza
I made them see the ghost

Back from the future donned in Japanese kimonos
Even though the streets show love, try to see me grow
I often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage

But I can't make you love me
This time it's on you
And you can't try to deny, these words when they're true
I'm on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me

Oh no, ay yo, cud get to steppin'
Your tongue is like a weapon
This is cappin' from heaven and yet so are ye's

Since the age of seventeen
I've been taking apart microphones
You've been taking apart men you've blown
With glowing skeleton bones

In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you need a woman's glorious style on diamond to fetus
Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon
When we kissed then you soon on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
",I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman,2009
Nelly Furtado,"Let me hold you
For the last time
It's the last chance to feel again
But you broke me
Now I can't feel anything

When I love you,
It's so untrue
I can't even convince myself
When I'm speaking,
It's the voice of someone else

Whoa it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Oh the truth hurts
And lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before

Oh what are we doing
We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us

Running back through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train when it's too late (too late)

Oh it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Well the truth hurts,
And lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before

But we're running through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train
When we both know it's too late (too late)

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything that your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real

Waiting, alone, would you bring me flowers

You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain't going solo
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no

You liked me 'til you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so low below then why you watching
You say good things come to those who wait
Well I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days
When I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was 
Just to prove I could walk beside you

Now that I've flown away 
I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day 
I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it?s a lot of yearning

Your face, the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what I'm about

It's so much easier to stay down there 
Guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself 
Trying to break through

Than to burn in the spotlight
Turn in the spitfire
Scream without making a sound
Be up here and not looking down 
Because we?re all afraid of heights

Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself

Nelly Furtado,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last",Crocodile Rock,2011
Nelly Furtado,"Mama told me to stay away from them niggas
Mama told me she had a K for them niggas
Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas
But my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas
They just young black and ignorant lusting over models and them Benjamins

Got the game twisted (like what?) licorice
When I was rocking lottos moving packs up on McDonalds
She was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use that still 'cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my papa smoking sure and bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat-tat my four five knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this
Pharrell, drop the instrumental

Yes sir

[Chorus: x2]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from
(From my mama's womb)

Crack a Swisher, crack the fifther 
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Mom's working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days 'cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me

Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, going around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, ""Here hug em ma, one last time""
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

[Chorus]

Put your block down, recognize a king 'cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never, she carried me for nine months so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like, ""How come?""
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a sidekick?

[Chorus]",Mama Knows,2011

Pero es amargo que deseo
Ven y déjame en los labios
Un trozo de tu cielo

Estar contigo ha sido dulce
Pero es del dulce que envenena
Aún así, mézclate en el aire
Y corre por mis venas

Es que ha llegado ya la hora
De parar este sinsentido
Que por más villas de vuelo
Siempre regreso al mismo nido

Y es que sin ti
Lo dulce sabe amargo
Y es que sin ti
Me quedo en la mitad
Si es de día o de noche

Sin ti no sabe a nada, no no

Estar contigo es complicado (ven y acércame esos labios)
Si me preguntas no sé que hago aún a tu lado

Pero es tan aburrido

Contigo todo es inestable
Pero la adrenalina es insuperable
Así que déjate de cuentos
Y haz lo que tu sabes

De darle tregua a esta batalla
Aunque razones hay de sobra
Nadie ha tirado la toalla

Nelly Furtado,"I was on the grind I could hardly find
Time to be with you
You were always there but I never cared
Until you went away
Thinking back to then
What I should have done
To show you my love
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

[Chorus]
Are you gonna be OK?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming about you
Are you gonna be OK?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming

You were always mine then there came a time
You needed to be free
I didn't understand it wasn't in the plans
But I let you be
They say that if they love you and you let them go
They'll fly back one day
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

[Chorus]

You always were so carefree in your way
You never let it get to you that way
And now you are so far
You're so far away
I hope you know what to do
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you

Nelly Furtado,"You’re on the wrong side
Looking at the right side
This is the last light
At the end of the day

You’re on a long flight
Taking your last bite
Of the good life before it goes away

Where’d you go, oh where’d you go my friends, my friends?
You said you would be there till the end, the end
Knock you down you get back up again, again
And when they run after you
You just run from them

Where are all the believers?
Where are they when you need em’?
Where are all of the healers?
Why’d they run away?
Where are all the believers?
Where are all of the healers?
Where are they when you need em to
Get down and pray?

This is the right time
Baby to be mine
And taste the good life
Before it goes away

Knock me down I get back up again, again
And if they run after me
I’ll just run from them

Where are all the believers?
Where are they when you need em’?
Where are all of the healers?
Why’d they run away?
Where are all the believers?

Get your body to look like Hercules

If this is it then baby why aren't I on your shoulder
On your shoulder

In this lifetime
I want you to be mine
'Cause I took a long look at my bucket list
And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and

Try every sport until you score a goal
Follow the path of a butterfly
Go to Ground Zero and do nothing but cry

Nelly Furtado,"The day is getting late
It’s a lot to take
Looking at your face
It hides nothing
Emotions are recycled
I open the window
I don’t know about you
But I’m feeling stifled

Then I get just a glimpse
I see where our love is
Please look into my eyes
Baby you gotta try to

Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Don’t talk in circles

You don’t know what to say
How did we get this way
It’s like we just press play
And run on automatic (it gets so static)
I can barely breathe
You’re filling up with steam
You say it’s about me
But I’m just setting boundaries

Then I see a bright light
I see it’s worth the fight
I know we’ll get it right
Baby our love can shine if you

Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Don’t walk in circles

We’re after the same things
Bursting at the same seams
I cannot carry the whole load here
No I can’t tell you what that means

It’ll be the end of me, end of me, end of me

I met everything with resistance
I pulled the pin out on the grenade
Burned down everything I had made

I put on my armour
Strap on my boots
Look around to see which weapons I’ll choose
I’m going for medals, decoration

Now that I've gotten what I wanted everything's changed

It may look good from the outside
But all I really wanted was a good life
With a memory reel of all the highlights
All I want is to sleep good at night
Look myself in the mirror knowing that I live right
So when I'm six feet in the ground
I'll be singing like

A million dollars in palm
Not a worry in the world, that's everything I want
I'm wishing I was there I feel like it's where I belong
I wanna be able to go pay all the bills for my mom
And make her smile
Pick up my family and take em out
On me
And my over capacitated bank account
Money is all I think about
Of my life it's a highlight
Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life
Look at me now
Look at how I get down
Stubs and Wooten on my feet
I'm the flyest youngin in town
But I'm loosin it
My vision has just become an illusion
And Now my highlife is low again
Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission
And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions
I know it's not the end Well then again it might be
And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me

Like a language that I share with you

Feels so good

You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself at all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, help myself from falling
So I'm waiting for the night

Baby I know it's late
We've got decisions to make
Think of what we could create together
And with you I am never afraid
To play with the highest stakes
Nobody could break my rapture

And I can't help, help myself at all
I can't hold back

And I can't help, help myself from falling
So I'm waiting for the night

I can't control it in the night, night, night
It's when I've got you on my mind, mind, mind
Cuz you're the twinkle in my eye, eye, eye
I've got to get you in my life, life, life
Can't think of nothing worse than being lonely
I think you're the right choice for one and only
We're running out of time so baby hold me
Days go by

You'll have a prize in your hand when you walk away
Let it slip through your fingers and you'll never know
What winning's really like, oh
I stayed there too long, now it's in my soul
And when the thunder rolls, I got nowhere to go
I keep going round on this carousel
Because it spins me so well
And I'll stay with you just a little while
There's so much for us to see and do

But don't mistake this for an adventure in paradise
Just because the rides look so good

Carnival games are so much fun to play, hard to just walk away from
And all you want, a pretty thing but the price you pay is
Always too much, you'll never dry up these tears
Crying from all the years playing carnival games

Do you know which way to look, all the shining lights
And your name on the postcard of your life
And everyone will say that you came to conquer
Yeah, you won the whole race

To fit into a place that feels nice
To do my work and then go home tonight

Nelly Martins,"A insensatez que você fez
Coração mais sem cuidado
Fez chorar de dor
O seu amor
Um amor tão delicado
Ah, porque você foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade
Quem semeia vento, diz a razão
Colhe sempre tempestade
Vai, meu coração pede perdão
Perdão apaixonado
Vai porque quem não
Pede perdão
Não é nunca perdoado",Insensatez,2000

If you want to go and take a ride wit me
We're 3-wheelin in the 4 with the gold d's

If you want to go and get high wit me

Oh why must I feel this way

Lookin' tryin' to spot somethin' real nice
Looking for a lil shorty I noticed
So that I can take home (i can take home)
She can be 18 18 wit a attitude
Or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky thick
Girl you know that its on (you know that its on)
I peep somethin' comin' towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin' she was peepin' and I dig the last video
So when Nelly can we go?
How could I tell her no
Her measurements was 36 25 34 {feel it}
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

We're 3-wheelin in the 4 with the gold d's

Watch the candy-paint change every time I switch lanes",Ride with Me,2007

You're always dreaming' 'bout what you lack.
You're takin' your time from your busy day,
To sit by the track and watch the train roll away.

[Chorus:]
Dreamer I know what you're thinkin',
I can see it in your face.
Maybe before you were happy,
But now your thoughts aren't of this place.

You've begun to change now baby, I don't see.
Oh but I know you well and it's clear to me.
You think chains hold you here now baby, but they don't exist.
You don't have to stay mama, I won't insist.

[Chorus]

So take the train today, and don't look back again.
Live the dreams you have, don't dwell on what has been.
Your future's brighter now, there's brighter days ahead.
Any sad farewell words, better left unsaid.

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Nelson,"Here she comes, just like an angel.
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind,
But nothing has changed;
She thinks I'm a waste of her time.
There she goes; she don't know what she's missing.
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight?
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire.
I'm on the outside lookin' in
Let me into your heart - oh,
There's nothing on Earth that
Should keep us apart.
I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone,
'Cause I can't live without your love.

Nelson,"It might be the way you move that keeps me up at night,
Or the outline of your silhouette when you step into the light.
Is it in the things you say or the message in your eyes?
The urgency you feel from me cannot be denied.
I wanted freedom, not some ball and chain,
But now I feel like giving in,
And I know what's to blame.
It's just desire burning up my heart.
I never want to let this feeling go.
It's just desire
That makes me want to love you
All night long.
I feel like there's a spell on me

It hit me like a ton of bricks,
Right between the eyes.
I swore I'd never take the fall.

Could you be my destiny
Or something I'll regret?

I ain't hungry for no lasting thing.

For your love to come around,
But now the ties are broken;
I'm crashing to the ground.
Can't you see?  My heart's in bits and pieces.
It comes as no surprise, after all your lies.
I was a fool to believe in those empty tears you cried.
How long was it going on?
Could it be you were deceiving me right from the start?
I'll never forget the
Day I came back just to find you in someone

I let the passion blind me when the truth was plain to see.
You made the chains that bind me, and I just can't break free.

It comes as no surprise, after all your lies.
I was a fool to believe in those empty tears you cried.
Oh, can't you see our love's in bits and pieces?

Decided it's impossible to keep you satisfied

When the feelin's gone

Before you take that five o'clock plane, hey, hey",Five O'Clock Plane,1995
Nelson,"(Look up) There`s no man on the moon tonight 
Guess he`s turned his back on me (once again) 
The wicked walls of this dead-end town are closing in and I can`t breathe 
(Sail away) Down the river of shattered dreams; 
My destiny`s disguised (but I will find it) 
Empty promises flow my way, adrift in shame; do you feel the same? 

[Chorus]
Another time, another place we won`t be prisoners of fate 
Somehow, we`ll find a way to get out of here 
Oh, why don`t we make the great escape and set our sites on higher ground? 
We`re taking the ride all the way to the other side 

(Step inside) See the man with the cracked guitar 
Selling tales of sonic gray (the skies are falling) 
No one gathers to sympathize or pay tribute to his fading flame 
Tattoo girl on a butterfly 
Sowing seeds of boundless hope (and devotion) 
Follow me through a leap of faith; I know the way, I heard her say 

[Chorus]
 
I know why you cry 
Just let go; it`s easy if you try 

Another time, another place we won`t be prisoners of fate 
Somehow, we`ll find a way to get out of here 
Oh, why don`t we make the great escape and set our sites on higher ground? 
We`re taking the ride all the way to the other side. Whoa, yeah! 
We`ve got to make the great escape and leave behind what can`t be saved 
We`re taking the ride all the way to the other side 

Don`t look back, don`t look back... 
Come on, come on, come on and take my hand. 
Whoa! Sail away! 
Do you feel the same like I do? 
Don`t look back",The Great Escape,1995
Nelson,"Looking back on a girl I knew 
Whose smile and laughter carried me through 
Oh, the way that I felt when she looked at me that way 

When I heard she was gone I had no one to hold 
I wept as I felt my heart growin' cold 
Like Poppa she taught me there's no time like today 
...I hear her saying 

Chorus: 
Love me today, and let my strength be your own 
Love me today, because tomorrow I'll be gone 
When I feel it's time to go - I'll be on my way 
So love me today 

I remember a time back when 
Poppa would laugh as I held his hand 
And just one embrace would make my troubles pass 

I thought those times would never end 
The day that he left he smiled and he said, 
I'll be home soon but Poppa never came back... 
I hear him saying 

Don't be afraid to say, ""I love you"" 
Take the moment and make it last 
‘Cause if you don't tell them you love them 
You might not get a second chance 
...So hear them saying

....Love me today (Oh)

Nelson,"Your first hello, the darkness is broken 
You're scared, I know, the wheels are in motion 
It's opening night for the show of your lifetime, my friend 
The days roll by, you live for tomorrow 
Against the tide, in an ocean of sorrow 
Well, is it all worth it if nobody wins in the end? 

We learn as a child to carry the pain and hide it away in the dark 
We've all lived this charade, but I don't want to play anymore 

Give me love for the rest of my life 
Give me hope for the rest of my days 
I'm tired of watching the world slip away 
There's one thing you must understand 
When there's no forgiveness then nobody wins in the end 

You've come of age (you're a slave), a slave and a soldier 
You fight the rage (every day), but you heart's growing colder 
You're starting to wonder if nobody wins in the end 
You know, I'd rather die than keep living the lie we've become 

I want to break free! I won't let these fools hold me down! 
I'm gonna spread my wings and fly 

It's time to go, the curtain is falling

Dust off the ashes and take my hand 
I will pull you away from the quick in the sand 
Tonight is the night we reach the promised land

You`re clinging to the past 
Scared to go too far too fast

Now I need some peace on earth
Can you heal my heartache? Can you save my soul?
I'm loking for some peace on earth
I swear once I've found you, I'll never let you go

Through the years, I've walked alone
Guess I've finally reached the end of my road
Faced the fears, felt the rage
Up to now I've lived my life a crying clown inside a cage

But I, I hear you calling out to me

Will you be my peace on earth?
Will you heal my heartache, will you save my soul?

Somebody to love me, to stay by my side

I hear you! Alright! 

So you feel a little jaded? 
Do you find your dreams have all been traded for a grownup point of view? 
Have your memories faded? 
Did you forget how you always swore you`d make it? 
Well, why is life now living you? 

So many days I`d waste away 
Let my dismay consume and bind me 
Now here I stand, a liberated man 
I took command by taking it easy 

They say you ain`t got it, but don`t you believe it 
They pray that you`ll fall in line 
Within your reflection discover perfection 
Don`t fall for the loveless lies 
The one to believe in is right before your eyes 

What they sell, are you buyin`? 
Do I come off like another pitchman lyin`? 
Well, who can you believe? 
You might think you`re dyin`... 
Is what you feel just the child in your heart a-cryin` 
For you to set it free? Oh! 

We`re bought and sold, taught lust for gold 
Trade youth for old schoold blind ambition 
But if you slow it down and take a look around 
You won`t believe what you`ve been missing 

What`s family honor? 
Did you faithfully bow down and allow your father 
To steal your sense of pride? 
Or was it your momma? 
Has she treated you like you`ve been her little trauma 
Since the day the rabbit died? 
I hear you! Oh, yeah!

Won't walk away, walk away from you

Salvation in sleep always seems to escape 
I look down at your picture in pieces thrown across my room 
The future was hidden in the cards we were dealt 
How could you cheat on the love that I felt? 
I sink my head in my pillow, confused about what I'll do about you 

Though I try, I can't decide 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 
Can't you see what you mean to me 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 

I can't see an end to the pain that I'm in 
The alibis you handed me seemed mighty thin 
Clear the lump from my throat, read your letter just one more time 
I haven't been asleep for a week 'cause it seems 
That I can't close my eyes, you're there in my dreams 
I throw your number in the trash, confused about what I'll do about you 

Addicted to your love like a martyr is to pain 
Like a sinner craves a vice and a drug need a vein 
Am I giving you the blade and begging you to run me through? 
Well, I'm the type of man who believes in the fight 
I know what is wrong and I'd die for what's right

Hey, let's start a holy war!

Midnight preacher calls me a sinner 
And maybe he's right 
He said he's just used the hot line 
And God's got a message for me 
He says 
He condemns my situation, if I want to find salvation 
It's time to phone in my donation as a vow of faith 
He tells me that the church has got an image to protect 
And God wants me to give, give 'til it hurts 

Stayed me hand, it's just as well 
They caught him using God's tax-free cash 
To feed the kitty in some cheap motel 
And now he's going to Hell

Nelson,"You led me on and took me in 
Behind the veil but never again 
Will I ever betray myself surrender to a savior`s hell 

For seven years I`d trust in you 
My innocence I gave to you 
You`d turn upon this gentle soul 
Destroy naivety and hope 

The day I found the Judas Mirror 
Shades of gray turned crystal clear and 
I could see for miles and miles 
Your betrayals and my denials 

I swore allegiance to the flag - 
Then bore your judgements on my back 
As sign 'em up and rob 'em blind 
Became modus operandi 

Battered, bleeding, bruised of heart - 
My self-esteem you tore apart 
Then spoke to me with forked tongue 
My game you threw and swore I`d won 

Reflections in the Judas Mirror 
Everything revealed so clearly 
Steal a look at times gone by 
And spitting out my last good-bye 

Well I won`t live in apathy, embittered by the memories 
You haven`t seen the last of me 
Never, I`ll never - pass your way again 

I`m stunned you sleep with you each night - 
An incubating parasite 
When daylight shines through your disguise 
The truth will lead to your demise",The Judas Mirror,1996
Nelson,"You had me right in the palm of your hand
Gave you my soul, I was at your command
You had control,
How, I don't understand but it's over now

Trusted your promises, believed your lies
How you tortured me slowly with your cheap alibis
I can finally let go now that I know what you're all about

So I'll always be glad you'd forget to forgive
When you leave
Make the aftertaste of love
Turned to hate bittersweet memories
I'm begging you please

[Chorus:]
Just kiss me when I cry
A taste of pretty poison to remember you by
Say you love me, then tell me good-bye
Shoot me through the heart
And then kiss me when I cry

You bled me dry with your vicious demands
To steal my soul was a part of your plans
Your only happiness is breaking a man,
But it's over now

Use sex extortion and insatiable greed
How you'd stand there laughing after cutting me deep
You nearly killed me, never fulfilled me,
That's what you're all about

Since my pain is your pleasure
Take me down one last time
In your typical style you could kill me then smile
Hit me with a parting shot, leave me behind

The tears will dry but remember this
I'll never make the same damn mistake

I don't know where the time has gone 
But I really missed your smile it's been too long
I got so much to say that I don't know where to start
Ever since we went our seperate ways 
Been a big hole in my heart.
As I recall it was you that said goodbye
Now you're asking me to give it one more try.
 
Only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
And so my friend I hope you understand 
It's hard to put my trust in you 
'Cause i'm afraid you'll leave me again
I want to believe thatcha fin'ly seen the light 
That you miss my love and you want to make it right
 
But only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
Got no way of knowin' what the future's gonna bring
So I'll just listen to my heart 
Because it's never lied to me and what I left to be
Only time will tell if you're gonna stand beside me 
Through both heaven and hell I want to know if you're behind me 
Only time will tell 
What we have together gonna last forever
Hoo time will tell do you believe in me?
Only time will tell if we're gonna be together woa'

Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side

Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,

that you've a heart that never melts.

pretending that I'm someone else?

this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out

The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.

is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.

Nelson Eddy,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001
Nelson Eddy,"Well, I came down there with my hat caved in
Oh I'll go back home with my pocket full of tin oh doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night, goin' to run all day
I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay.

Well, the Camptown ladies sing this song doodah doodah

Nelson Eddy,"You went away, I let you,
 We broke the ties that bind
 I wanted to forget you 
 And leave the past behind

 Still the magic of the night I met you 
 Seems to stay forever in my mind
 The sky was blue, and high above
 The moon was new, and so was love

 This eager heart of mine was singing 
 ""Lover, where can you be?"" 
 You came at last, love had its day 
 That day is past, you've gone away

 This aching heart of mine is singing
 ""Lover, come back to me"" 
 Remembering every little thing you used to say and do
 I'm so lonely

 Every road I walk along, I've walked along with you
 No wonder I am lonely
 The sky is blue, the night is cold
 The moon is new, but love is old
 And while I'm waiting here, this heart of mine is singing
 ""Lover, come back to me"" 
 And while I'm waiting here, this heart of mine is singing
 ""Lover, come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,2001
Nelson Eddy,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Nelson Eddy,"Once in the dear dead days beyond recall.
When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts love sang an old sweet song
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam
Softly it wove itself into our dream

Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go
Though the heart be weary,
Sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's old sweet song.

Even today we hear love's song of yore
Deep in our hearts it dwells forever more
Footsteps may falter, weary grows our way
Still we can hear it at the close of day
So till the end when life's dim shadows fall
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go

Though the heart be weary,

Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's old sweet song.",Loves Old Sweet Song,2010
Nelson Eddy,"There's a little brown road windin' over the hill
To a little white cot by the sea
There's a little green gate
At whose trellis I wait
While two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

And if ever I'm left in this world all alone
I shall wait for my call patiently
For if Heaven be kind
I shall wait there to find
Those two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me",Smiling' Through,2012

Nelson Eddy,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

Nelson Flaco Padron,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2001

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2001

No amor, no sorriso, na flor
Então sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz
O amor, o sorriso e a flor
Se transformam depressa demais
Quem, no coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder

E, na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou
Pois a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou",Meditacao,2006

No me importa el qué dirán
Ni lo que estarán pensando
Ni lo que van a pensar

Al compás de los demás

Yo sigo mi propio rumbo
Rechazo conformidad
Viviendo muy bien la vida
Sin mirar jamás atrás

Busco la felicidad
Haciendo lo que me gusta
Sin herir a nadie más

Dicen negro está mejor
De cada cosa que hago
Todos tienen su opinión

why no hay forma de aplacarlos
Es mi franca conclusión
Prefiero seguir el paso
Que me dicte el corazón

Conozco mejor que nadie
Lo que me va a hacer feliz
Que en cuestiones de la vida
Ya no soy una aprendiz

Es lo que yo decidí
Disfrutando del momento
Desde el día en que nací

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Que bailando se van las penas
Que agobain el corazón, tú ves

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Si temprano te acuestas
No siempre va a amanecer
Por eso sigue rumbeando de buena fe

Para bien o para mal
Lo que digan ya a mi me de igual

Hay que lástima me da

Tú siempre has sido la alegría de mi vida
Pero ahora siento que cada día estés más distante
Why ante tierra entrar tu corazón de mi alma quiero saber
Si tú al fin tú ya has dejado de amarme

Pero en tu cara de alguien te has enamorado
No tengas pena, nadie se muere de un desengaño
No necesito que te quedes si ya no me quieres

Ti siempre has sido la alegría de mi vida
Pero ahora veo que no te sientes como antes
Tengo que arrancar tu corazón de mi alma

Pero tú tardaras en olvidarme

Recordaras todas mis caricias, cada uno de mis besos
Muchos amores tendrás pero no vas a olvidarme jamás

Pero tú tardaras en olvidarme

Yo ya lo nuestro se acabo
Aunque me cause dolor, aunque me rompa el corazón 

Nunca me veras llorando, no voy a darte la satisfacción 
No hay vuelta atrás no hay solución
No, no por mucho tiempo sueñas con otra 

Otra queme robo la calma, que robo mi corazón
Que me ha clavado en mi alma el dolor 
Puedes rogarme, puedes rogarme
Pero tú tardaras en olvidarme

Tenerte bien cerca de mi

Triste pra quem vive sozinho

Domingo sem ter um carinho

Sei que vai me entender

And Joe I know you're getting anxious to close

Must be drowned or it soon might explode

Nelson Riddle,"Each place I go only the lonely go
Some little small cafè
The songs I know only the lonely know
Each melody recalls a love that used to be
The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as may

That hopeless scheme, only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care
And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new

It well could be the one time

And start to cheer and the cheer start to swell
If you like to taking a bow then you got to know how
To ring the bell

Dreams that dwell in the back of your eyes
They'll materialize if you get up and get out of your shell
You can't depend upon bait for your height and your weight
To ring the bell

There's a grindstone for your nose
There's a treetop for your toes
Don't stay home and decompose
Just get out and get going where a go getter goes

Who can tell if you missed a few meals?
If you're down at the heels put on a well to do smile
And you'll do well
Don't hide your head in a truck just come up, all up
And ring the bell

And it's like I always say
Don't do anything halfway
There's a time for work and play
Don't put off tomorrow what you could do today

Ring the bell [Incomprehensible]
Why it's simply absurd how much a wide awake crook can compel
When it's the time to get up, that's the time to get up

And ring, and ring, and ring the bell

Light up your face with gladness

You'll find that life is still worthwhile

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some they may go for a cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see

But still I love to look in your eyes, oh yeah

My heart does not stand still, just hear it beat
Oh, it's too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes
But still I love to look in your eyes",This Can't Be Love,2005
Nelson Riddle,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,2006
Nelson Riddle,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,2006
Nelson Riddle,"The moon was all aglow
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
You didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who wouldn't believe those eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

The Devil was in your heart
But Heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies
Those lies
Teeny-weeny little white lies",Little White Lies,2006
Nelson Riddle,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I pine, for you dear only
Why haven`t you seen it?
I`m all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it`s me you`re wronging
I tell you I mean it
I`m all for you, body and soul

I can`t believe it, it`s hard to conceive it
That you`d turn away romance.
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending 
Unless I can have
Just one more chance, dear

My life a wreck you`re making
My heart is yours for just the taking
I`ll gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul",Body and Soul,2007
Nelson Riddle,"Listen to my tale of woe
it's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you, so

Oh sweet and lovely
Lady be good
Oh lady be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady be good, to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just 
a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just 
a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me

Oh, lady be good to me","Oh, Lady Be Good",2007
Nelson Riddle,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store? should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two",I Get Along Without You Very Well,2007
Nelson Riddle,"Blow ill wind
Blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good
No good
Go ill wind
Go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that ain't good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame
So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good

So, ill wind, blow away
Please let me rest today
You're blowing me no good, no good, no good",Ill Wind,2007
Nelson Riddle,"What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
But you took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lord up in Heaven above
Just what is this thing called love?",What Is This Thing Called Love?,2007
Nelson Riddle,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air
When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone
What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,2007
Nelson Riddle,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2007
