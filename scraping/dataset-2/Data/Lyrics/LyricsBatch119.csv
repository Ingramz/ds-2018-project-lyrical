David Hahn,"I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you or no one
That's why I'm through with love

I've locked my heart
I keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
Like an icy Frigadere
For I need to care for no one
That's why I'm through with love

Why did you lead me
To think that you cared
You didn't need me
For you have your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion
Emotion
??
By the spring
And all it meant to me
It could never be
The things that used to be
For I must have you or no one
That's why I'm through with love",I'm Thru with Love,2006
David Halley,"If I ever get out of this hole that I'm in
I'll take a stand. I'll be a man of steel.

Too many mistakes, not enough breaks
In my life for one man to stand

I will overcome my fears, and I'll be a strong as I appear.
I'll be a man of steel. I am really REALLY real.



",Man of Steel,1994
David Hallyday,"C'est la nuit dans le quartier des fous
Les matons ont tiré les verrous
Sur des tueurs, des voleurs de cachous
Des flambeurs, des tatoués des loulous

Oui, la liberté, faut la payer
Et on enterre nos corps sous le mirador

Et la liberté, faut la rêver
Quand on promène nos corps sous le mirador

C'est la nuit mais c'est pas le Pérou
Y a des prisons à ciel ouvert partout

Il y a pas d'école pour apprendre à aimer
Il y a des écoles pour apprendre à tuer

Oui, la liberté, faut la payer
Et on enterre nos corps sous le mirador

La liberté, faut la rêver
Quand on promène nos corps sous le mirador

Sûr qu'on a des doutes et des problèmes
Du fond du trou on peut plus dire, je t'aime

La chance ici, s'appelle plus la veine
La veine ici, c'est bien fini, le cœur se bat sans bruit

C'est pas le Pérou mais faut rêver
Quand on promène nos corps sous le mirador

Oui, la liberté, faut la payer
Quand on enterre nos corps sous le mirador

C'est pas le Pérou mais faut rêver
Quand on promène nos corps sous le mirador

Oui, la liberté, faut la payer
Quand on enterre nos corps sous le mirador

Sous le mirador
Sous le mirador

Sous le mirador",Mirador,1993
David Hallyday,"Avant il y a longtemps
Je croyais pouvoir bruler le temps
Voyager dans le moment présent
Sans me souvenir

Pourtant dans ma mémoire
Je dévore le livre de mon histoire
Qui m'enchaîne et me permet de voir
Dans mon avenir

Le temps ne veut rien savoir
Il donne l'espoir et puis il le détruit, le temps
N'efface jamais
Le manque à donner
À recevoir l'amour

Je vois dans la douleur
Le poison s'étaler sur mon cœur
Des regrets qui survivent au erreurs
Coulent dans les larmes

J'entends dans mon naufrage
Un silence dont j'ai oublié l'âge
Je ne sais pas traduire son message
Ni même son nom

Le temps n'efface plus rien
Pas un seule chagrin ne lui resisterait autant
On n'oublie jamais
Le manque à donner

À recevoir tellement d'amour
Tellement d'amour
Le temps s'en fout de nous, de nous
Comme toujours

Adieu , je ne suis pas
Prés à renoncer à d'autres vies
Même si ce que j'aime n'existe pas
Dans ce monde en ruine

Le temps se fout de moi
Il nous tient et il nous sépare
On nous dit non, il n'existe pas
Tout est comme avant tu penses

Le temps n'oublie rien
Les plus beaux chagrins
Infantiles ou bien dérisoires
Le temps n'oublie pas
Les heures et l'endroit dans les ténébres

Le temps se fout bien de nous
Nous fait croire en tout
Pour se donner encore le temps
N'efface jamais
Le manque à donner
À recevoir l'amour

",Le Manque a Donner,1999
David Hallyday,"S'éviter les premiers signes d'usure
C'est mieux comme ça
Les reproches qu'on s' jette à la figure
Et qu'on ne pesne pas

Ne pas vouloir qu'l'amour se fissure
C'est mieux comme ça
Et faire l'impossible pour que ça dure
Ça changerait quoi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

Ne pas succomber aux bleus, aux blessures
C'est mieux comme ça
Enfermer son cœur dans une armure
Ça ressemble à quoi

Trouver des faux-semblants qui rassurent
On vaut mieux qu'ça
Laissons nous une histoire sans rature
Entre toi et moi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

S'eviter des mensonges, les parjures
C'est mieux comme ça
Lorsqu'on ne devient plus qu'une aventure
C'est déjà trop tard

Partir quand on s'aime encore, bien sur
Ça n'se fait pas
Mais souhaitons cette déchirure
Plus belle
Plus belle comme ça

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

",On S'En Va,1999
David Hallyday,"Demain ou après
On ne sera plus là
Pour faire ce qu'il faut faire
Ou n'pas faire

Il sera trop tard
Pour revenir en arrière
C'est maintenant qu'on fait la terre
De nos enfants

Qu'est ce qu'on laisse derrière nous

Si c'est un monde en poussière
Un paradis, un enfer
Qu'on laisse, qu'on délaisse

Une mer, sans dauphin
Des fôrets sans arbres
Un ciel où ne vole rien
Qu'des vautours

Est-ce qu'on dort tranquille
A ne plus rêver d'amour
Peut on vivre
Sans voir plus loin
C'que s'ra demain

Qu'est ce qu'on laisse derrière nous
Si c'est un monde en colère
Un paradis, un enfer
Qu'on laisse

Qu'est ce qu'on fait de nous
De nos mains, de nos prières
Un oasis, un désert
Qu'on laisse, qu'on délaisse

Car demain ou après
On ne sera plus là
Pour revenir en arière
Il sera trop tard

",Un Paradis un Enfer,1999
David Hallyday,"Un petit peu de toi
Pour échapper
A la solitude

Quand tu n'es pas là
Un peu de toi
Pour moins de blessures

Un peu de toi pour réchauffer
Mon regard privé de son soleil
Un peu de toi pour retrouver
Un peu de tes nuits dans mon sommeil

Un peu de ta voix
Pour me guider
Quand je ne vois plus

Un petit peu de toi
Qui m'attendra
Quand je suis perdu

Un peu de toi pour réchauffer
Mon regard privé de son soleil
Un peu de toi pour retrouver
Un peu de tes nuits dans mon sommeil

Un peu de toi pour inventer
Le déluge au milieu du désert

Un peu de toi
Pour éloigner
Le vide absolu

L'amour est la foi
Un peu d'espoir
Traverse les murs

Un peu de toi pour réchauffer
Mon regard privé de son soleil
Un peu de toi pour retrouver
Un peu de tes nuits dans mon sommeil

Un peu de toi pour te garder
Près de moi même quand tu n'es pas là
Un peu de toi pour supporter
Les jours où tu es si loin

",Un Petit Peu de Toi,1999
David Hallyday,"Qu'est ce que tu cherches à me dire
Quand tu pleures seule dans le noir
Quand tu retiens ton sourire
Aussi loin, si loin de moi

Est-ce que tu cherches à connaitre
Ce que je cache au fond de moi
Je pourrais faire disparaitre
Les fantômes d'autrefois qui tournent autour de toi
Les fantômes d'autrefois qui tournent autour de toi

Pour toi, toi que j'ai dans les veines
Pour toi, qui est partout en moi
Pour toi, pour que tu te souviennes
Pour toi

J'ai arraché un bout de rêve
Qui dépassait un peu de toi
J'ai gardé comme une fièvre
Je l'ai attaché à moi en souvenir de toi
Je l'ai attaché à moi en souvenir de toi

Pour toi, toi que j'ai dans les veines
Pour toi, qui est partout en moi
Pour toi, pour que tu te souviennes
Pour toi

J'ai ramassé dans tes rêves
Un petit mot juste pour moi
J'ai volé dans ton sommeil
Quand tu murmures tout bas
Reste auprès de moi

Pour toi, toi que j'ai dans les veines
Pour toi, qui est partout en moi
Pour toi, pour que tu te souviennes
Pour toi

",Pour Toi,1999
David Hallyday,"J'ai regardé sans relâche
La vie derrière les barreaux
La liberté qu""on arrache
Est le pire des maux

C'est vrai, je t'avais promis
Des rêves plus qu'il n'en faut
Il n'y a rien que je nie
Même si j'ai tout faux

A regarder le soleil
J'ai pas vu que tu n'étais plus là
Il ne me reste que le ciel
Pour rêver, pour rêver de toi

On se montre souvent lâche
Pour ne pas tomber de haut
Les sentiments que l'on cache
En dise souvent trop

Saches que tout ce que j'ai dit
C'était pas seulement des mots
Mais les prières et les cris
Restent sans échos

A regarder le soleil
J'ai pas vu que tu n'étais plus là
Il me reste le ciel
Pour rêver, pour rêver de toi

La nuit, le jour, c'est pareil
Je ne vois plus rien, plus rien sans toi
Quand, je cherchais l'essentiel
J'ai oublié que tu étais là

",Rêver de Toi,1999
David Hallyday,"J'reste
Avec mes souvenirs
Ces morceaux du passé
Comme un miroir en éclats de verre
Mais a quoi ça sert
C'que j'voulais dire
Reste sur des pages blanches
Sur lesquelles je peux tirer un trait
C'était juste hier
Tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps
De te dire tout c'que je t'aime
Et tout c'que tu me manques
On devrait toujours dire avant
L'importance que les gens prennent
Tant qu'il est encore temps
Mais tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps
Toi qui m'as tout appris
Et m'as tant donné
C'est dans tes yeux que je grandissais
Et me sentais fier
Pourquoi sans prévenir
Un jour tout s'arrête
Et vous laisse encore plus seul sur terre
Sans savoir quoi faire
Tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps
De dire tout c'que je t'aime
Et tout c'que tu me manques
On devrait toujours dire avant
L'importance que les gens prennent
Tant qu'il est encore temps
Tu n'm'as pas laissé le temps",Tu Ne M'As Pas Laisse le Temps,1999
David Hallyday,"Vouloir chaque jour se reconquérir
Te vouloir sans tricher ni mentir
Pouvoir encore se dire ""je t'aime""
En restant vrai, rester soi même

Mais jamais devenir
Virtuels
On s'ra jamasi comme ça
L'amour n'est pas que dans les rêves
Irréels

T'éloignes pas de moi
L'amour est encore essentiel
Est encore essentiel

S'aimer par dessus tout au présent
Et ne pas laisser passer l'instant
Avoir ces désirs à poursuivre
C'est encore ce qui nous fait vivre

Mais sans jamais devenir
Virtuels
On s'ra jamais comme ça
L'amour n'est pas que dans les rêves
Irréels

",Virtuel,1999
David Hallyday,"Ça fait longtemps que t'es partie
Maintenant
Je t'écoute démonter ma vie
En pleurant
Si j'avais su qu'un matin
Je serai là, sali, jugé, sur un banc
Par l'ombre d'un corps
Que j'ai serré si souvent
Pour un enfant

Tu leur dis que mon métier
C'est du vent
Qu'on ne sait pas ce que je serai
Dans un an
S'ils savaient que pour toi
Avant de tous les chanteurs j'étais le plus grand
Et que c'est pour ça
Que tu voulais un enfant
Devenu grand

Les juges et les lois
Ça m'fait pas peur
C'est mon fils ma bataille
Fallait pas qu'elle s'en aille
Je vais tout casser
Si vous touchez
Au fruit de mes entrailles
Fallait pas qu'elle s'en aille

Bien sûr c'est elle qui l'a porté
Et pourtant
C'est moi qui lui construis sa vie
Lentement
Tout ce qu'elle peut dire sur moi
N'est rien à côté du sourire qu'il me tend
L'absence a des torts
Que rien ne défend
C'est mon enfant

Les juges et les lois
Ça m'fait pas peur
C'est mon fils ma bataille

David Hallyday,"Ce n’est qu’un détail
Quelques petits riens qui planent
Une graine illégale, pousse
Entre nous
C’est comme un mystère
Qui s’incruste sans faire
De bruit
Dans nos cœurs de pierre
D’éboulis
C’est une fleur cannibale sortie
 on n’sait d'où
Une ivresse qui s’installe grandit
Malgré nous
En nous
Une fleur cannibale qui nous
Faite peur
Un jour nouveau
À fleur de peau

Un regard qu’on frôle
Et le cœur s’envole, on plane
Le temps d’une épaule
Et voilà tout
L’amour reprend racine
Sur un champ de ruine
Vainqueur
Mais il porte les épines
Du bonheur
C’est une fleur cannibale sortie
 on n’sait d'où
Une ivresse qui s’installe grandit
Malgré nous
Et, en nous
Une fleur cannibale qui nous fait si peur
Un jour nouveau, à fleur de peau
Un jour nouveau, à fleur de peau

C’est une graine étrange qui prend
N’importe ou
Venue sur les ailes d’un ange
On n’sait d'où
Tout d’un coup
Son parfum nous envahit
Le cœur
Ça suffira pour qu’on oublie
Ses erreurs
Ses rancœurs 
Une fleur cannibale sortie
On n’sait d'où
Une promesse qui s’installe grandit

David Hallyday,"J'ai le sentiment étrange
De n'avoir jamais aimé qu'elle
C'est ici que tout commence

Mes paradis artificiels
Au berceau de l'innocence
Je me ressource à l'essentiel
L'essentiel

Posée comme une évidence
En plein cœur de ma citadelle
Elle joue de mon existence
Je ne suis plus que sentinelle

Un cadeau tombé du ciel
Le présent de l'amour
Je me noie dans ses prunelles
Sans espoir de retour 
J'ai le sentiment étrange
De n'avoir aimé qu'elle

Elle rit comme un jour de chance
Et je me sens pousser des ailes

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

David Hamilton,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

On a May morning right early
I met my love upon the way
Oh, Lord but she was early

[Chorus]
And she sang lilt-a-doodle, lilt-a-doodle, lilt-a-doodle-dee,-
And she hi-di-lan-di-dee, and she hi-di-lan-di-dee and she lan- day

Her boots were black and her stockings white
And her buckles shone like silver
She had a dark and a rolling eye
And her ear-rings tipped her shoulder

[Chorus]

""What age are you my bonny wee lass
What age are you my honey?""
Right modestly she answered me
""I'll be seventeen on Sunday""

[Chorus]

""Where do you live my bonny wee lass
Where do you live my honey?""
""In a wee house up on the top of the hill
And I live there with my mammy""

""If I went to the house on the top of the hill
When the moon was shining clearly
Would you arise and let me in
And your mammy not to hear you?""

[Chorus]

I went to the house on the top of the hill
When the moon was shining clearly
She arose to let me in
But her mammy chanced to hear her

[Chorus]

She caught her by the hair of the head
And down to the room she brought her
And with the butt of a hazel twig
She was the well-beat daughter

[Chorus]

""Will you marry me now my soldier lad
Will you marry me now or never?
Will you marry me now my soldier lad
For you see I'm done forever""

I can't marry you my honey
For I have got a wife at home
And how could I disown her?""

And a gallon in the morning

David Hammond,"I Know My Love
I know my love by his way of walking,
And I know my love by his way of talking
And I know my love by his suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?
Cho: And still she cried:""I love him the best
But a troubled mind, sure, can get no rest.""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?""
There is a dance house in Maradyke
Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

I'll tell me Ma when I go home, 
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb 
But that's all right till I get home
 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast City
She is a-courtin' one, two, three, please won't you tell me who is she?
Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her
They knock on the door, they ring on the bell, say ""Oh my true love are you well?""
Out she comes as white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Oul Johnny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the rovin' eye

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high and the snow come tumblin' from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie and she'll get her own lad bye and bye

Secolo, trasportata in Germania dove Ã¨ diventata un inno protestante, e da qui
Alle congregazioni â??biancheâ?? protestanti degli Stati Uniti del sud. E' stata
Pubblicata per la prima volta come Inno negro in una versione modificata, nei
Primi anni dello scorso secolo. Usata, nella forma attuale, negli anni '40 come
Inno â??sindacaleâ?? dai lavoratori degli Alimentari e del Tabacco del
Sud-Carolina, e successivamente dai lavoratori delle scuole popolari del
Tennessee. E' usata tradizionalmente per chiudere tutti I congressi

Since you'd gone and I was free

I have so little time to spare now
I'm wanted almost everywhere now
I make out like Casanova
Friends are always coming over
Signed my name as if I meant it
Sealed it with a kiss and sent it

When I sit down I cry

And the men who adored you no longer swoon

And live by the light of the kindly moon

But the moon grows old just like us all
And her beautiful years are done
So now she prays through endless days
To take her revenge on the sun

When I was a girl at my daddy's side
Papa, the royal mortician
Revealed to me in secret signs
The mark of the magician

And daddy was no dummy
Did outrageous things with a mummy
And often the stiffs that he would drive
Would look better dead than they did alive

I studied well I learnt the trade
I thought my looks would never fade
If I could find that recipe
To give eternal youth to me

It was always my ambition
To use papa's tuition
And gain some small remission
From the vagaries of time

Every little ray of sunshine robs me of my youth
Who to blame? Who the one? Who to curse?
You know the only on to blame
Would be my enemy the sun

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Supai baby, turn me on
Every wrinkle soon be gone
I could squeeze myself with glee
The promises you made to me

I've really stopped at nothing
Murder, treachery and lying
Whatever it takes to keep my looks
You really can't blame a girl for trying

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Snuff out the light, claim your right
To a world of darkness
Snuff out the light here tonight

Apparitions of eternal darkness
Spiraling in circles through the night
Creatures of beguiling blackness
No more squinting in the light

Bats and owls and coiled sea dragons
Crocodile and carrion beasts
Swirling in the growing darkness
Join us in the coming feast

Spectre wraith and apparition
Spirit demon phantom shade
Salamander serpents, dog-faced devils
Dance and watch the dying sunlight fade

How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.",Amazing Grace,2005

He was staring at his coffee cup,
Trying to get his courage up.
The talk was small when they talked at all,
They both knew what they wanted,
There was no need to talk about it,
They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

Riding the rivers of gentleness
Into the garden of love wi'll flow and watch it grow together
We'll build a castle out of honesty
Fill every room with the harmony
Seeing the world trough each other's eyes
Wi'll live our lives together

To give to you the love you gave to me

And every burden has been lifted
'cause now I know our love will show the way

And, I was looking round at all the usual sights
Suddenly there right in front of my eyes
I saw this girl and I sighed je t'aime

Felt my passion rising as I watched her go by
I speak a little francais so I gave it a try
I was confused - she'd put my mind in a haze
Then I remembered a phrase - je t'aime

Stay with me - mon chérie
Maybe then
You'll say je t'aime
Stay with me - please say oui
To a rendez-vous
Je t'aime - means I love you

Parlez-vous anglais didn't bring no success
And she won't say her name or even write her address
Don't wanna lose her in the champs elysées
Only one thing I can say - je t'aime

Mademoiselle has got to me like no-one before
And I just wanna love her
And then love her some more
Wish that I'd learnt - my lessons better at school
I'm standing here like a fool - je t'aime

Needed a place to hide
I wanted
A fortress

Break through this sheltered heart
Break through this sheltered heart
Oh won't you tear down the walls
I've built all around me
I wanna learn to win
I think I could love again
Break down these walls
Break down this sheltered heart

Been keeping
My distance safe
Behind this guarded wall
Concealing my feelings
Till I couldn't feel at all
And
I closed and locked the door

Someone like you
To break down this sheltered heart

I'm lost in the emptiness
We never share your midnight melody
'cause she's with another man, instead of me

I stand in my room and I look at an empty bed
I need her, I want her; I just can't take it
Oh what I would give, if you could make it
Be alright, song of the night

But I can't get her out of my head
Yes I keep on sayin'

She's yesterday's dreams
I know tomorrow will come
But I'm somewhere lost in between
She's yesterday's love
She's yesterday's dreams
I know tomorrow will come
And she'll live her life without me

She said she was mine
To have and to hold
Forever till death do us part
I gave her my love
She carried my name
But I couldn't carry her heart

So I'll just be holding my pillow tonight
Trying to stay warm in this bed

We can't get back

Full of compromises

See the sun shine
And I won't quit until I know
You're mine

In my arms tonight

Before you needed me
It had to happen sooner or later
You'd get in too deep

You don't have to worry
You don't have to worry at all
And if you should stumble
I'll be there for you after the fall

Just remember to hold on tight
I know it's your life in my hands
Reach out for the one you trust
You've got to be strong
And keep holding on to the lifeline

Take my hand and don't let go again
I'll be around, I won't let you down
On that you can depend

Time and tide won't keep me
Won't keep me away from your side
If I am needed, I'll be there for you

some twenty years ago
I was born a rich man's son
I had everything that money could buy,

I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom
Still the search goes on
I've been looking for freedom
since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found

I headed down the track
my baggage on my back
I left the city far behind
Walking down that road
with my heavy load
trying to find some ease of mind

Father said: ""You'll be sorry, son,
if you leave your home this way
And when you realize
the freedom money buys
You'll come running home someday""

had plenty to lose
travelling across the land
Worked on a farm,
got some muscle in my arms
but still I'm not a self-made man

I'll be searching door to door
And given some time
some day I'm gonna find

Brother and the whole world sang along

Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

It's an illusion that I'm dreaming
Only wishing of what could be
But we can make it really happen
Share my vision, sing with me
Catch a rainbow, and let your love flow
Dream on and on
Let's love each other like sister

Make it better and give them all your love.

Be aware we`re all the same
Let`s come together for a better life - right now.
 
Now it`s time to make changes
That millions are hoping for
There`s a way if we all lend our hands
To the lost and poor.
 
Save the world, save our lives
Stop the fear in children`s eyes
Give your love, heal the need
Save the dreams for you and me.
 
There`s a light to guide the way
If you try to save the world
Make a choice help them with lovin` care.
 
Now it`s time that we have to do
Something to change the world
Stop pretending and let love lights shine -
For peace on earth.

I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on blue bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may on blue bayou
Where you sleep all day
And the catfish play on blue bayou

All those fishin' boats, with their sails a float
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
(Baby)
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy again on blue bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world's mine on blue bayou

The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

David Hasselhoff,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty five sacks of mail

Their out on the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no names
Freightyards full of old grey men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't't no one keepin score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin Â'neath the floor

And the sons of the pullman porters
And the sons of the engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel

And the days are full of restless
And the dreams are full of memories
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles before the day is done

Well, its twilight on the city of New Orleans
Talk about your pocketful of friends
Half way home and we'll be there by mornin'
No tomorrow waitin' round the bend

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles before the day is done

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Driving down the road I get a feeling that I shoulda been home yesterday

On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where they lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

And offers comin' over the phone

And a smile can hide all the pain

The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings

David Hazeltine Trio,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2004

I sing my songs my star shines bright
I stop and smile I take my bow
I leave the stage and then somehow

Backstage I'm lonely, backstage I cry
You've gone away and each night I seem to die a little

Out on that stage I play the star
I'm famous now I've come so far
A famous fool I let love go
I didn't know I'd miss you so

Backstage I'm lonely, backstage I cry
Hating myself since I let you say goodbye

Every night a different room
Every night a different club
And yet I'm lonely all the time
When I sign my autograph
When I hold an interview
Can't get you out of my mind

Come back my love come back to me
I need you now so desperately
What good is fame it's just a game
I'd give it all to be the same

But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke up with you, baby

But I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry
Whoa, I need somebody
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Oh yes

You know my cover, it feel like lead
And my pillow, it feel like stone
But I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue

But I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, baby
Whoa, I need somebody
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Oh yes

Now I live so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money

Ah well, some girls just have to leave in the night

David Hidalgo,"I sat at a table and wrote a good song
About eyes as blue as the sea
Drank down the whisky
And let out a sigh

Children played on the floor near the bar
With toys made of wood and string
Lovers kissed and others laughed
As the band would strum and sing

To escape the heat of the day

Gave roses to an Indian boy
Ran down to tell everyone he knew

At a fountain where mariachis sing
I wonder how long these memories would last
And dream what tomorrow would bring

It was a few days / after her birthday, /

Dull, grey, and long / 'til he came along. /

David Holmes,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in a sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach will burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock

You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal Hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest
From just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to Hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges
At the thought of syringes

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest

You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near human pitch

Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears
To find the key to this cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

Then she came and sat down at my table
As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

With some promise made of gold
That for you my door stays open

By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on some column now that binds us
Or somethin' that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world
Will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I drift in through the market place and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
For hours you're just gentle on my mind

Oh the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might walk for hours
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

You movin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

The shutters creak and Autumn winds
That make me draw inside myself in silence
Cross-legged now I sit and watch
The endless chase of leaves across my garden

And layin' down my hairbrush
I lean backward in my window seat and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away, so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so

I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from working late
'Cause I would know that she'd been sittin' there
And crying over some sad and silly late late show

And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be guess
You could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying
Needlessly in the middle of the day

And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom
And robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home
And she was there and all alone the angels came

Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived
And honey played and love grew up

A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed where honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig

David Houston,"Why will a man go out and cheat what makes temptation so sweet
And it's a shame that neon lights will make a man stay all night
With a girl in a bar down the street
I never meant to be that man but last night I held another's hand
Though her kisses tasted so sweet that's not what made me cheat
So I'll try and explain it if I can
Where where where could I go oh when I needed love you weren't there
And her two open arms offered love sweet and warm where could I go but to her
Please forgive my one mistake and I'd swear it's the last I'll ever make
Let those arms I need the most take me back hold me close

When you're in the business that I'm in the people call it puttin' up a front

I'm sorry that I couldn't be here with you all when my Mama passed away
I was on the road and when they came and told me know it was just too late

I drove by the grave to see her boy that really is a pretty stone
I'm glad that Fred and Jan are here it's better than you being here alone
I know you're gonna ask me who the lady is that's sleepin' in my car

This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river

When our days shall know the number when in death we'll sweetly slumber
When the king commands the spirit to be free
Never more with anguish laidin' we shall reach that lovely aimin'

David Houston,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more

David Humm,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,

David Ippolito,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""

How tempting to caress the blade
Your fingers touch its cutting edge
The first incision is then made

The cruel and unusual punishment
Of her dismissive smile
In her cruelty, her beauty, her indifference
Her gift to beguil

She pulls a poisoned arrow
From her quiver of disdain
She feels no shame as she takes aim
A butterfly pinned to showcase cork
It's just a game
Only a game

She strikes her matchless Garbo
She beckons as she double locks the door
Her sign says ""closed"" on both sides

But all the lonely boys come back for more

She gives the brush off to invisible dust
Fastidious to a fault, shows dirt the door
She is untouchable within her guilded cage
Alone but for cuttle fish to claw

Laiden with gifts
Her suitors fall in line
To suffer the inevitable ""No""
With each rejection and the passing of time

An unwitting portrayal

David J,"They say that there's a broken light for every heart on
Broadway.
They say that life's a game, then they take the board
away.
They give you masks and costumes and an outline of the
story
Then leave you all to improvise their vicious
cabaret...

In no-longer-pretty cities there are fingers in
kitties.
There are warrants, forms, and chitties and a jackboot
on the stair.
Sex and death and human grime, in monochrome for one
thin dime,
But at least the trains all run on time but they don't
go anywhere.
Facing their Responsibilities either on their backs or
on their knees
There are ladies who just simply freeze and dare not
turn away
And the widows that refuse to cry will be dressed in
garter and bow-tie
And be taught to kick their legs up high in this
vicious cabaret.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The ballet on the burning stage.
The documentary see
Upon the fractured screen
The dreadful poem scrwled upon the crumpled page...

There's a policeman with an honest soul that has seen
whose head is on the pole
And he grunts and fills his briar bowl with a feeling
of unease.
But he briskly frisks the torn remains for a
fingerprint or crimson stains
And endevours to ignore the chins that he walks in to
his knees.
while his master in the dark nearby inspects the hands,
with a brutal eye,
That have never brushed a lover's thigh but have

squeezed a nation's throat.
But he hungers in his secret dreams for the harsh
embrace of cruel machines
But his lover is not what she seems and she will not
leave a note.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The Situation Tragedy
Grand Opera slick with soap
Cliffhangers with no hope
The water-colour in the flooded gallery...

There's a girl who'll push but not shove and is
desperate for her father's love
She believes the hand beneath the glove maybe one she
needs to hold.
Though she doubts her hosts moralities she decides she
is more at ease
In the Land Of Doing What You Please than outside in
the cold.
But the backdrop's peel and the sets give way and the
cast gets eaten by the play
There's a murderer at the Matinee, there are dead men
in the aisles
And the patrons and actors too are uncertain if the
show is through
And with side-long looks await their cue but the frozen
mask just smiles.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The torch-song no one ever sings
The curfew chorus line
The comedy divine
The bulging eyes of puppets strangled by their strings

There's thrills and chills and girls galore, sing-songs
and surprises
There's something hear for everyone, (reserve your seat
today)
There's mischief and malarkies but no queers or yids or
darkies

David J,"I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end""

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

And we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring

David Jacques,"She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight

Might as well kiss it all good-bye

That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator

She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear 
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls

Pas surprenant que déjà dans le ventre l’enfant se sentait garoché

C’est devenu un peu trop d’efforts de lui faire faire ses travaux
Un dit tout serait plus simple si y savait quand s’arrêter
C’est encore la vieille crainte que l’enfant soit trop gâté
Comment veux-tu qu’il l’devienne, non y’a pas de saint danger
Quand y voit ses parents s’plaindre pour la garde partagée

Qu’un homme vient lui jaser

Pile sur un « christie » de bonhomme
C’est pas tellement que c’est une grosse job

Pour le voir mettre l’ange au dessus du sapin
Un pied de plus y aurait fait du bien

Nous sautions sur l’occasion 
Pour voir papy en Père Noël
Et nous chantions des chansons

Mais si seulement j’arrive à m’en sortir
Je repeindrai tout l’amour en or
Pour que ce soit toujours aussi fort

Afin de ne pas trop se blesser
On fera une croix sur le passé

Rester pis me faire à croire

Comme l'astronaute dans les airs moi j' porte plus à terre
Au fond je pense tout le temps à toi mais c'est un réflexe
Le travail n'est pas le travail quand t'es dans ma tête
Plus rien ni personne ne pourrait me voler l'amour que j'ai pour toi

REFRAIN

À travers la fête, le boucan et le chahut
De mon premier coup d'oeil c'est toi j'ai aperçu
Envoûté jusqu'au cœur par ton ardeur
Depuis ce jour là tu m’a séduis
Comme dans un conte des milles et une nuit,
Je cueillerai la fleur qui porte ton nom, j’irai dans tous les pays

Une peine d’amour c’est incurable
Pas juste pour ça, t’a oublié ?
Ben voyons donc, tout notre passé
Je te demande pardon 
Je le sais tu dis ça sert à rien de s’excuser
Y suffisait de pas recommencer

Je me rappelle comme si c’était hier
Un peu de parfum sur ma veste
Quand je me suis dit c’est la dernière
Qui me fera verser les larmes qui me restent
Je me suis perdu et retrouvé
Dans l’rôle d’un gars condescendant
T’es tête enflé mon pauvre paumé
Attention tu voles au-dessus des gens

Sans doute que mes amis 
Avait ben trop raison
Je ne l’ai jamais pris
Que je pouvais me tromper
Me tromper (3x)

Pourtant je le sais ben que c’est dans ma tête
Que t’es partie pour de bon
Pis que l’espoir est un sale traître
Qui t’abandonne à tes moutons
Ça me fait quelque chose à faire la nuit
Quand je m’sens p’tit dans mon grand lit
J’ouvre les yeux jusqu’à l’aurore
Pis j’watche le ciel entre les stores

J’arrive même pu à me trouver de position en main
Pour mieux dormir au p’tit matin
Y’a pas longtemps t’étais dans mes bras 
J’passais pour un maudit mardeux

Les guerres de pommes, la cabane rouge

Je nous revois dehors devant la maison
Que mon père a bâti
Défrichant sa part du Lac Samson 
Pour nous construire un nid
L’été se passait dans la cour du dépanneur
Du dépanneur J.J.
Où l’on bravait le bonhomme sept heures
Pour s’échanger un Aki
Pour toutes ces ex qu’on oublie
Pour tout ceux à qui on n’a pas dit au revoir
Qui un jour s’emmène dans ta vie 
Avec les réponses du hasard
Aux fumeux de pot, aux trippeux 
Pour tout ceux qui m’ont payé à boire
J’me « reparke » les fesses sur le bord du feu 
J’use les cordes de ma guitare

David Jordan,"You may be beautiful
We've had a magical time together
Exploring each other's sexual needs
We get along so well
But I think you should know
That I might not be in love with you

When we're together
I love those nights
But when we are apart
I feel the emptiness

But there are times
When I look in your eyes
And I see that I am losing
The whole of my life

Oh, if I'm in love, I'll let you know
If you're the one I'm thinking of
And if you're not the one
Then I'm moving on
'Cause it's not worth hanging on

Ohh, you're insatiable, girl
You know how to pull my strings
You without me is a match
That we can never seem to bring
Ourselves to talk about us I really think
That if could be in love with you

When we see each other it feels so right
But right from the start
You steal my emptiness
But in the heat of the night
When it all feels alright
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Oh, if I'm in love, I'll let you know
If you're the one I'm thinking of
And if you're not the one
Then I'm moving on
'Cause it's worth hanging on

Please, understand
I don't mean to hurt you
But I've gotta grab a hold of my life
And I feel that in my heart
That we're better off apart
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Please, understand
I don't mean to hurt you
But I've gotta grab a hold of my life
And I feel that in my heart
That we're better off apart
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Please, understand
I don't mean to hurt you
But I've gotta grab a hold of my life
And I feel that in my heart
That we're better off apart

David Jordan,"I'm sick of what I'm hearing
I'm sick of that whole sound
I'm sick of that whole vibe that I feel when you come around
I don't like confrontations
They really drag me down
I don't like hiding my feelings cause my head it starts to pound

I'm having trouble fighting demons that surround me
Regain my self control, head back to what I know
Dragging me down I'm still your clown, why do we
Always have to fight
Have to fight

Why can't we just get along
Why does one of us have to cry
Why do we keep breaking our hearts (oh why oh why)
How come we never kiss each other
Just to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
That are torn beneath the tide

We never used to argue
We never used to fight
But now we've thrown ourselves away
And we stay apart all night
What can I do to help you, how can I help myself
How do I rebuild the base of this relationship if there's nothing left

I'm Suffocating from these demons they won't let me be
They came to take control and wipe out all we know
Who gets the blame, we get the blame
Too late to put it all aside, all aside

Why can't we just get along
Why does one of us have to cry
Why do we keep breaking our hearts (oh why oh why)
How come we never kiss each other
Just to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
That are torn beneath the tide

We never consider each other
What we do and how we feel
Because we are stringing out the past won't come again
Why do we play these games and force them
Onto breakdown what we had, just think of what we had

Why can't we just get along
Why does one of us have to cry
Why do we keep breaking our hearts (oh why oh why)
How come we never kiss each other
Just to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
That are torn beneath the tide

We tried and tried but it's all wrong
Baby it's time to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
It's too late to save our broken hearts

David Jordan,"Ego don't ever get you anywhere
But now I know to speak up
Let my voice be known
I won't sit back pretend
My name hasn't been called

As if I'm running from my goal
I'll face the music with my soul
Don't talk to me like I am just a child
I've sold more stories than you've ever told

Don't be fooled
Softest touch but selfish growth
This driving force won't let me go

Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be

Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably

I've learned from teachers

David Kahiapo,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old

David Kamakahi,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2003

David Kernan,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse

Your lips - soft as rain
When we touch, it's fire at midnight
My heart calls out your name
I would walk the darkest highway
Just to know your secret charms
I have dreamed of kissing you softly
As you fall asleep in my arms

I could be there when you need me
Say the word and I'll make my stand
Take away all the fear I'm feeling
Till all that's left is the love of a man

You laugh and I'll laugh with you
When you cry, I'll share your tears

She wonders what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair

""do I look alright?""
And I say ""yes, you look wonderful tonight""

And everyone turns to see

And then she asks me
""do you feel alright?""

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2009

There's no going that
The cul-de-sac one way warned you, babe
With a freight train there's no turning back

You wake to the serial nightmare
Your body's a heartbreakin' sight
A face forlorn in my windscreen
In the moonlight, so blue, so bright

Arcadie is this a portrait of you
Arcadie, you know I do
You know I do

Some hearts seem senselessly haunted
Others calmly defined
In slow mo' I'm watching you movin' beside him
What could you not leave behind

Who poisoned your dreams of a future?
Who hurt you then left you afraid?
Who blew away all your tomorrows like candles
Snuffed in The No Hope Arcade?

Some hearts are brutally blind, Arcadie
Others are achingly kind

Arcadie is this a portrait of you
Arcadie, you know I do
You know I do

But a smile, brings no note of redemption
The lover creeps home to the wife
Burnt out, a silhouette car wreck
Hot-wired in the highway of life

A colt shouldered ghost of innocent lost
Disbelief stares back at you
A long-legged looker, hooking for love
In headlamps so deadly and true

Arcadie is this a portrait of you
Arcadie, you know I do
You know I do

Napalmed with mini bar comforts
They got shipwrecking fem-fem eyes
Capsizing sights, abandoned, drowning
Safe in the warmth of his lies

No there's going this way
No going that
Her naked reflection going down on you
As the white screen fades to black

Oh Arcadie, I've painted this portrait for you

David LaBruyere,"You hand me life to hold on to
Now I've got a lock without a clue
I've got a guitar but I haven't got any blues
You drove your car into the rail
Hey, little star, your engine failed
You lack the luster, dull and pale
But I cannot shine for you

Talk to me - that's what you came to do
But you just stand there without a clue
I've got a guitar but I have no diagnosis for you
Space invader, little quasar
Oh, how I wonder what you are
You can't get where you're going to
Still I cannot take you

I've got a spot out back where I've taken my shovel
I've got a spot out back that's taking all of my time
I've got a plot out back if I should run into trouble

So don't give me anything to hold
You keep your diary in bold
I never said I wanted to
But you just assumed...

I've got a garden where I - am growing patients
And my green thumb has become...has come undone
I've got a garden where I'm - growing impatient
Oh, my green thumb has become... has come undone
I've got a garden where I - am growing patients
Oh, my green thumb has become... has come undone

Just waiting to choke

Why do they care

About me

The world can be everything without me

From my head
I feel so dizzy 
The world is spinning above, my head

David Lahm,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,
David LaMotte,"Eighty-three years and some thirty-year-old
Says that I'm not safe in a car on the road
I remember the first car that came to this town
Oh the changes I have seen
But this bike and this body will still get me there
If I keep them both in good repair
They can't take away my bicycle license
I'll ride 'til my days are through

I'm the Bicycle Man
It's true that you never forget
I'm the Bicycle Man
And my travelling days 
Are not over yet

There isn't much hair for the wind to blow
But no one can say that I'm getting slow
And I'll sing just to hear my voice sound funny
In the gravel parking lot
All the kids on the block like to ride with me
I can skid in the dirt and sometimes pop a wheelie
It's almost dark soon they'll have to go in
But I can ride all night if I want to

I'm the Bicycle Man
It's true that you never forget
I'm the Bicycle Man
And my travelling days 
Are not over yet

Like my wheels on the road as I ride through this town
I rode my bike home from my very first kiss
And here I am again

If you'd rather say what's true

Sometimes all that you can do, is

Hold on, Hold on
Take the dream in your pocket and lock it up safe
Hold on for one more day

When your eyes don't want to open
When all you feel is fear
When you wish someone would notice
And that you could disappear
In the company of silence
If you need someone to hold
Let your tears fall on my shoulder
Let your story rest untold, and

Hold on, Hold on
Take the dream in your pocket and lock it up safe
Hold on for one more day

And nobody knew

With the fire from a church burning down
When the sun comes again the black and white men
Stand and stare at the soot on the ground
They raise up their weapons and summon their strength
And they cut at the wood with their swords
But hey're striking blows against hatred 
'Cause they're hammering nails into boards

I keep thinking I hear the four horsemen
And turning around to see
It's just the pony express again
And they've got a message for me
I've got a lot of hope for the future
I've got a lot of faith things can work out fine
Got a lot of dreams for a better world
Got a lot of work to do if I'm going to make them mine

My town is still mostly divided
And I don't see much color tonight
And I know that it's all complicated
That the issues are not black and white
But how can we come any closer
If I just shake my head where I stand
There can never be any handshakes
Until somebody puts out their hand

Fell into the ocean like the rain

I cannot lie still in the swirling of time
And words will allow me no rest

You stand just past the edge of the light I can see
You speak and I struggle to hear it
I long to explain but I can't find the words

I push through the current and tide
Straining to hear the soft voice in the wind

I bow to the night at the end of the land

We're gasping for breath through our tears
I struggle and spin

Where the water meets the land
They smiled a little nervously 
As the ocean took the sand
They went down below the shoreline
And they hauled it back again
But the heavy rain and the hurricane
And the water's gonna win

The water's gonna win
Bring it all back
It will wash away again
The water's gonna win
Pack it up or pack it in
The water's gonna win

The glass of water you were sipping
As you watched the morning come
Has quenched the thirst of seven others
Underneath a younger sun
We are memories and moments
We are born and born again

The water's gonna win
Ascending and falling and rising up again
The water's gonna win
Ride the tide and ride the wind
The water's gonna win

Haul the rocks and sign the papers
Pour another glass of gin
Cut the ribbon with the scissors
But the water's gonna win

You went down beside the river
Just about a year ago
Gave the ashes to the current 
Saw them swirl into the flow
You still hold it all inside you
You can't stop once you begin
Close your eyes and feel it rising
The water's gonna win

The water's gonna win
You can't hold back the tide
You can't hide from what's within
The water's gonna win
Feel it move beneath your skin

Peu importe les épreuves, faut que ta mère nous approuve
Et je dis stop, faut aussi que ton père m'aime

David Lanz,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life,1993
David Lanz,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella 

Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew

No more sheltering now

Led me to avow

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

David Lanz,"Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita,2011

She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Though we really did try to make it.

And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away

That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory

All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

David Lee Murphy,"A man can't look at a woman too long
Who looks like you without having thoughts
Run through his head and straight past his heart
Well I might not stand a ghost of a chance
You're a one man woman not a one night stand
You're not the kind to let it go that far

And but I wouldn't think twice
If you ever changed your mind

Just once what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once I'd love to know what it's like
And just once before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice

I'm gazing into your big brown eyes
Tonight I'm a little bit hypnotized
What makes a man put himself through this
I can't count the times I've held my breath
As you walked past to control myself
Well I think it's time to get it off my chest

And so what I'd like to say
'Cause if I had my way

Just once what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once I'd love to know what it's like
And just once before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice

Well if you changed your mind
Well I wouldn't think twice

Just once what I wouldn't do

On a lonesome highway it was gettin' late
Not another set of headlights on the interstate
I was miles from nowhere my only friend around
Was a country station fadin' in and out

And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off

I was feelin' kinda desperate as the sun came up
They played ""Hello Darlin'"" and it was breakin' up
The signal on that lighted dial was barely comin' through
And I knew in a few more miles it'd be gone for good

And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off

Be a long ol lonely ride without it
When I can't hear enough
Oh I just turn it up

And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off

David Lee Murphy,"Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
Made homemade wine like nobody I know
Dropped by one Friday night and said, ""Can you help me, Creole?
Got a little girl waitin' on me and I want to treat her right""

I got what you need son, it's sittin down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

She was sittin' in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
She slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
Watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said, ""Now here's something special
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight""

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

You're still with me, and we've made some memories
After all these years, there's one thing I've found
Some say good love, well, it's like a fine wine
It keeps getting better as the days go by

Well there's a rusty ol tin roof overhead
Keeps out the rain at night
A lazy ol dog layin' under the truck
And he's been known to bite
There's a 12 gauge shotgun over the door
So darlin' don't be surprised
If we end up starin' down a double barrel
When we pull up the drive 'cause

Mama 'n them have always lived
Way back up in the hills
Nothin's ever changed 'em
Lord nothin' ever will
If they don't shoot us first they'll ask us in
And treat you just like long lost kin
Honey you're gonna fit right in
With mama 'n them

Better honk the horn just to let 'em know
They don't get much company
And they won't believe this big cadillac
Really belongs to me
If you ain't sure yet just what to expect
From my side of the family
Well you better duck to know it's us
I can't make no guarantees 'cause

Ain't a soul on the ol' dance floor
If you're gonna run with the big dogs hon
You gotta get off the porch

You can sit there all night uptight, honey
But a good time's something I know
You gotta get the jump while the night is young
And there's just one way to go

Out with a bang kickin' up dust
Honey, tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain
Honey, tonight I'm hurricane
Out with a bang

You know some folks say, ""I'll never see heaven
If I don't change the road I'm on""
But me I know just where I'm goin'
I don't have to be told

The say livin' fast just won't last
But that don't bother me
'Cause when it comes my time to go
I won't go easily

Honey, tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain

Well they took me home in the back of a checker cab
After somebody took a chair cross the back of my head
My mama said bring him on in
And when they told her where I'd been she said
Why can't people just get along

Well mama never said a word as she patched my head
I figured she wasn't happy with me gettin' her out of bed
I said mama I hope you ain't mad
She said come on we're going back hey

Why can't people just get along
What a world it would be
If we could all just have fun
'Cause it don't do nobody right
When it comes down to a fight hey
Why can't people just get along

Now when I got trouble ain't no one I'd rather have
Than my mama next to me with a broken bottle in her hand

Starin' out over the mornin' through the steam off his coffee cup
He thinks about a woman whose love he still holds dear
A sweetheart he kept hangin' on for way too many years
It could've been so different with a family and a wife
But he was crossed between his feelings and that Oklahoma sky

[Chorus:]
Another time and in another place
He might have rode with Jesse James
And though he rides, he can't out run his fate
'Cause he was born 100 years too late

It's hard to imagine another world out there
As he lays beside a campfire up in only God knows where
But he feels the day approachin' when the kind of life he's known
Will only be in stories and sung about in songs

And he wouldn't trade one sleepless night beneath the pourin' rain
If he had it all to do over again, he wouldn't change a thing

Puttin' up a fight like they ain't seen since

Said he didn't have to slap me but he did it anyway

No I don't know why

In an ol' pay phone

Aw he don't really need her and I know he's gonna feed her full
Of promises he can't keep
But I'm the one to blame
'Cause I been drivin' her insane
By staying out six nights a week
So buddy check the tires I'll leave the engine runnin'
'Cause I can't waste no more time
I got sixty-three miles of two lane before I even
Cross that Tennessee line
I know my baby needs me and I hope that when she sees me
That she's gonna want to come back home
I let her slip away and that's the price you gotta pay
But I ain't leavin' there alone

I'm bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
Bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home

So buddy take a ten don't worry 'bout the windows
I can see enough to get me by
Forget about the change I don't need the money
She's the only thing on my mind
Aw heads will be a spinnin' when I cross the city limits]
Cause she's been away from me too long
So when the sherriff's askin' if you've seen my car a passin'
You can tell him just where I've gone

I'm bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home

A little white house
On the edge of town
A shady front porch
A few acres of ground
A big brass bed
Big enough for two
Where every night
I'm dreamin' 'bout you

Maybe it's the truth
Maybe it's my imagination
All I know is what my heart's sayin'
About me and you
That you're one in a lifetime honey
Like nothin' I've ever seen
And when I'm lookin' into your eyes 
I could believe anything

Never back up
Never turn round
I was never the kind
For settlin' down
And when I'm in your arms
It's where I wanna be
That little voice
Starts talkin' to me

Maybe it's the truth
Maybe it's my imagination
All I know is what my heart's sayin
About me and you
That you're one in a lifetime honey

Underneath the big blue moon
Everything looks lonely
Even that sweet smile upon your face
Leavin' past tobacco rows
Down that ole dirt road
Can't remember when I felt this way

What did you do
Kentucky girl
You got me wantin' more
Than I wanted to
What did you do
Kentucky girl

I knew we'd have to say goodbye
And here we are together
Takin' one last look before I go
When I saw those big brown eyes
My heart said forever
Never heard it talk like this before

What did you do
Kentucky girl
You got me wantin' more
Than I wanted to
What did you do

Well if I go away
And leave you behind
When I come back someday
Would you still be mine

She called me up last evenin'
She said come on by
When I got there she was leavin'
And I was right on time
She said I'm sorry hon' but I can't stay
I've had a change of plans
When I get home it might be late
I hope you'll understand

She don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do
No she don't try to make me love her
She don't try to make me love her but I do

I'm always bringin' her flowers
And she don't say a word
I tell her how I feel about her
It's like she never heard
I get the feelin' she avoiding me
Oh but just the same
If she ever started spoilin'me
It wouldn't change a thing

I try to remember when we walk in the room
And she takes my hand
That crowds gonna stir
When they take one look at her
And be thinkin I'm a lucky man
And it could be so easy for me to believe
Cause I know there's nobody else
When I look in those eyes
And I see her smile
I've gotta keep telling myself

She's not mine
Lord knows I wish she was
She's not mine and
I'm not the lucky one
Wish I could say
That she was my baby
But she's not mine

Now I understand that a woman like that
Is never easy to keep
Oh there ain't no question
She's no man's possession
Unless she wants to be
So think what you want when she's on my arm
Cause it sure is rough on me
No matter how good feels
Or how it appears to
She don't belong to me

She's not mine
Lord knows I wish she was
She's not mine and
I'm not the lucky one
Wish I could say

Said goodbye in tennessee
I dried her tears and I ran free
Had the whole wide world to see
But that's behind me
Took a while 'til I found
Her sweet love I couldn't live without
Now every time I turn around
That's behind me

Yeah that's behind me
When I close the door
And try to face another night alone
It taps me on the shoulder
Just about the time my eyes begin too close
That's behind me

From the pages of my past
That ole ghost keeps, coming back
No matter where I run no matter how fast
That's behind me
Look for love and see her face
Another town another place
Though I'm a thousand miles away

David Lee Roth,"Well, Mousy Joe got the master plan.
He got a hat full of sugar; folks said, ""You a lucky man.""
One night he just disappeared
And all we found was his hat in a clearing
Down by the Seven Eleven.
Folks cried, someone had died.
But I know Joe didn't go to heaven, no.

He went looking for trouble,
It was in his eyes.
She was a dime a dozen
And they were two of a kind.

Cherry Blue and Mighty Mouse
Kinda quiet dude and sure was 'sposed to be back at the house
With the kids and the dog.
""And tonight we're rocketeers"", said Mouse.
""And I know a little joint upstairs in the back
Where we can sweat it all out and laugh.""
And without a doubt they were out

Looking for trouble,
The real kind.
She was a dime a dozen
And they were two of a kind.

How many times have you said to yourself,
""Hey, I feel like a yo-yo, I've been here too long.""
I bet if you asked them our heroes would say,
""Hey, we're already gone.""

If you decide to take the long walk
My city screams of danger
And you're on borrowed time
It comes from a jealous clock
And you're a permanent stranger
So the last of the wild frontier kings
Is held for further questioning
When nothing's left but death and taxes
The matter of the real fact is
You go through life as someone's doormat
Cause you don't get no sportin' chance
There ain't much distance 'tween a pat on the back
And a kick in the pants

I sleep the sleep of the just after
They said the wild boys go head to head
And like the good book says be quick or dead!
So ante up or let 'em go

It's just a joke and you're the punchline
Yeah, the streets are a million laughs
And if I must, well in, God I trust
Everybody else gotta pay cash

And get a little breakfast
At the local Taco Truck

But I'm on a self improvement kick these days
So what the fuck?
Hey man, there was a line behind me
A line behind me

For a bird's eye view of the play
There ain't a promise that you won't make

Second is, there ain't no other
Tattoos, scars, and missing parts

Is they are to life
What American Bandstand is to the theory of evolution

Is it knowing? Is it knowing?

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

I will be there

David Leonard,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah

David Liebman,"When day is gone and night comes on
Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
Dream dancing with you

Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

David Liebman,"Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That, darling, it's getting me down
So, on your mark, get set

David Liebman,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1988
David Liebman,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1988

Future all planned,
No more clouds in the sky,

Mad for my love,
So long, Jonah goodbye!

David Liebman,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

David Liebman,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

David Liebman,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1992
David Liebman,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1993
David Liebman,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1993
David Liebman,"So can I tell you a little bit about myself
My armour's worn too thin
Don't want to think
I gotta stop for a while

So can she tell him a little bit about herself
Her patience's wearing out but she want him to realise

[Chorus] 
But I fall so hard it makes me cry out..
So, can he tell her a little bit about himself
He doesn't want to hurt, he wants to start again and be ok

So they tell me a little about themselves
A love that lasts a life, the joy she brings him at the end of the day

[Chorus] 

But I fall so hard it makes me cry out",Fall,1994
