Cette nuit j'ai fait un mauvais rêve je m'suis trompé d'adversaire
Mon ami m'a dit ""les fumer pour toi c'est ton cadeau d'anniversaire""
La vie est courte j'aimerais tant revoir toute ma famille dans les cieux
Quand je parle millions d'euros en espèce c'est que j'ai vu de mes yeux
J'les entends rapper, hé, qu'est ce qui dégoutent, on dirait qu'ils ont 400 rrains-té
T'as aucun problème et tu roules en teinté, ton PGP ne t'sert qu'à te faire arreter
Ils croient que si ils n'ont rien fait c'est qu'ils ont tout raté
Tu regardes nos clips, tu nous observes
Quand tu ressers à boire t'écoutes tout ce qu'on dit
Sale petit batard t'es un putain d'acteur, t'arrives même à reproduire le sourire du bandit
On a mangé l'sun, niqué des mères à l'excès, même en maison d'arrêt on a le respect des chefs
Quand j'étais mineur je sortais d'un braco, j't'ai vu sur le trottoir en train de niquer des chèvres
Toujours mis en échec et ça depuis l'école, tu sais la rue les codes, les joueurs à l'école
Des gendarmes et les cops c'est les mêmes qui nous ciblent
Quand ça tire au sil-fu, tu sèmes et tu récoltes

On nous appelle les Rockefeller, gros, on brassait quand t'allais en colo
On nous appelle les Rockefeller, gros, de la rep-dom on ramène la coco
J'suis en 400 chevaux et j'accélère, gros, à mes pieds y a 6 kil' de roro
J'ai pas besoin d'donner l'blaze des potos, si tu savais, j'en ai froid dans le dos, brasser
Twenty-one, twenty-one est le glock pour terrasser
Les démons deviennent dangereux quand ils reviennent du passé
Il y a des blessures que le temps d'une vie ne peut effacer
Oh, tu tireras dessus quand l'ange de la mort viendra t'embrasser

Tu connais l'équipe de la street, sur mon père qu'on liquide des enquêtes te fera payer de suite
Combien de soirées à chercher des sous? Combien enfermé? Combien d'nuits faudra dans la suite?
J'ressors du shtar j'tombe à pic, un trou géant dans la zik
Tu tournes au tier-quar pour un stick, invisibles sont les hommes armés de ma clique
Hé, dorénavant, fiston je n'ai pas le temps, si je sors dehors c'est pour faire des sous
Si j'arrive à 40 ans avec toutes mes dents c'est qu'je suis un loup
On va pas s'méprendre, chacun sa vie, je passerai pas sur leur putain de Karcher
Frère si la zik elle s'éteint y aura toujours du shit de fou et d'la zip pas chère
Ouais, ouais, enculé, des bêtes d'épaules, j'regarde devant, rien ne sert d'reculer
Nique les stars people, ils veulent nous tuer, j'récupere mon coeur quand j'ressors de taule
Un join d'beuh d'belek, un peu d'Jack miel, envoie la prod on va faire du sale
Nous sommes discrets, respectueux mais on a pas ton âge poto faut qu'tu l'saches

Pas chez moi, j'sais qu'ils veulent ma peau, Algérien qui fait du bien
Des ennemis, frère on en a trop, tu sais bien, d'où l'on revient
Apprécié par beaucoup des tiens, le pouvoir que je détiens
J'suis en France, j'vais prendre des millions, mon argent c'est pour les miens

Oh, oh
Foutez-moi la paix
Oh, oh
Oui foutez-moi la paix

J'ai rêvé d'voir le soleil se coucher, sur ma ville
Les menottes, la peur de mama, y'a que ça dans nos vies
L'argent manque dans nos maisons, c'est dur, mon ami
Pleurer n'est pas la saison, 20 mille pour Miami

Oh, oh
Foutez-moi la paix
Oh, oh
Oui foutez-moi la paix

Des perquis', la prison, les malheurs, les dollars
On veut tous réussir
J'pense à tous les dollars
Des enfants, des villas
Une belle femme qui t'aime
T'es dans une limousine
Des diamants, de la foi

Je t'ai pas vu mais j'ai compris
J'en ai pas dormi de la nuit

Lacrim,"Nous sommes les bests il faut pas se méprendre
C'est pas tout l'monde qu'a le pouvoir de vendre
J'suis sur le cul, cette bande de baltringues rêveraient de faire une alliance pour pouvoir me pendre
Hiver été on y etait en effet
Khey combien mentent sur la version des faits?
Si j'dois mourir j'attendrais pas que mon fils me venge j'ai déjà des amis qui l'auront fait
J'ai du charisme, j'roule dans Paris
J'suis calibré où toute zone est à risque
Trafiquinté, on jette des valises, des dépenses enormes on est loin d'l'avarice
T'es passé comme Larusso
Sal petit batard il m'faut toute la ne-zo
Tutto va bene, la mia famiglia vive dentro una casa di lusso
Des morceaux, des morceaux, des morceaux
Mon coeur est dur comme mes dorseaux
Nos enfants seront patrons d'hôtels
Toit panoramique avec Clémenceau
Frère j'ai plus l'temps tu sais comment c'est
Y a encore des rappeurs qui vendent des doses

Pendant la pub on mettra vos doss'
Yeah yeah yeah

Volevo fare i soldi con i dischi
Avevo gli occhi di chi ha visto l'amaro
Stare lontano dai rischi
Che non ti portano molto lontano
I miei mostri più grandi li ho visti
Nei blitz, nei fischi
Volevo diventare grande anche se a vent'anni si è tristi

Shout out a toute la hbousat
Salut San Vittore, salut Afeef

Mamma ti amo, papà je t'aime

Boo boo boo boom, cartouche ma3andouch
Couscous Leflous
Pizza-Kebab, fuck le halouf, yeah
Qui ci sono nato, io frate qui ci sono nato
Tu hai il viso pulito e vuoi avercelo tagliato
Ti vedo affascinato perché
Sei abituato ai Ferrero Rocher
Ma questa strada almeno per me
Ciò che mi ha tolto è più di ciò che ha dato

Hey, j'suis sorti du placard, un tit-pe costaud, j'ai dit au revoir à la graisse
Mais je sais que tes potos ont vu tes ennemis pour leur donner ton adresse
Faut toujours se méfier, à la vue du pécule j'ai choqué le greffier
T'aurais-t-elle sucé en 5 minutes si y'avait pas son cul dans les cuirs du Féfé?
La rue je la connais par cœur, vraiment dans tous les secteurs
Ses misères et ses tords, rien qu'à ses doutes et ses peurs
Chez nous les malfaiteurs, sont dehors à 8 heures
Ils connaissent pas Twitter
Bref, désolé mon poto t'as pas su rimer
Faut porter ses couilles, ne jamais dériver
Lacrim, une putain d'valeur sûre
Ils pourraient vendre sa paire de chaussettes pour 2 balles sur eBay
La rancœur n'attise que des flammes
L'histoire de l'humain qui va traquer la bête
Des mauvaises langues, pires que des femmes
Ces fils de putes, ils font mal à la tête
HLM résident, t'inquiète khey, résistant
J'ressors du schtard, j'fais plus de sous que le Président
Gros, c'matin dans les couloirs de Fresnes
Ce soir sur l'avenue de la Grande Armée
J'pense à mes potos, mes potos en attente d'être lourdement condamnés
On veut voir le monde, le manger, le soulever avec nos 2 mains
Pourquoi j'irais tous les traquer? Maintenant je sais où ils seront demain
Je vivais dans la rue, j'ai dormi tout petit où la misère se ballade
Aujourd'hui j'ai grandi, j'ai une terrasse de fou, la vue sur tout Paname
Oui j'ai du sang sur les mains, des milliers de billets de 100 mais tu sais quoi qu'on dise
Je suis parti de rien et je compte bien laisser des hôtels à mon fils
C'est fini l'adultère, si nos femmes nous attrapent elles vont pas nous griffer
J'veux qu'ma fille soit remplie de fierté de savoir que son père il s'est tant sacrifié
Oui, j'suis l'arabe de cité, forcé d'accumuler les victoires, les défaites
Et je vais tout baiser, tu peux fermer ta gueule, gros
Tu parles de l'Histoire comme si tu l'avais faite

J'suis pas touché, personne ne va nous coucher

Lacrim,"La vie est pleine de surprises, j'ai des yeux dans le dos
Si j'pouvais, j'me ferais tatouer ""DZ"" sur la peau
J'sais d'où je viens, la parole d'un homme vaut plus que 200 000
La valeur du biff, même 2 millions, j'donnerais pas mes amis
J'ai beau chercher, je ne trouve pas le chemin qui mène à ton coeur
Juste un détail qui me troublera, on s'était dit : ""À tout à l'heure""
J'ai le parquet, j'ai des ennemis, des marabouts sur mon dos
Je suis victime de mon succès, y'a qu'au placard qu'j'ai du repos
Le calibre courbe et le canon gros
La bonté du cœur, j'ai que ça en trop
En termes de tueur, je connais les pros
Rien ne sert de regarder les rétros, yeah yeah yeah

Elle sait que j'ai de l'oseille, je sais que t'es bonne
Tu sais que j'en ai crossé, je sais que t'es folle
J'essaie d'oublier le passé, le temps n'efface pas les efforts
Elle sait que j'ai de l'oseille, je sais que t'es bonne

J'ai pris l'premier calibre en main lorsque j'avais 3 ans
Je décale ton string sur un yacht : un verre à la main
Joint dans l'autre, sur la Lune forme un croissant
Et puis ma Patek Nautilus me le confirme
J'suis dans les temps depuis ma mère me lavait le cul
Eh gros, putain de canicule au mitard
Fleury-Mérogis : crois-moi, je l'ai vécu
Oui, c'est en show-case, j'ai l'salaire de Zane
Quartier résidentiel, présidentiels
J'étais pauvre, j'ai ma place au palais
Ceux qu'ont fait la guerre à mes ancêtres ont des enfants qui, maintenant, sont des valets
J'ai pas fait l'école, mais je maîtrise le biff, j'suis un pro de la compta
Tu sors le PGP dans la chicha, fils de pute, tout le monde sait que dedans t'as aucun contact
Tu perds tes profits, je te fais un croquis
Toi t'étais éclaté, moi sur pilotis
Tu sais ma chérie, je te paye du Gucci
N'oublie pas, petit, je volais chez Tati
J'suis pas dans un film, t'auras confirmation quand tu croiseras mon père
J'peux te faire éclater ta mère la pute devant les condés auront pas d'aubaine
On dit qu'avoir beaucoup d'amis, c'est comme pas en avoir
On a des cravates, ils ont des bavoirs
11.43, fallait pas le voir, qu'il allait te rater fallait pas le croire
Te niquer ta mère est très terre-à-terre
Avec compet' nous opérons, nous formons deux paires
Là où tu perds, c'est mon repère
J'prends un bol d'air sur la tombe au grand-père
Okay, tampon Lacrim, formule adéquate
Toute l'année, j'fais des concerts, j'vends de la zipette, rien qu'on m'envoie des boîtes
La philosophie dans les quartiers avant de brasser, c'est de rester vivant
Sur la tête de ma fille, j'vais pas te gracier, millionnaire qui dort sur le divan
J'suis à Monaco dans une bête de suite, cheval 14 centimètres de talon
J'ai les fils de généraux, j'ai le bras long, j'suis le patron
Litrons, Audi Q7 Quatro, n'en fais pas trop
Eh gros, t'es à crocs, Marbe'
J'ai tout cassé, placé, lassé, tassé
Dans la rue, j'suis leur Fidel Castro, ouais gros

Elle sait que j'ai de l'oseille, je sais que t'es bonne
Tu sais que j'en ai crossé, je sais que t'es folle

Au bled je retourne souvent, faut une baraque pour Papa
On s'est vu on s'est plu, j'me rappelle comme si c'était hier
Aujourd'hui on n's'ait plus, on s'est revu on s'est tu

Les armes ont remplacé les fleurs, l’échec a remplacé les peurs

J’ai pas besoin du diable, quand j’étais pauvre

Costa Brava, mojito, con el beber mojito
Des vampires, faudrait penser à mettre de nouveaux rideaux
Eh, j’vois nos vies se dégrader, la valeur de nos gestes est bradée
Des fois t’as beau avoir les clés dans les mains
Mais t’as pas de trésor à cacher
C’est personnel, faut qu’je remplisse le morceau
De bijoux qu’j’ai mis sous mon aile, l’ami j’ai l’seum
À la salle j’fais les dorsaux, la veille j’ai niqué ma bouteille
J’ai traîné mes fesses, bu dans les salons du coin
Capuché je pointe à la tess, on connaît l’adresse
J’suis un homme pour de vrai, j’ai jamais retourné ma veste
Ceux qui m’connaissent le savent, j’suis pas à mon coup d’essai
Mes gosses seront au top, faut bosser jusqu'au décès

J'en ai beaucoup sur la conscience fréro tu sais qu'on est fort
J'ai un putain d'sourire aux lèvres quand tu m'parles de mes torts
La porte était fermée, oui j'suis rentré par la fenêtre
C'est vrai qu'j'voulais t'baiser ta mère on m'a dit ""prends-toi pas la tête""
T'as beau mettre des bandanas, de Tupac t'es la rumeur
Je hais comme un tueur, et j'aime comme un dictateur
Comme à l'époque Yougataga, on voulait tout pakave
La qu'on prends ton cash, mon tapis en Alpaga
On a des problèmes personnels faut pas rentrer dans l'détail
Petit vois pas le pire pour abuser dans tes failles
Et mon moteur fait ""vroum-vroum"" j'roule à Saint-Michel
On a la taule à 600 mille au bled on va nichan
À part si on m'allume mon bébé j'suis dans les temps
J'revois la directrice me dire t'es foutu dans huit ans
J'vois mon père avec des larmes mais pris par la déception
Les fils de généraux qui m'attendent à la réception

Je donne à tout Paname l'ami de quoi tu parles? T'es saoul comme le tarot
J'sais qu'il veulent nous graille, nous graille, nous graille, nous graille
Ils comprennent au carreau
Planter la vago, fuir tous ces barjos, quelques mythos, qui mènent en bateau
Qui nous souhaitent le malheur, voudraient nos valeurs
Qui pour tuer, ou voler ta Féfé', gaffe à ton dos

Sâle batârd tous l'or du monde vaut pas l'sourire de lwalida
L'amour c'est comme la drogue, ça coûte moins cher à Meda
C'est l'Algérie feat le Maroc fuck leur musique c'est d'la carotte
Ce qui fait l'homme c'est pas l'oseille c'est la parole (draaaah)
L'argent propre on le salit, la SACEM part dans des COM
Et pour gratter les remises de peine que ça retourne à l'école
Là j'me fais masser par Nicole, j'fume un zdeh et je picole
Sourire au coin j'en rigole, j'attends patiemment la récolte
Parigot comme M'Ba-ppé, bâtard a des pa-piers
Les condés veulent des photos, poto ils veulent plus mes papiers
Griller comme un RDV devant l'palais des congrès
Avec moi faut pas bégayer mais faut parler que concrèt
Y'a ceux qui guettent et ceux qui butent hein, le gérant qui récolte le butin
Qui ramène ça au boss posé pépère avec sa putain
Yougataga Lacrim t'sais bien qu'on est parti de rien
Avant d'faire d'l'oseille dans l'pe-ra nous on en a fait sur le terrain

Je donne à tout Paname l'ami de quoi tu parles? T'es saoul comme le tarot
J'sais qu'il veulent nous graille, nous graille, nous graille, nous graille
Ils comprennent au carreau
Planter la vago, fuir tous ces barjos, quelques mythos, qui mènent en bateau
Qui nous souhaitent le malheur, voudraient nos valeurs
Qui pour tuer, ou voler ta Féfé', gaffe à ton dos

Cousin, pourrait, t'niquer, ta mère, plata, comme dans, rue de, Palerme
Salaire, Rio, string fe, -sses à l'air, frérot, tôt ou tard, que des galères
Chez nous la haine est une fleur qui pousse, sans qu'on l'arrose
Ma famille me tient à coeur, mon Burberry me tient au carreau
C'est You' toujours aussi paro, big up à ceux derrière les barreaux
Un zdeh, une feuille, une garo, j'suis sur le Kilimandjaro

Je donne à tout Paname l'ami de quoi tu parles? T'es saoul comme le tarot
J'sais qu'il veulent nous graille, nous graille, nous graille, nous graille

On a fait l'platine que d'une main
Les petites putes s'écartent de mon chemin
À table je compte de l'oseille et je bois du vin
J'les regarde entrain de prendre des billets de 20
Porte tes couilles dans la vie
Porte tes couilles dans la vie, porte tes couilles dans la vie
""J'ai des enfants tu sais, laisse moi du temps pour payer frère""
Je m'en bas les couilles t'es pas mon ami
Enfermé pendant des années
Les balafres que ça m'a ramené
Le parquet fait couper tes parlu' pour qu'on reste loin, loin d'nos familles
J'fais la bise à mon gun, j'le respecte parce qu’il fallait
J'nous vois tous dans l'palais plus à traîner l'mal qu'on traînait
Y a des mytho, rebeu, qui se vantent au bigo

Luzifer I'm Paradies
Eine Jungfrau flüstert meinen Namen
In nomine patris, filii et spirituus sancti
Amen
Lass mein Licht noch brennen
Und gib mir deinen Namen
Seid Still
Und lasset mich leben

Nur noch einen Moment
Dann nehmt mich mit

Lasst mich noch einmal fliehen
Ich komme zurück zu euch
Aber niemals zum Teufel

Wer schickt nach mir ?
Ich bin doch nicht blind
Und doch, ich kann nichts mehr sehen
Es ist soweit, habe ich recht ?
Darf ich noch etwas sagen ?
Hört mir noch jemand zu ?
Hat es noch ein Gewicht ?
Wer kann mich jetzt noch spüren ?
Ist es geschehen ?
Ist es vorbei ?
Ist es geschehen ?
",Requiem,1991
Lacrimosa,"Halte jetzt die Fackel
An mein Gesicht
Ein Vogel gleitet ubers Wasser
Doch er sieht mich nicht
Mein Schiff ist langst gesunken
Ich bin am ertrinken
Ich kenne so viele Hilfeschreie
Doch kein Schiff in Sicht
Nur verlorene Stunden
Nur verlorene Tage
Verloren wenn wir sterben
Verloren an was?
Doch ich lebe
Ich lebe immer noch
Ich lebe
Als eine Luge
Und die Liebe
Eine Illusion
Do tanzt I'm Licht der Zeit
Do tanzt in Eitelkeit
Eine leere Flasche
Und ich sterbe vor Durst
Keine Kerze hat mehr Feuer
Doch mein Herz verbrennt
Ich whore den Schrei eines Babies
Luge I'm ersten Atemzug
Asche zu Asche - Staub zu Staub
Der sunde sei vergeben
Blind vor Wut - Blind vor Schmerz
Taub aus Liebe - Stumm vor Angst
Kann ich mich nicht mehr halten
Verliere den Verstand
Ich kenne nicht deine Stimme -
Kann dich ja nicht verstehen
Weiss nicht mal wie do aussiehst -
Habe dich ja nie gesehen
Kann nicht mal zu dir sprechen -
Nicht mal diesen Satz:
Ich liebe Dich!
Ich verfluche die Erinnerung und schicke
Sie weit fort
Sie legt sich in mein Grab und warmt
Fur mich den Sarg
Gemalte Bilder schmeicheln nur
Denn wer malt schon was so Hasslich ist?
",Seele in Not,1991
Lacrimosa,"Ich war auf der Gallerie meines Geistes
Ich hörte die Musik meiner Seele
Ich sah die Löcher meines Herzens
Und trank die Tränen meiner Schmerzen
Ich stand I'm Schatten meines Lebens
Und wartete auf mein Erscheinen
Auf der Strasse meiner Einsamkeit
In den Mauern meiner Angst
Dreh dich um und zeig mir dein Gesicht
Ich seh meinen Schatten in deiner Hand
Ich sehe mein letztes Mal bereitet
Ich spüre mein Blut in deinen Adern
Doch was kommt dann ?
Doch was kommt dann ?
Endlich finde ich die Lust am Leben
Ich möchte dich spüren dich berühren
Doch ich habe Angst
Ich habe Angst
Ich schliesse meine Augen vor dir
Und blicke ins Zwilicht meiner Seele
Ich halte meine Hand aus nach dir
Doch ich berühre nur die Angst in mir
Ganz allein in diesen Hallen
Nur do und ich
Dreh dich um und zeig mir dein Gesicht
Nie sah ich so viele Türen
Nie so viele Wege hinaus
Nie hielt man mich fest
Doch jetzt lieg ich in Ketten
Dreh dich um und zeig mir dein Gesicht
Ich spüre meine Kräfte langsam schwinden
I'm Sturm der Zeit mein Augenlicht verblassen
Als alter Mann richte ich mich auf
Zum letzten Mal halte ich meine Hände aus
Do drehst dich um und zeigst mir dein Gesicht
Doch ich bin zu alt und sehe dich nicht
",Satura,1993
Lacrimosa,"Lieber sterben
Als dies noch einmal zu erleben
Mit feuchten Augen blicke ich zurück
Meine Lippen zittern hilflos überfordert
Zuviel Worte drängen sich gemeinsam durch die Öffnung
Nichts darf mehr hinaus
Ich muss schweigen
Muss den Menschen endlich entfliehen
Ich kenne jede ihrer Lügen
Kenne jeden falschen Atemzug
Der Freund ist viel zu nahe
Er ist ein Mensch und Feind
Das Schild der Freundschaft deckt ihn jahrelang
Dahinter sammelt er die Waffen
Flucht
Mit feuchten Augen sehne ich mich zurück
Erstarre - tiefe Sehnsucht
Schweig stille und erfriere
Der Blick zurück erfasst den Rauch
Die Ruine darunter
Erwartungsvoll gespannt
Die Siluette zu erblicken
Do steigst aus dem Nebel
Zeig mir mehr von dir
Fremde Venus - zeig mir mehr
Lieber sterben
Als dich in vollem Glanz zu sehen
Bereite mich
Ich falle vor dir nieder - Feind
Gib mir mehr von dir
Zieh dich aus
Entblöse deine Seele
An deine Brust will ich mich binden
Auf weissem Marmor mich zur Ruhe legen
Unter deinen Augen mich dir beugen
Unter deinen Schwingen mich dir ganz ergeben
Weisse Göttin oder Mensch ?
Gib mir mehr von dir
Lass mich in deinen Krater sinken
Nimm mich gefangen in deiner Mitte
Erhöre meine Sehnsucht
Lieber sterben
Als dies noch einmal zu erleben

Flach danieder - stumm vor Angst

Und rücksichtslos zertreten
Ich sah die Menschen
Tief beschämt
Verraten und enttäuscht
Und schon früh in ihrem Leben
I'm Todeskampf sich wiegend
Besiegt oder als Sieger
Gestärkt oder zerstört
Am Ende bleibt nur Hass
Und so gehen sie zu Boden
Ich sah die Ruhmessäulen grosser Menschen
Ich hörte selbst noch ihre Worte
Und war gerührt und tief bewegt
Doch zuvor sah ich ihr Ende
Und auch das ihrer Visionen
Ich durchwanderte die Kriege
Sah die Angst und das Verderben
Und ganz gleich ob Krieg - ob Frieden
Egoismus - blinder Hass
War doch immer hier zu gegen
Und ich lief weiter durch die Nacht
Und sah nur mehr noch mehr Tränen
Und noch weiter lief ich fort
Und was ich sah war Dummheit
Menschlicher Neigung entsprechend
Tierisches Verhalten

Und die Nacht der Sonne which
Zeigte sich mir jung und wild
Die grosse Zeit der Griechen
Und die Hoffnung dieser Menschen
Ihr Mut und ihre Kraft
Erfüllte mich auf meinem Weg

In a dream I saw the world beyond, no tongues telling lies
The silence was covering everything inside
In a dream I saw myself, fallen down next to me
Couldn't crawl back inside my body

No laughter on my face, reality mirrored in the deep signs of life
Too long sacrificed my feelings to the ones
Who take all 'till there's nothing in the end

I'm not in my aim, I've gotta love also the other half of me
To reach the Turning point
As only in my dreams I'm my biggest enemy

Till I'd found out that I only loved your half in me
So much time I spent, not knowing myself
Too much love I'd given for everyone but nothing for me
My light was burning 'till the end

Now you showed me that two full halves make a stronger one
Also out of me and I feel the strength
Returning into me I new-found love again

Couldn't have been fighting alone
Thank you for hearing me on time
I bless you for the trust you gave
When I didn't admit being weak

I am close to my aim truly hoping
I won't fail
Before I reach The turning point
Where we're no longer the same

Didn't notice me change
Was not living the days without names
Now I'm here with you
To stay beyond
The turning point
Of my dreams

O found my aim, now I can face myself
Again
I thank you for
Loving me
And keeping us on the right way",The Turning Point,2000
Lacrimosa,"Listen to the silence
Hear your blood running
Search for the truth
Hear the silence
Memories that made you mad
Hear, oh hear inside the fear
How different
Is this burning
Giving everything
And not finding back Make it end
Don´t force to suffer any more
No more empty promises
You go to find the truth for yourself
And accept it!
Make it end
No more degrading excuses
You got to 
Rise your weak wings
If only for a day

I've watched your purple blood running
Tasted the bitter taste of dying ambitions
Then the shadows in your eyes
How could you lose the emotion
Of being alive?
Without hesitation
You stopped existing
Against your own will

Exit and escape
Gather the separated parts
Solve the puzzle and survive
Trust in yourself
You may also be weak 
Shattered emotions
When you watch behind the masks
No wasted words for the trusted ones
When they´d all let you down
Make it end
Don't force to suffer any more
No more empty promises
You go to find the truth for yourself
And accept it!

From the ashes, that fell down to ground

To find understanding
It takes time
You may loose your faith
But don't be afraid
To find the solution

That I wouldn't also try
To carry yours

My optimistic mind - collapsed!

Kein fremdes Lächeln hab' ich mir erhofft

Ihr Zunge versteinert am Fuss des Monuments

A young angel appears before the temple
Her spittle clings under her wings
Fresh blood drops from her brows
He opens his hands and calls for more
I close my eyes and lick her flood of tears
Lazy bodies lie on the steps
Victims of love scorched by the sun
Dry are also my kisses
Which I once gave with love
Spread out on a cliff
Squashed between the cliffs and stretched out
Under burning fragments of my centre
I strew my tears into the glowing fire
Her flowers wither in my hands
Her spittle clots in my mouth
I wrench my body from the flood
The angel throws her wings into the glowing fire
I divest my sins
She opens her pharynx
I lick her wound with my mouth
I have kissed her heart
Loved her flesh on the portal
Her tongue petrified at the foot of the monument
And her ashes strewn under the angels
I just want to live
I have laid on these knees
I call you with this mouth
I beseechingly hold out my hands to you
I pray in the darkness of the night
Crying, I beseeched you with all my strength
Leave her in peace
Let her sleep
Let me pray
Please, I ask you
I just want to live
I want to live

Can you see the tears roll down the street.

And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more

Where no curtains ever hung 
Like a miracle some golden words 
Rolled off of someone's tongue

She got a caramel round round brown
Make me go crazy when she come around
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth
When she got those skinny jeans ridin' down low
She's my favorite candy gotta let her know
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth

Yeah you crossin' out yo label girl you bustin' all night
Not a top notch top rank or top flight
But it ain't a butta finga' or it ain't a Babe Ruth
Got ya dancin' way loose like you off the gray goose
Caramel dumy's on my mind on the frappachino
Betty Crocker dunkin' Hines taste like rios
Her body so frio colder then Alaska
Break me off slow she gone break me off faster
And you know she broke me off from the south to the north
East to the west baby do it so soft
Got me singin' boy yoy boy yoy
She got that goody gum drop oh boy

[chorus]

Less feelin' taste great that's my thang
Honey buns dum dums coconut cream
Cut her up clean 'cause she sweeter than my swisha
I get a cavity every time I get with her
Shes my cover girl lover girl sweet as amaretto
Lookin' some vicious when she do it in stiletto
Hip hop or heavy metal she workin' that jello
And she love to bring it home and help me count my dinero
She kisses for my lady cadaver
Ain't got a square bear gots me a ryder
Put her on the flier betcha club jump off right
Guarantee she gone keep it bumpin' all night

[Chorus]

Your my top notch lady make the club go crazy
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop
Thicka then a snicka with her body off the liquor
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop
If your sexy and you know it and your not afraid to show it
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop
And get your frame off the chain make 'em say main
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop

Lada Kerndl,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2007

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Lada Kerndl,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?

Lada Kerndl,"Thank the Lord I am here at last
Now I found London Town
Never thought I'd live to see

Where's that sky of grey
Where's that foggy day
The gust winds had their say
But now I'm here to tell you

My love went to London
And left me behind
I'm going to London
And I'll find her

Piccadilly Circus
Come meet her
Or I'll rush right up to her
And lovingly I'll greet her

My love went to London
I'm missing her so
I'm going to London
Where my love is

Tomorrow I'll roam around
Old fabulous London Town
I'll search every face I see around me
Until I hold London in my arms

I'll search every face I see around me
Until I hold London in my arms",My Love Went to London,2007
Lada Kerndl,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2007
Lada Kerndl,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it queer?

LaDea,"J'ai jamais crevé de faim, rarement eu le ventre vide, rentre vite
Minuit passée, y a plus que des bourrés et des putains dans le centre-ville
Des petites mineures qui font le trottoirs
Des adultes responsables qui se mêlent au ballet nocturne des alcooliques notoires
La vie nous lapide, j'le ressens à chaque coup de pierre
Rien nous abrite, elle nous fait errer comme des chats de gouttière
Aux quatre coins du globe, ça se bat pour un bout de terre
Les clochards par terre diront même qu'la vie a comme pris un gout de bière
L'humain n'est rien, il n'est rien s'il ne possède pas de biens
Je prie pour les vôtres, dans les vôtres, y a peut-être un des miens
Au milieu des non-dits, c'est nos rêves qu'on brûle
On fonce la tête dans le mur si tout le monde continue à s'regarder le nombril
On se pardonne tout, on se pardonne tout, en fait on n'oublie rien
Y a de l'information partout, en fait, on nous dit rien
J't'apprends rien que tu ne sais pas du haut de mes 23 ans
Plein de sang, tu ne sers à rien si t'as plus la force de mettre un plein d'essence
On a rien fait, les plus grand des voyous sont au gouvernement
Ca va changer, on est toute une bande de mauvais garnements
On fait des erreurs, on s'en rend compte en grandissant
On veut tous des trophées, on croit qu'on devient quelqu'un en les brandissant
On sert à rien, à rien à part à leur filer des votes
Priez pour les miens, dans les miens, y a sûrement un des vôtres
Hier, l'homme était au charbon, sa femme aux fourneaux
Désormais l'homme fait dans la drogue et sa femme fait dans le porno
Et j'gagne pas grand chose à t'raconter tout ça
J'médite juste sur la vie, ses bons côtés et ses côtés tout sales
Le cerveau coincé entre le ciel et ma piaule
Pour faire mon trou, mon crew, mes sous, j'ai plus que ma pelle et ma pioche
Ils nous prennent pour des petits cons, on est nés, on était séniors
J'crois même qu'en chacun de nous y a un Seigneur qui s'ignore
On est tous beaucoup trop sournois, je te le dit cash entre adulte
Prends pas exemple sur nous, entre deux dédicaces on s'insulte
Au lieu d'être acteurs, on est des spectateurs, le cul sur nos chaises
C'est un débat sans fin, d'ailleurs j'étais partie pour un 16
Quand la réalité est dure à accepter, bah t'ironises
On a pas mis fin à la tyranie mais c'n'est que partie remise
Dis-leur qu'on s'lève tôt le matin, chez moi, y a pas de tire-au-flanc
S'ils veulent la guerre, ils auront la guerre, on est prêts à partir au front
J'noircis la feuille chaque soir et des potes qui trouvent ça funky
On s'laisse enfermer dans des cases ou, on fini junky
La semaine on porte nos peines assez lourdement
Dès lundi, on attend samedi pour s'en mettre plein la gueule comme si c'était le jour de l'an
Comprends que c'est à notre défaite qu'on trinque, contents
On monte dans des wagons sans être sûr qu'c'est le bon train qu'on prends
J'ai l'impression que l'espoir s'est jeté du haut d'un H.L.M
Il nous reste quoi s'ils nous laissent croire qu'on est plus rien sans lâcher l'herbe
TF1 enferme les gens comme des rats de laboratoires
Et quand aimer ne suffit plus, on rêve de faire l'amour à trois
Donc je prie pour ceux partis, je prie pour ceux qu'arrivent
Je refuse de croire qu'on a perdu d'avance, mais je crois qu'c'est le tarif
Les jours défilent, certains des nôtres on pris un virage religieux
On fait des mioches, d'autres m'écoutent sans doute accoudés à un nuage
J'sais qu'on vit tous avec nos démons et nos regrets
J'regrette qu'on parte tous avec nos mensonges et nos secrets
Parce que le temps qui passe nous ri au nez pendant que les braves militent
J'regrette de n'avoir pu le figer, ne serait-ce que quatre minutes",4 minutes,2012

Au fond d'elle, elle sait qu'elle vaut de l'or et pas du plaquée
Consciente que les apparences sont souvent trompeuses
Ce qu'elle aura sera toujours trop peu
Mérite une autre place que celle à l'arrière du troupeau
Multiplie les remises en cause seul après une mise en cloque
Mais encore pour sauver les siens elle tafferait dans une maison close
Elle garde son calme même quand ça tourne mal mais écoute ça
Comme Uma Thurman elle rêve de tout éclater à coups d'sabre
Elle a une carapace donc elle n'sent pas les coups
Elle a du vide entre les jambes, ça ne l'empêche pas de s'en battre les couilles
Elle : tout ce qu'ils en diront, en penseront, en parleront
Envoie la balle elle te montre ce qu'elle fait avec un ballon rond
Elle tu risques pas de lui mettre pour quelques centimètres

Elle fait toujours les choses dans le bon ordre

Le pire c'est qu'elle compte bien le rester

Et c'est sans perte de temps qu'elle a choisi son camp
Face au regard des gens il lui faudra du cran parce que ses rêves sont grands
Elle aime se mettre en péril mais bon faut pas s'en faire
Traverser le périple avec ou sans grand frère
Rien dans son survêt' elle conçoit pas la vie sans déconner
Elle maudit toutes ces putes surfaites, leurs seins siliconés
Infréquentable, elle ne plaisante pas
Elle préfère mettre des plats du pied que les pieds dans l'plat
Elle aurait pu passer (?) monter dans beaucoup de trains
Contrait d'accepter que sa vie ne se joue en fait que sur un coup d'reins
Les coups de frein elle se les interdit car elle sait que tout va trop vite
Contre un destin fatal elle peut rien faire mais tout s'improvise
Elle tient le monde en endettant la haine, vit en tendant la main
C'est toujours la tête haute qu'elle rentre dans l'arène
Et rien à foutre de se remplir les poches, elle sait ce qui lui suffit
C'est l'amour de ses proches, son seul type de survie

Continue à rapper comme un gosse de lâche, ils m’prenaient pour une feuille morte
Aujourd’hui ils veulent savoir c’qui s’cache derrière l’écorce de l’arbre

La vie est courte, on gagne du temps chaque fois qu’on perd l’sommeil
Chaque jour je doute, j’ai fait du rap une affaire personnel
J’ai pris ton album, ta carrière, j’ai brisé le tout
Tellement fière qu’ils aimeraient tous me voir pisser debout
J’écris à des heures qui n’existent pas sur votre montre
Je sais pas où j’vais, je sais que je viens d’un autre monde
Personne porte tes cicatrices, tes entailles et tes peines
Et je cherche comment m’tailler d’ici sans m’tailler les veines

Entre le rap qui pue la merde et le rap qui pue l’urine
J’rêve de leur niquer leurs mères, hier j’voulais des featurings
J’essaie d’suivre mon chemin mais la haine finit me dérouter
J’prends soin des miens mais ceux que j’aime finissent par m’dégoûter
Et tous ces tarés se la pètent pour être crédibles
J’vais leur, j’vais leur cabrer, cabrer sur la crête en vélib
J’crache ma haine donc ce morceau je l’appellerai p’tit molard
Ils veulent que j’reste moi-même mais tu veux que j’devienne qui connard?
On se reverra pas avant un bail, vas-y prends des photos
Ils ont gérés quelques bailles, ils se croient dans Grand Theft Auto
Fais quelque chose de ta vie au lieu de pousser la fonte
J’suis fière de c’que j’suis, une bonne patte des MC's me font honte
Pour me maîtriser, appelez les docteurs et puis les psy
Éteignez les projecteurs, ça sent la crise d’épilepsie
Parce qu’on est sûr de rien, j’nage en plein doute
La tête dans les étoiles, j’traîne entre celle du berger et la grande ours

La vie est courte, on gagne du temps chaque fois qu’on perd l’sommeil
Chaque jour je doute, j’ai fait du rap une affaire personnel

Je sais pas où j’vais, je sais que je viens d’un autre monde
Personne porte tes cicatrices, tes entailles et tes peines
Et je cherche comment m’tailler d’ici sans m’tailler les veines

Trop de MCs veulent briller, cherchent de jeunes proies
J’crois qu’tu fais vibrer plus personne à part ta manette Playstation 3
Gauche, droite, j’fais des clefs d’mic’, j’froisse des cervicales
Qui aime les attentats lyricals sera servi cash
Ils ont menti quand ils ont dit que l’monde est à nous
J’me suis perdue entre un ego trip et des chansons d’amour
J’suis pas là pour être célèbre, j’te le dis de vive voix
On est tous un peu proxénètes si la vie n’est qu’une fille de joie

LaDea,"Envie de partir, s'évader, sans penser à ceux que je laisse
Muselée, trop de regret quand j'pense à ma jeunesse
Je le vois dans le regard de mes potes, tout a changé
C'est comme si on avait tous raté le coche, J'ressens le danger
J'aimerai tout changer en un claquement de doigt, mais rien n'y fera
J'veux ma place au paradis, mais lequel des nôtres y sera?
Pas de rond qui rentre, les moments de joie sont très rares
J'reste conquérante quand la vie s'prend pour une pute de la Jonquera
J'ai besoin d'air, pas des gens, faut qu'je fasse mes bagages
Le temps c'est d'l'argent et dehors ça pue le braquage
J'veux pas connaître le remord, ne plus dégoûter mes proches
J'aurai du reconnaître mes tords et plus écouter mes profs
Y a trop d'acteurs, ils veulent tous le rôle de Tony
Les genoux à terre, la vie prend souvent une drôle de tournure
Quand j'étais jeune, je voulais croquer la terre, mais je casse même pas la croûte
J'voulais laisser une trace, mais faut que je trace ma route

J'aimerais partir loin de vos clichés
Etre quelqu'un de bien, mais pour gagner faut tricher
J'aimerais partir loin de vos clichés
Devenir quelqu'un de bien, mais pour gagner faut tricher

Tout se terni, j'ai peur qu'mes rêves me fassent du tort
J'n'ai pas le permis donc j'n'ai droit qu'à la place du mort
Où sont les clés du bonheur ? Faudra se lever d'bonne heure
Pour m'voir un jour mettre mon bulletin dans l'urne pour une bande de connards
La rage au bide, j'me demande pourquoi j'me retiens
J'ai tellement chanté dans le vide qu'l'écho d'ma voix me reviens
En manque de thune, faut qu'on s'lance dans de vraies plantations
J'ai le feu au cul et c'est le bordel dans mes fréquentations
Si tout ça n'est qu'un film, vous vous êtes gouré d'acteurs
Espoir infime, on sort du taf avec l'envie d'se bourrer la gueule
On s'bat contre nous-même, tel des idiots en duel
J'crache ma peine, il m'faut un forfait studio dans ma mutuelle
Il m'manque tellement de choses pour pouvoir vivre sans gênes
En attendant la vie en rose, j'passe mes nerfs sur les gens qu'j'aime
Il faut qu'j'm'en aille, mais j'ai pas mon visa
Comment être quelqu'un de bien quand l'reste du monde est bizarre?

J'aimerais partir loin de vos clichés
Etre quelqu'un de bien, mais pour gagner faut tricher
J'aimerais partir loin de vos clichés
Devenir quelqu'un de bien, mais pour gagner faut tricher

Et j'aurais tout fait pour n'pas perdre le nord
Maman, j'aurai aimé transformer ce que tu touches en or
Mais j'ai pas le pouvoir, pas de super-héros
En attendant le soir, j'me lève pour faire rentrer les ronds
Des fois j'ai peur qu'ils te racontent la vie qu'ta fille mène
Dehors l'orage gronde et là où j'traîne, y a rarement de happy-end
Mais qu'est-ce que j'peux y faire?
Dites-moi, qu'est-ce que j'peux y faire?
On meurt a petit feu que Dieu protège petite sœur, petit frère
La vie est courte et cruelle, alors j'donne tout au rap
Des fois j'me dit qu'j'aurai dû être moins bête et aller jusqu'au bac
On s'doit d'faire vite, les derniers n'auront rien
Dans nos tête ça s'précipite, les regrets n'y feront rien
Chacun s'bat pour les siens, c'est pot de terre contre pot de fer
Dans cette vie de chien, tu peux caner pour avoir trop de flair
J'aimerai partir loin, sans en être obligée
Devenir quelqu'un de bien, mais pour gagner faut tricher

LaDea,"Quatre milliard de Chinois
Et moi et moi et moi
Souvent j'y pense et puis j'oublie

Faudrait que je perde cette habitude de ne parler que sur des pianos tristes
Je rappe, je parle, je braille je rappe comme on parle au Christ
Souvent je voyage à bord de ""Joint Dead Airlines""
Et je me sens bien dans mes pompes
Des chinois se font ma paires d'Air Max
Y a pas de chefs d'Etat qui n'est pas triché
J'écris à des heures ou Laurent Ruquier n'est pas couché
Et tout tout ça parait triste ouais
L'amour c'est, l'amour c'est juste un coeur dessiné par une roumaine sur ton pare-brise
Le monde n'est que tromperie et tout ce qui s'en suit
Les hommes c'est comme la plomberie un jour ou l'autre ça fuit
T'as la tête pleine fait le vide quand t'as peur
Chez moi tu parles mal à ta mère tu prends une gifle dans ta gueule
Ou tu gagnes ta vie ou tu perds ton temps
Pour cela qu'ici nos petits problèmes nous paraissent tellement grands
Fais un gosse marie toi un coup de brosse maquille toi
Mais fais pas la chienne tu vas tomber sur un os on paris quoi
Et non ton mec ne fais pas de foot il est partit niquer
La vie c'est long c'est dure comme un zboub de Martiniquais
Et vu le thème j'suis partis pour être vulgaire tout le long
Me laissez pas seule avec un cutter je vais me faire mal pour de bon

Et ouais je suis toute fière
Toute fière d'arriver à vous faire kiffer sur des putains de rythmes entraînants
Mais je suis née poussière je redeviendrais poussière
J’espère juste ne pas être payée chez des gens entre temps

Entre temps j'attends pas de grands sauveurs
Est ce que vous me recevez
Maman ira chercher ses petits enfant au volant d'un Range Rover
La vie est une leçon
Ouais c'est vrai
D'ailleurs j'apprend le pardon à chaque fois que vous me décevez
Et je vends ma rime comme une drogue
J'liquide ma came
J'écris des titres pour maquiller toutes mes idées macabres
Mes potes s'amusent que si la Vodka et la pute est Russe
Et je peux sauver toute une mille-fa une quette-pla dans l'utérus
Le temps nous prends des choses et les choses prennent du temps
Tu sais
Y a plus rien de rose on s’étonne même plus de voir du sang pisser
Si un jour on m'enferme ce ne sera pas pour délit mineur
La vie te plaque à terre quant elle se prend pour Teddy Riner
Le monde est tellement grand et je me sens si petite
A pisser des lyrics qui font mal je vais crever d' une Cystite
Et je me sens coincé
Coincée comme c'est pas permis

Beaucoup de MC manquent pas d'air, l'air est irrespirable
Tellement de pleureuses dans le rap c'est des Kleenex qui râlent
Ou j'porte la culotte ou j'prends un mari macho
Ou j'mise sur ma jugeote ou j'la joue Carrie Bradshaw
Ceux à qui j'dois la vie prennent mon rap comme un cri d'douleur
J'suis pas la star d'ma vie, j'laisse ça aux p'tits joueurs
Des millions d'prises, des rappeurs avec l'envie d'être friqués
Des maisons d'disques, des managers, moi j'voulais juste kicker
On s'est fait p'tit à p'tit, on a les mains plein d'encre
Et pour qu'on soit des p'tits, faudrait qu'tu sois un grand
Mais tu t'fous la honte avec tes lyrics en bois

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

La dama perfecta, toda una belleza, ella es mi inspiración
Somos feliz ella y yo (ella y yo)

Solos nos vemos a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño, ser su protector
Somos su marido, ella y yo

No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Oye mi pana lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón

Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada no 
Te alejes por temor, no lo hagas Don, oh no no no

Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacia una invitación
A solo hacer el amor

Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer,
Y ya el marido entiende que perdió su hembra ahora es tu mujer, 
No pueden ganar los tres

Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer,
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender,
Pues tu también llegaste a ese lugar,
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer

Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer

Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez 
Ya que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía 
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga
Me mintió, tu y ella en una cama, haya en Bayamo
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuantos hoteles ensucio,
Tu también, los odio a los dos

Me mata el dolor

Rollin' down Crenshaw Boulevard
Starin' at these suckers who claim to be hard
Daz Dillinger and the Gang
Who can blast and gangbang

Who gives it up for every hooker rat and hood slut
All in the cut Dat Nigga Daz with the pimp strut
You slept game on those who act lame
See ain't a damn thing changed
You know I ride the neighborhood slow
Floss on you and let the wind blow
True indeed I'm havin' a ball
Pick up the phone and give my homies a call
What's up with y'all? (What's up y'all?)
Livin' in the city where we born to ball
Rolled up a Philly we pack it tight
What a pity what a sight
And hella Chronic all damn night
Got the weed it got me kinda feelin' so high
Hennessy got a brother so feelin' so high
Pull outta state enjoy my day and I love to burn rubber
Pump up the jam for the summer
Gimme Eureka Snoop got the Hummer
Kinda make you wanna sit back and wonder

The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
And nigga get shot oh who they thought you was
The home of the cities of the gangsters and bud
Or you can get bad oh who they thought you was

Ooh damn back by a popular demand
Daz Dillinger back in effect homey once again
The question is why y'all got a problem with me gettin' high
Say the wrong thing get right
Prepare in effect homies are prepared everywhere
Causin' ruckus all bein' fair
Daz Dillinger finally alone in my zone
Be by myself in a place that I call home
Check it out peep out the scenery
Ya meanin' to me nuthin' to me ya keep frontin' to me
I hit you up Dogg Pound all come around
Lay 'em all down homies be frontin' for they town
Throw it up Eastside Westside bumpin'
California's the state where we be dumpin' what!

Here I am stompin' down choppin' down yo compound
Knockin' all y'all out thirty seconds in the first round
Who come around get destroyed off contact
Realize and understand homey you don't want that
Check it out let's engage in military actin'
Women dope and drama keep me yackin'
Bump all that bullsh(it) you yappin'
Them beats and that bullsh you yappin'
I'm about all busy boggin' and cappin'
Pistol packin' you don't really want none of this action
Homey, you betta watch out 'cause nothin' can save ya
Tattooein' y'all with razors
Blazen that it didn't penetrate him but I grazed him
Now they callin' Daz unusual playa hater
Back on the spot feelin' high
Watchin' as the cops pass by
Smokin' fire homey I ain't lyin'
Who the man from Long Beach, California to Japan
Rockin' like wonder MC homey without a band in hand
A why can't control the whole scene
Watch it unfold get scold get blown away
Any other rapper pay dearly severely y'all come and hear me
Damn you get bruised battered & slammed

Lady & Bird,"At first I wondered why they only speak to each other
It took me some time to understand
That they cannot see or hear any of the crowd
After observing their childlike behaviour I understood
They were two little children stuck in the bodies of grown ups

To the girl I said: ""You are lady,""
To the boy I said: ""You are a bird, but you cannot fly,""

They knew about the presence of other people
They knew about the sun
And at some point right before the break of day
They could see me,
Not knowing that I come from the outside

On the seventh day she looked up at me
And said: ""I am lady,""
And the boy said: ""I am bird, but I cannot fly,""

You are a bird",Shepard's Song,2004

No one to blame
Right now up and about
A minute of fame

I've been staying alive
So many days
No fear, happy or wise
All through the way

But I thought there was something
In life to live for

But if you hear me fall
If you hear me fall
If you see me walk upon a bridge
Then don't recall

But if you hear me fall
If you hear me fall
If you see me walk upon a bridge
You've seen it all

Right here coming to life
Nothing to blame
I've been up and about under the rain
But I thought there was something in life to live for
Yes I thought you were something in life to live for

Why she's given half her life
To people she hates now

When answering the phone
What country shall I say is calling
From across the world

That she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska

Between worlds so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

That she wants to know
Why is it though she's the door
She can't be the room

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

that suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

the game of life is hard to play
I'm going to lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say

suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grow stronger, watch it grin

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
""is it to be or not to be?""
And I replied: ""oh, why ask me?""

Sweetheart, what's your hurry?

Lady Antebellum,"I remember riding shotgun in daddy's Chevrolet,
We'd crank up the pioneers, and we'd sing away,
Sometimes he'd let me take the wheel and we'd drive through town,
Couldn't wait to hear my favorite songs coming back around (back around),

And the radio played, old flame, I'll still be loving you,
I was country when country wasn't cool, forever and ever amen,
Always on my mind again and again, swinging and smoking mountain rain,
He stopped loving her today.
We laughed, we cried the 80's way,
And the radio played

Bobby was the first boy that I ever kissed,
I can still taste the root beer on his lips,
We turned up the stereo from that bedroom,
Climbed through the window and make out on the roof,

And the radio played, don't rock the jukebox and we danced
Strawberry wine, a brand new man, love without end amen,
Time marches on, again and again, meet in the middle and the maze,
Does he love you? Independence day, we laughed we cried the 90's way,

What hurts the most, before he cheats

It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
Caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
We don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find

I could tell from the crack in her voice
The static, the noise
It's leaving on the nine
But when it comes to you
I'll do whatever I gotta do

I'm looking out from my window seat
Halfway back, aisle twenty three
Man I wish that I could fly this thing
Give a little more gas, a little more speed

This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough

I've got my head in the clouds, thinking about
Second that the wheels touch down
And my feet hit the ground, I run to your house
I knock on the door, kiss you right on the mouth

Slide in the middle or climb in the back

Street lights glowing,
Slow rollin' this town with you

I can already hear you singing
I can already see your smile
Route forty-four leanin' on the door
Kick back cruisin' down Dinah Shore,
Right passed the Dollar General
Down to the end of the strip
Make a ""U""-ey, hang a lou-ie
Feel that automatic shift

Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time

‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more

I’ll let him down easy

You swore we'd make it home
It's a little fuzzy 'cause
I was caught up in your eyes Your touch
The rush
When you showed up late on New Year's Eve
And you tried to hold my hand
You told me that you'd met someone
And I said I understand
It's hard not to fall apart
With a midnight broken heart
So I cried
But that was the last time

'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
'Cause I'm bulletproof
Oh, I bet you think I do
No, I don't think about you, you, you

The place where I first saw your face
And you bought me a drink
And when we talked 'til two AM About every single dream
Well now it's just a bar
And a beat up parking lot, I see
Yeah, that's all it is to me

Lady Antebellum,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

I tell you I mean it

Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I focused to spit it right, my songs are an offerin'

Knowledge first, over beats, producers are samplin'
Myself and creations, on the line as I offer in
It's kinda sad that the toxins are smotherin'
Youth in the hood, poisoned by instant messages

Materialism, barbarianism, all types of isms
And schisms by tainted vision
I watched you grow from a seed into a forest
I watered you and watered you but your flowers are dyin'

I admit I used you, but together
We have family, my album's in your name
I'm loving your music beautifully, I feel you slippin' away

Come here girl, uh-uh, can't have my love gone
It's like En Vogue, I guess I gotta 'Hold On'
I wanna drop it for the cause, I know you righteous
Spit something from the heart, help clean up the virus
Decapitate ferocious, peg leg rap pirates

They only flowing now, 'cause the dough flowing now
Who, what, when, why, where and how
I'm sorry baby, that you've been used and abused
And served like hell, some they say I'm a tattle tale
If that when I see wrong done to you, you know I got to tell
Tell, tell, tell, tell

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

Might never be cross or try to be boss,

Lady Forte,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Lady Forte,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lola,2004

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Lady Gaga,"Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom,
With tissues and when,
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl,
Loving me is like chewing on pearls

You've got me wandering why I
I like it rough I,

Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough.

I'm shiny and I know it,
Don't know why you wanna blow it,
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough.

Is it because you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Yes it's rough.

Lady Gaga,"Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me, before it began
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Wont sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers

Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your range rover heart?
I've heard it before
Yeah, the dinners were nice
Till your diamond words melted into some ice

You should been rapping to the beat of my song Mr. California,
Paper gangsta and I'm lookin' for love, not an
Not an empty page full of stuff that means nothing but
You've been played

'Cause I do not accept any less

Rollin' up to the club on the weekend

Fantasize I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up put your hands on my waist pull the fader

Put your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch it back and forth, back and forth uh huh

Put your hands on my waist pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor

Enter that cash flow, I'm like baby you don't trip

So Shawty say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line and I suppose to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so star struck, the gal all stuck
I should have had an overdose too many starbucks

Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Notice who let the top back on the chevy impala
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars

But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagga, they go the dagga
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

But if I do then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit 

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just thrust that dick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame
Are you in the game, Dans le lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame
Are you in the game, Dans le lovegame

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
Now I want it bad, want it bad
A lovegame, a lovegame
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just thrust that dick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (huh)

I can't believe what you said to me
Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
Baby you gave up, you gave up

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I'll never love again

Could I give it all up for you?

Won't even sing along

Lady Gaga,"I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune, or a scale, I could play

The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea,
The silence was too deafening

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
Just me surviving alone

[Chorus]
Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

Everything was the same
One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
'Til I stopped over thinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
Just me surviving alone

[Chorus]

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

Trading the world for money, stars, and power, living my life at 100 miles an hour.

Tired of being in the back now we're center
We're chosen but they're telling us we're selling out
All we wanna do is open doors man hear me out
Were frozen cause they left us in the cold
Only right I took my chance now I'm bringing it home

This is my chance to release it
Be brave for you you'll see
I can be

When you run dry I'll flood your pain

Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls
And  I definitely won't dish out dirt, with the rest of those girls (Thank-you)

(Something), something about lonely nights 
And my lipstick on your face 
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy 
Yeah something about baby you and I 

It's been two years since I let you go 
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll

On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold

Time ta take off partna, alright
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-G
Get your doe or die partna
Yup, let's go

Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah you know what it is
Pockets full of number of rubber bands and bills
Came up around that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal about 60 mill
You ain't live that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it, quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

Airbody want that money what you want
High as hell trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money could never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably
A dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels n' drugs

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money",Jewels N' *****,2013

(Our lovers quarrel)
I was thinking about you
(More than I can say)
And it was kind of dirty
(All night)
And the way that you looked at me
(Help me here)
It was kind of nasty
(Help me here)
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn you were in my x dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my x dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my x dreams

We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
He was kinda nasty (help me here)
'Cause I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our head

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
And I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you

Last night
Damn you were in my x dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my x dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my x dreams
Making love in my x dreams
Making love in my x dreams
Making love in my x dreams

You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

I can't believe I'm telling you this but
I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god

Last night
Damn you were in my x dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)

So I said, ""I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever

Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own

Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick

And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight

And then he asked me,
Said, ""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple.
It's the way that you love and treat your mother""

Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life

Would you go with me?
(For life)
See the world with me

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

Came up around that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal about 60 mill
You ain't live that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it, quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

E'verbody want that money what you want
High as hell trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money could never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably
A dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels n' drugs

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake

Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family

A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it?
He is cold, I agree
He can laugh but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each Spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him

Lady Gaga,"Love is funny, or it's sad
Or it's quiet, or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful

And I'm thinking if you were mine I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I know

Lady Gaga,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak (me too)
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

And I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through

To heaven (heaven), yes I'm in heaven (I'm in heaven)
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Lady Gaga,"You are the summer and I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
My songs go on when yours has just begun
Don't wait too long

Fall is a lovely time of the year
When the leaves turn to golden brown
But soon fall is ending and winter is near
And the leaves start tumblin' down oh oh

Why must the moments go by in such haste?
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming, we've no time to waste
Don't wait too long

And while my heart's gay and foolish
And free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me
Don't you wait too long

Lady Gaga,"We love each other so deeply
That I ask you, the sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever, never to part

Every time we say goodbye I die a little
Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Every time we say goodbye",Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,2014

Lady Gaga,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingué traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
A thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will
Oh yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,2014

A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea

A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

Is just to love and be loved in return""

And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away

I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
Oh no, sophisticated lady,
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh you cry

He has a funny way saying forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp

She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep

He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Lady Levi,"Hey, nah ya goin miss up on the G-Funk era,
Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar

11-10-7 D that was my intro
But now in 94, I'm rollin a 64
'Cause things get shady where the grass is greener
Niggaz throwin up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And its a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the niggaz you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all
I got my own thang 'cause I let my nuts hang
If you want to bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad 
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em

It's all plain and simple
I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggaz
Idiotic fools can't figure
The way I display or should I say more than that
Its crucial when I name how many niggaz got my back
Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine
You can't front if you want to but you still know the time 
I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean)
I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team
So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll
This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before
So recognize game in your face
A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace

[Chorus]

I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you don't look good
So please rearrange and change the shit you doin'
You fuckin' yourself 'cause you the one gettin' screwed
As I, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So blaze up the Buddha
'Cause I got drink, and don't think
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb ass shit called the funk
'Cause I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Niggaz flip flop and they neva stay down
Want to be all they can be, but gettin' held back
Tryin' to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways

Which half are you gonna choose?
Uh huh alright let's go
Deitrick:

[CHORUS 1:]
Where did you lose your faith?
And why did you walk away?
You gained the world
Was it worth your soul?
Now you're standing at the crossroads
Gonna be the day you gained the world
All the Benjamen's and girls
Bet you have everything in your hands
But what about the masters plans?
And of all the change and fame
You gave up your faith
Was it worth the sacrifice?
For you to lose your life?
Oh oh

[CHORUS 2:]
Take my hand
Let me lead the way
Won't you take my hand?
Let me lead you to a brighter day
A brighter day
I know you think nobody knows
That your standing at the crossroads

Walking around empty inside
'cause the pain you're trying to hide
Deep down there's misery
And you think that he can't see
But God understands 
Won't you take my hand?
You don't have to hurt no more
God is knocking at your door

[CHORUS 2:]

Lady Life:
Yea, ok, now
At some point we all come to these crossroads
I'm at these crossroads yea
Tryna make a decision
Contemplating my roles
Taking the way that I'm living
Steady repeating
'cause I'm really just tryna stay sane
Change ways haters want to send me
Straight to the grave
But I ain't havin it
I already made up my mind
I'm headed for the straight and narrow
Steady ready to grind 
Ready to shine
'cause the life is back again
Ain't gonna be no suckers for suckers
Who are down for sin

Comes to crazy dough, I never get enough

Like no eye contact, pounds with the left

If you get offended, I'm talkin? to you
Come get it, and there'll be a coffin for you
You done did it, you messin? wit Luck, you pressin? your luck
Got lots of jewels and I ain't givin? 'em up, sho nuff

Have your thuggest thug come get it back for y'all niggas
Laugh at y'all niggas, throw caps at y'all niggas
Stick NBA for the basketball figures

Jiggalo men wit two hoes, John Ritter
Arm lit up, microphone tormenter
I'm hungry as fuck and I came to eat
If you came to shoot Doc can you aim at least

Bricks, sucker MC?s that stay hookin? off
You boogie hoes like, this what I'm lookin? for
Duke, your moms think I'ma helluva guy

When I spit y'all become fiends to me
Crack cost money, but the D is free

Ayo Luck, do you really know what pressure is?

Nigga, I apply it
The one stealing TV?s at the Rodney King riot
Guns on salas, whips no mileage
At the bar three iced teas, Long Island

I stay stylin?, boots stay filled with weed
In the V, lane three, switchin? up speed
I'ma be obnoxious until I can't breathe
And until then, y'all can't win

Luck's twelve on a scale from one to ten
Influenced by hydro and lots of gin
Nigga back up, damn I need oxygen
Surrounded by lots of men that'll rock your chin
And pop your limbs

Handle like Iverson, or Marbury
Flows extraordinary
How bout the gold Chevy, holdin? the four steady
Been runnin? war, let me know when whore's ready

Yo shut the fuck up!

Bitches in the back, like crack get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked, smacked or fucked up
Pull the truck up, Luck you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shittin' on the game
I suppose what you're spittin' is flames, cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal, I could smell the dooch powder
Summer's Eve, I drop degrees chill
Come four by four, lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly 'til you air sick, now that's ill
Two choices, either squeeze or peel, now that's real

Miraculous rhyme flow, back track to the Immaculate
Binaca blast nigga that's fast, son I'll out-box ya
Ladies rub the ta-ta's, bras, titties and knockers on the floor
Owww! Fellas pull ya cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third round knock out
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigger-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2pac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls

Wu-Tang death penalty, the gas chamber
This gon' hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap ya like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me
The same way I'mma feel this world when it kill me

Double up on that cash if you decide to invest

And I bet, when I go plat, you'll sound like me

Good God, my whole squad hard
And bank accounts is large

Nigga pump it fast like why",Rush,2000
Lady Luck,"Don't get nuthin' confused about me, this nigga hea throw clips
You think you could hold three, nigga hea go six
I bring heat like Deniro flix, my team lock and load
And rock and roll like Aerosmith

Fuck cops I got Cochran Shapiro chips
One point five in ice in each earlobe shit
Fuck who you and your man go get
Me and cat take pussy's on boat rides on some Soprano shit

Move wit troops in cougar coupes
Like beeno and notes for a G a piece, they'll remove your roof
Ya better spread when the ruger shoot
Paul Cane got fire, everything ya heard on Clue was the truth

It's like who want what what ever
Yo and your man play tough ya gon' get plucked together
At gun point gettin stuck together
Black Benz tinted out, buggy headlights stuck together

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

They said I rap like a man and act like a man
So when it come to war she gon' clap like a man
Short arrogant wit this gat up in my hand
Chicks don't play cute I'm still attractin' your man, come on

Rock many lands, Japan to Philly sands
Luck stay ghetto like Rican dolla bands
Only thing I take serious is garments and money
And late periods, there she is

Screamin in a two by two, too fly two seater
Too much ice, too cold, two heaters
Love men but got lesbian guns
That love to lick off at you pussies for fun

So play dumb in these dum dups, hit you where you pump cum
Stick you for your lump sums, we the ones you run from
Till the day my lungs done for blocks
I hit hard like Ronnie Lotts, lady Luck got it locked

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

Ya talkin' greasy like Paul ain't a nigga wit fire
Like I ain't got guns or killers for hire
Got wolves that'll run through mask and arms
Like point break clear the safe out and smash your moms

Over 40 years old still blastin' chrome
Smiles never cross they face till there's cash in palm
'Cause they still do murders for bucks
Have 'em put hollow points through you then pass the burner to luck

We like a two G Bonnie and Clyde, back to back in beef
Wit two heats a piece, mami gon' ryde
Spit four, she behind me wit five
You know Paul Cane and Lady Luck MO catch homo's and slide

Before we drop the guns
Wipe off the prints, push the pedal through the floor
And get away back to the bricks, ya don't want nothin' wit us
Paul Cane, Street Life, Desert Storm, we're dangerous

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us, come on

Strut around nose up with a attitude
Flaunt jewels, haunt crews, Luck is bad news
Pull 'em out a tool, show ya what a MAC'll do

Aim for your North Face coat
Or put three up in your small face and a couple up in your throat
Far from a joke, AND it's that time of the month
My niggas came to the party drunk, gettin' it crunk

They say it's, type foul how I look at life now
Slumped in the drop with a loaded ri-fle
Type wild, lifestyle, dizzy off Cris-tal
Talk with a lisp now, walk with a limp now

Must be a pit now, I'm always with my man
Grand in my hand just signed to Def Jam
Along with Nia Long lookin' for ""The Best Man""
Lay up in the wet sands when not in the 'luxe Land

You heard ""blaka blaka"" coward get your coke and rocks up
Somebody call the cops up, need vice squad to stop up
Doin' a buck-thirty zone in a big poppa

The type to snatch you out your car and take your wallet nigga
(Get outta there!) I roll with 'cause-ons, fam get your thug on

Where the rocks be? Where the jocks be?
You grab a glock and let it pop if you gon' stop me

I'm probably hot, the Goddess in here
Better spit your hardest this year, I'm starvin this year
Regardless who here, Luck gon' murder the flow
You broke-ass niggaz act like you allergic to dough

Never get none nigga let your lip run
And watch my clique come, cock back and spit one (blaow!)
Move smoother than the juices when my clit cum (uhh)
And every time I rock, watch my pockets thick-en

Y'all ride dick on any cat that can buy the P-rada
And scatter my motto why bother when Luck about dollars
Female rap Tony Montana bubble like saunas
Bring the armor make your block look like a tiny Pearl Harbor
You wants no drama

I fell in love with the sex hickeys on my tities
Bite marks on my neck wifey like next 
But now you get vexed and in the last six months
Seems you lost respect you don't call when you hang out
Ball with the range out act all wild in the mall want to bang out
Shit nigga you don't know who I be
Instead of flippin on me get a J.O.B.

Loud talkin pickin my clothes like a orphan 
And when ever I'm out you be stalkin
911 paging you be callin what so important
Use the bathroom then you come back and say you want to talk
With your hands not washed and the seat up
Get a job and get your ass up and make the bed up yeah

What do you do when your man is a bum
can't keep a job for more than a month
Your friends don't like him and his game is dead
You blew it off with him cause he's good in bed
Take your keys and throw them out
Or just get mad and run your mouth
You work all day he's on the couch
Don't that make you want to blackout

[Chorus]
Think I'm about to blackout blackout 
Grabin out wildin out 
Flippin on me I'm flippin on you
Don't want to make me act a fool
Think I'm about to blackout blackout
Grabin out wildin out
don't want to lose my cool
I'm about to blackout on you

Talkin like you got room 
Don't even clean the house
Never seen a broom
Movin my shit don't know where its at
I told you more than once I wasn't havin that
I'm about to blackout got to let it out
Doin crazy things make me want to shout
Blowin up my cell what's that all about
Sayin you was home when I seen you out
I'm havin doubts

Now what do you do when your girls a bird
Pack her shit kick to the curb
Lose your cool catch your case
Sleep wit her friends throw it back in her face
Do ya take her back try again
can't leave home don't trust your friends
Turn your back she'll play you out
Don't that make you want to blackout

[Chorus]

Clothes smellin like perfume or makeup 
Call me somebody else when we make love
You trickin my dough at the strip club
You think its a game but I'm gettin fed up
You talkin in codes on your cell phone 
You do it on the low like I ain't gon know
You movin too fast better slow down
You playin me close gonna make me blackout

Yo pluck an independent woman like beyonce
And I could give a damn what you and your boyz say
No need to kick me out I don't want to stay
Pack the coach bags and be on my way I don't need you 
You need a broad that wake up in the morn clean cook and feed you
And that ain't luck nigga that's what's up
Key up the truck and clear the bank account when I blackout

O mal do dia-a-dia já nem lembro mais
E mata a minha sede, cura minha dor

A nossa história parece um filme
Que assistimos na semana passada
Final feliz, isso é normal
Realidade é muito mais virtual
Não tem ressentimento pois contigo aprendi
Que desse amor não podemos fugir
Cartas sobre a mesa, não podemos negar
Nada é perfeito mas eu quero é jogar
Eu quero é jogar (zaia!)

O problema é que pra mim você perdeu a pose
É tudo igual Marlene, Bete Davis ou Rose

And why, oh baby why,you make me into your clown?

If I give you the chance I know you would leave me now,baby
After all we've been through, our plans about tomorrow
You've broken my heart, baby, you've ruined my soul
Is there a chance for me, tell me or let me go

Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off

Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes

Lady Saw,"If I can give myself all the reason for being with you, 
I can't see why you can't give me reason for your acting 
through all these funny things like stayin' out late at night, 
making me spend all sobbing lonely nights, baby, you know 
you're drivin' me crazy, you've been truth(?) for me 

Just give me a reason why we fuss and fight 
Give me a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights 
Is there a reason why you fall for other girls 
When I thought I was the number one lady in your world 

Just give me a reason why you make me cry 
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights 
Tell me the reason why you tow around the world 
And why, in God's name, you want to make me into your girl 

Even though, baby, you did me wrong, baby 
The feeling inside of me, baby, is - ooh so strong 
I've tried in a million ways to make you happy 
But I keep on wondering, do you love me 

Just give me a reason why we fuss and fight 
I need a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights 
Is there a reason why you fall for other girls 
When I thought I was the number one lady in your world 

Just give me a reason why you make me cry 
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights 
Tell me the reason why you tow around the realm 
And why, oh baby why,you make me into your clown 

If I give you the chance I know you would leave me now,baby 
After all we've been through, our plans about tomorrow 
You've broken my heart, baby, you've ruined my soul 
Is there a chance for me, tell me or let me go 

Just give me a reason why we fuss and fight 
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights 
Is there a reason why you fall for other girls 
When I thought I was the number one lady in your world 

Just give me a reason why you make me cry 
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights 
Tell me the reason why you tow around the world 
And why, in God's name, do you make me into your girl ? 

Why, in God's name, did I build my world around you, baby ? 
When all that you do, baby, is make me so blue 
I've tried in a million ways to make you happy 
But I keep on wondering, do you love me ?

Alright... 
First of all 

When you wake up in the evening and the day is shot 
Find yourself complaining about the things you ain't got

Make the world a better place 
Put a smile on your face 
(Whatcha gonna do, say, whatcha gonna do) 

And another thing 
You can say I'm a dreamer and you thinks it's all cool 
Preaching about the better life I learned in school 
But you get what you give in this life that we live 
And all that you do will come back to you 

Chorus 

[Lady Saw] 
Yo 
When thing's isn't right, there's not need to fight-a

Don't forget to smile 
Give love to our nation, big or small 
When you do good, you'll get your reward 
United with undivided we fall 
Put a smile on your face and greet one and all

I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better... better... 

[Lady Saw:]
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
And each time you're around
My body keeps stalin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's an underside to you
That so many adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
You're good for me, baby
Oh that, I'm sure
Over and over again
I want more

[Gwen:]
You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

[Repeat Chorus]

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lovely
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

Lady Saw,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",Wrong Time,2005
Lady Saw,"Take me you are the one
Let's go for one another
See, this ain't no joke
Say, I don't want no other
Let me be your friend
Cock father kid and brother
Will you be my pussy cat
Sister kid mother
Come on ride my verse
Come on play my tune
From the first to the worst
You my every wound
High up like birds
We will use our zoom
And realize the curse
It's not in your room
You make my whole entire world
Turn around, you the one
You set the roof on fire girl
You heat up my burning sun
We'll push things higher than
We have never ever done
We'll teach our daughter
And we'll teach our son

Please please
Gimme your love
I'll please
You and your love
Please please
I am your man, I am your friend
Come again

You can be my lover
Oh yes, you can
You got my heart in the palm of your hand
I don't need another
You're my only man
And I'll never leave your side
Please understand
That man like you are only a few
I admire all the things you do
Baby my love is all for you
I pry that god will see us through
You amaze me
You drive me crazy
Trust me my love
I'm glad to be your lady
Nothing can't face me
Daily you praise me
Tell me say me sweeter
Than a rose naimed daisy
Yes, I'll please you
Never never leave you
Just like the air that I breathe
That's how I need you
I'll never teese you
Pumper and squeese you
When you want love
To the bedroom me lead you

Please 

You can be my lover
I don't need another
Rest your head upon my shoulder
I need to hold you closer
Listen up we only play
The game we want
We're the ones to say
How it will be done
No time to waste
And no reason to wait
You always give me update
You are my number one
We pull up and stay up
Here we are strong
This is our way
And that's were we belong
Feel it day by day
Til those days are gone
We all gotta pay
But we all gain some
Crazy for your style
I wanna smoke it like dope
Your ideas make me smile
Your ideals gimme hope
Kiss my soul with your eyes
Love is globber than the globe
Everyday I realize
I feel for you this ain't no joke

Lady Sovereign,"Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

(Whoa! Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something?
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me, look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, yeah, but, what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you, too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I'll continue
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

And just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

You're fit but you know it
But you know it
You're fit but you know it

But's better than the jobs from state,
For makin' it, mate, just a Q and A.

Still ghetto wit they mind of a needle
Quicker than a cheetah,

Steady, walk forward in my Timberland boots
And I still ready to shoot, you need proof?

Show it any time
Fuck a label, I never get signed!
More time, niggas wanna leave me behind.
Tell me to put my name on they dotted line.

Ya find, the way I am contracts to they street
Come around, will you?
In the last two weeks, you're too weak.

I still represent Hays Town.
Though it's my proximity, my boy face down.
Murder mans, niggas fast like a greyhound
Quick to run in the bank, and tell ya lay down.

Style to the manner, got a place in the manor
Like a .38, always come back to the man-ner.
That's grammar.

Use it punk, big like they clumps.
You versus me equals my car trunk.

Come up they light's in they low power,
Remember they time when you got slaughtered,

Little boys left on they kerb.
People, lift them up before dey get hurt.
But their heart rate stop (beeep)
When they have just learned

Leave yer mind in high-low
Like they center of a polo, push
Can't enter his height when I'm so low,
Yah, yeh don't know, so --

None a yer words can hurt me, fool.
None a yer combacks mean f*k, fool.
Nuffin' you say can hurt me, fool.

Oi! 'ey, lissen up,
Don't get f*cked up I go through PMS,
My mood swings leave niggas in a state of
Distress.

Doesn't spit about a rattle man's chest


Accordings to these angles, if dere was a circle
Yeah! -- play, boy, but I know my swivin' hurt you.


I take you for a joke, so you get laffed at (haha)
Yer a basic MC, boy. I'm done -- past it.

Cause my microphone sample is in they silence,
Leaving, yeh suddenly need stabilizers.
Yeah wanted to battle me like an idiot.
But I'll show everyone (sure!) here that yerr not
Ready yet.

I'll leave you body wrapped, body bagged, in a closed hearse.
Leff it in they church, can I really get worse?
Cannot rilly know that I jes silly caught, seen me

But I'm still here, cause I move like the wind.

Goin' to make havoc -- spit til I choke.
How could anyone ever better me for a joke.
See they tick-tock? on they body clock, I put it on stop.
If you wanna come and drop a lyric, there is no top.

But if you had it, you still couldn't rhyme
You still couldn't write (nah) in beat to dis time
So you never get close enough to me to attack.
You take two steps forward, but three steps back.


Cause I'm daily separatin' mens day out day in,
Leaving them with no self-esteem, meditating
And don't think of it, Unless its how I'll make you lose your confidence.
Even how you spittin on dis track is never-never lan'.

You. can't. spit. and. it's. better. dat. you. quit.

And your Miss Dynamite
Impressions ain't botherin' no one.
So thanks but nah. Get yer own slogan!

Take that! Matter of fact, get off they track.
I'm too classy to go back-to-back
With your average hood-rats.

What you know about markin' yer game
Up yer walls? Nuffin.
Spittin crap at yer sympathizers. (nuffin!)

Treat yeh frauds like Kit-Kat

Cause yer unknown and fake,
Cause yer bound to hate.

Dey wanna beee like us!! (I know)
But they're featherweight,
And I'm a heavyweight.
Eatin' MCs like ready-break.

If that's the case, imagine what the skets get slapped.
Quick and exit. (huh huh)
And home it crept. Must be men!

But you get blazed off they set.
Trust if you be Sovereign, I'm Benson and hedges
Don't to trust get me like anesthetics.
Even wif Gab's compressor, ya still sound lesser.
So don't get it twisted, girls -- you aint better.

Man, I take down your whole 'hood with my four wood.

Better den yours, times ten.
I rhyme couple time, I punish you in line,
You could never take Zuz for a spin.

My vendetta is simply payback
Write lyrics with no pen, no paper.

Easily kill you hos, I won't lose. ZU-ZU!

Tame your voice when you talk big my sh*t is real
I kill your little kids like mornin'-after pills

When you walked in, I met ends, it's not happenin'.
I still strappin' my nine, I still rappin' part time.
Lemme up, I take ye back they old ways.
Yeah don't wanna see me take it back to old days --

I favored Frost P like a maniac. (he's great)
'Cos I'm back, I show you where the f*ks izzat.

I'm still one of a kind, win they war with me?
Killed twenty-two (22.) MCs,
Them wanna make it twenty-three (23!).

[SHYSTIE]
I'll slew you, hands tied behind my fat*ss
No lies, I will even close my eyes.
Turn aroun', with my back faced
In yer face, switch place.
Spit my lyrics in yer face like mace.

[SOV]
Yo, my eyes --------
I pity they fool who will sell it
Like dresser, uh huh.

Wot right about now (yo)
But can you do a little?

[FROST P]
Rose, never stoppin'.
I called they rolls, twenty years old.
I still hop on the bus with a child bus pass.
We ain't stoppin for queues we just rush past
Educated, but yep, I still bunk class!

[ZUZ ROCK]
See, I'm renegade. Roll wid they R.O.C.,
Plus, we fully stocked wid they nine milli
'Cos we hotter than the sahara desert
Afta banned and a filly,

[SHYSTIE]
A lotta people know Shystie they renegade,
I keep gasses out they bottle, but it's not lemonade.
So -- don't get twisted, 'cos I'm not Shy.
Give a bad look, get a right hook in yer eye!

[FROST P]
Fat man that man I pull scares like anthrax
Leave a boy lookin, zip is lips wit' Tampax!
Wit my accent, jack all they lime off they track.
Make a used door sound like ""Oh dear, Maxwell""

[ZUZ ROCK]
Still --
Huffing and puffing and bluffing
And not on a double to nuttin'.
I doubled up when I f*d yer girlfriend,
Double the trouble, when I doubled they barrel,
R.O. dubbed it, so you won't be into lurin'

[SOV]
Yeah don't wanna look in my eye, fool!

Yeah'll see black and white,
Like a black tie ball, so --

My voice hits cars, I love music,
Kept my voice locked in a jar for years,
Now I'm here I know you loved the way I appeared,

The vibe that's been hiding like Bin Laden,
Turn the noise down, I beg your pardon,
I get ya, let this shit rumble your garden as the bass hardens,

They wanna go silly like the Baha Men,

Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya,

Beside the fact that I blare my music all the time,

The music in question is here caving your chest in,
And I ain't got time for resting,
I'm never snoring,
Interesting, my living room noises are never boring,
Grannys wanna kick my door in,
We're constantly warring till one in the mornin'
Now lights off, lights on, I'm teasing them,
They think I've gone to sleep but I'm changin' CD's again,
Now don't go on like you don't like it,
You're only moaning cause your records are shit,
And they skip, now just zip your lip,
And come to my yard and flip the script,

You been on too many catalogue sprees
With your grannyfied curtain designs, your hurting my eyes,
You really should revise your dress sense before you walk on by,
I'm kinda mixed up in this disco inferno,
Baggy jeans and a tight top, lemonade and pernod
I'm sticking out like a sore thumb but I ain't concerned though, no, uh oh,oh oh oh (boogie)

[Chorus: x2]
Fling on an A D I D A S hoodie and just boogie woogie with me 
Ohhhhh...
Or you can just. put on your dancing shoes and get loose
Can you get loose can you??

So I was up in this trendy bar mingling
My keys around my neck were jingling
And you was looking at me like it was my bling
You was staring at me like to say I was ginger
I was dishing out out the same dirty looks trust me your the minger

Err, who's she, who's that, who's her??
The bouncer was approaching me coz I was dressed really inappropriately
No hood, no hats, no this, no that
Let's rolluh olll uh olll ..(out)

[Chorus: x2]

Right everybody, if you've got someone who can't dress properly, 
Yeah you need to direct them this way.

Why not just cut up all your old clothes and make a quilt 
So I can wrap myself up when I'm feeling cold,
Why not dash your ugly boots on the fire and burn them down to charcoal,
If your not feeling the way that your bedrin is dressing don't be stressing 

Send them in my direcion please,
Black shoes , white socks, no uhh ohhh
Polka dots, no uhh ohhh
Flowery frocks, no uhh ohhh

I won't go back to my minimum wages

At Macy is at about half three 
What you munching on? 
Ur Quarter-pounder with cheese? 
Chatting about me and my abilities 
Now S.O.V you wish! 
S.O.V can't speak! 
S.O.V just quit! 
Aw whatever don?t talk with your mouth full! 
That's right discussing me, it?s all publicity 
Even if you don't like me your still dashing my name around the city 
Its all good though, blup blup publicity for free! 
White midget, a huh might fidget 
Somebody just dialed my digits 
Is it for your nan? Ha! Is it? Flatter for the way that you use your credit 
If you go say I'm nobody 
Well if I'm nobody then why are you ringing me?! 
You drained your credit that's filling it 
Wow my style, you sure your not feeling it?

What we tell them? In one ear and it comes straight out the other 
Repeating yourself like you got a stutter 
With all your mutter like 
Why do we ever suffer? I dunno 
All your words in my brain turning into clutter 
Repeating yourself like you got a stutter 
With all your mutter like 

People want to classify me as an Eminem 
What hear what I'm a different kind of specimen 
Just because I be a white Caucasian 
Doesn't mean me and him are the same because 
One I'm not American 
Two I'm not a man 
Three I come into with a different kind of plan 
Setting the facts straight cos I know that I can 
Will it ever wait cos I do the ultravan 
Categories I don't fit into any 
Why? I'm onto top the stars many 
Writing out more lines than Burberry 
Then it will be like a victim of 20

Make them drink my saliva off the floor 
That spit not spat 
When I walked in the door 
Release my metaphor 
Like cor blimey its the while girl ess oh vee!

I know you don't boast about me over your Sunday roast 
Or mid-morning cheese on toast

SOV you know you ain't white? 
SOV I love your track? 
Well what you want bitch a pound in d bank? 
I?m varying cos I'm soon to be beg friend

They only start caring when your preparing the next big riddem 
That gets the kids
And Oh god I got posh people swearing 
The rich (ch-ching) the poor the snobs the whores

There's four on the couch,
There's five runnin' about,

Before it's 'ding ding' and your lights are out
Or you get left out like the ginge from girls aloud,
Someone's vomiting, gimme the sponge and towel,
Allow it, I ain't cleanin' up her sick,
Why have another sip if you can't handle it,

Stay awake before I do something random,
Permanent markers on their face I'll brand them,

Shouting like some off-key punk,

This is my England I'm letting you know now,

No I don't watch the Antiques Roadshow, I'd rather listen Run the Road,
And smoke someone's fresh homegrown,
And not get bloated on a plate of scones,
Cricket, bowls, croquet, nah PS2 all the way, in an English council apartment,
We don't all wear bowler hats and hire servants,
More like 24 hour surveillance and dog shit on pavements,

We ain't all posh like the queen, we ain't all squeaky clean,
Now do the Tony Blair, throw your hands in the air now everytwhere,
We ain't all posh like the queen, we ain't all squeaky clean,

This is the picture I painted my low down,
This my London that I call my home town,
It's where I'm living and this is my low down,
This is my England I'm letting you know now,

Big up Oliver Twist, letting us know the nitty gritty of what London really is,
It ain't all pretty, deal with the realness, it's all gritty, deal with the realness,
Oh the changing of the Queen's guard, that's nothing for me to come out of the house form
Tra la la, I'd rather sit on my ass,
And have a glass of Chardonnay, nah
We ain't all Briget Jones clones, who say pardon me,
More like gwanin mate, You get me...
Now I can select a few, paper people like to reject all my views,
Well I'm letting you know the news and
Well, this is the straight up truth,

Lady Traffic,"Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning

Lady Traffic,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight,2008

Yo see-Murder, you believe all these people they call me hopeless.

They say when your hopeless your not expected to do good, be successful.
And it's by all means impossible to accomplish any goals.

[Magic]
Look here, it's not easy I struggled to get in this position
Taking my people out the ghetto was my only mission
I was jacking and strong arming accomplished i done changed
Making money living good I'm out of the game
See as I refused to see good in my accomplishments
All I ever get is dirty looks, never compliments
I figure jealousy, wishing that why'all could be me
Cause I'm living larger then life at the age of twentythree (ha ha)
a lot of pessimistic people is speaking about my lifestyle
So when I enter the center I look for the smiles
Many expected me to go down the tubes
Now the same people wishing that they could be in my shoes
But I'm the one they call hopeless
Lord forgive em for thinking that I was worthless
I forgive and forget
And I learn from every life experience
I hope why'all feel every word cause this is real it gets
They call me hopeless

And I'm up to my head in it
[Sons of Funk]
And I'm up to my head in it, up to my head in it, oh

[C-Murder]
They said I'm hopeless and I never make it
They doubt it, call me an outcast because I'm bout it
Now why you want to label me and say I'm a thug
I never said I wasn't because this ghetto is in my blood
But I maintain through poverty and tears
My only wish was that I make it to see another year
I left my dreams up in the penn, feel my constant struggle
And one man against a nation, damn I miss my brother
I walk a path to a dead end cause I'm lonely
A childhood full of rainy days kept me homeless
I always wondered was I cursed
Since birth I felt I never had a fair chance in life on this wreched earth
My lonely memories of the past, they got me thinking
I don't want to see the future, but die in vain
I ask the Lord will he forgive me
Before I leave this world I want to live a better life because I'm hopeless

Towering over your head.

And she's gone.

where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Wrapped his body and sealed up the grave

Ladye Love Smith,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages 
On that line stands an old rugged cross 
On that cross, a battle is raging 
To gain a man's soul or it's loss 

On one side, march the forces of evil
 All the demons, all the devils of hell 
On the other, the angels of glory 
And they meet on Golgotha's hill 

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict 
And the sun refuses to shine 
For there hangs God's son, in the balance 
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over 
It is finished, there'll be no more war 
It is finished, the end of the conflict 
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging 
Not all prisoners of war had come home 
These were battlefields of my own making 
I didn't know that the war had been won 

Oh, but then I heard the king of the ages 
Had fought all the battles for me 
And that victory was mine for the claiming 
And now praise his name, I am free",The Old Rugged Cross,2011
