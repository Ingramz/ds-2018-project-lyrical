Pee Wee Russell Quartet,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1965
Pee Wee Russell's Rhythmakers,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee! 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her,

How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night,

Change her mind about me!

It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly
Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs
People want to know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang

Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing
Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they got your number
The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they watch your mother

Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinng
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow

Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow 
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest
Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap

About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you
Treat it just like that...

[Chorus: x 2]
[Peedi C] Now one's for Peedi Crakk
[Freeway] And two's for Free'
[Young C] Three for Young Gunna
[B Sigel] And four for Sig'
[Peedi C] You know it's SP yes we above of those things
First the mack go ring, and when it's done it go ting

[Freeway]
All of the sudden and there's six million ways to rhyme
There's still six million ways to D-I-E
I'll smack your P-why-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga
I live me rhymes, why'all ain't Free

But why'all know why'all heard of him
Niggaz can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted
Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality

Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a rose

So what if it's brown from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back
Free, house the trap, push the release day back
Me and crack at it again, add it to wax

[Chorus]

[Young Chris]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner
Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang
Mami's spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same

Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang
Niggaz they act dumb act they think, thangs
Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing
Niggaz on the street whisperin', Police District and

Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear
The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em
Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them
Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him

Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em
Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too
But our father, the number when he ready too
Do not bother the rumble, niggaz ready too, bang you in a second
Keep the banger for protection

[Chorus]

[Beanie Sigel]
It ain't a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name B. Siggy, Mac Milly, Mac Mittens
Broad Street Bully, Mac go fully, bitch
My whole squad sing chiti-bang, bang

Make the city gangbang, stay pop, chain GANG
Why'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs
Nigga, we can do the damn thang
The war ain't over 'til that fat bitch sang

Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again

It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne
Got bitches on the thang, thang
Because they like the way the S.P. chain swings
City of Philly, you know that city brought your city the slang
My squad with me, and they ready to bang, bang

Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
Cause the heat call me a liar
She just like +Honey+ so I called her Mariah
want to see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist

Criminal background, State Prop's back now
Lookin' for a squad like ours, picture that clown
Difference in them verses what we talk we live it too
They just beats and hooks far from lyrical
Just a lil' piece of mind I thought I'd share with you
They don't really care for you
Be a lil' careful, you
Might think you sharin' ya shit
And the weirdest shit
Then next time you hear his shit
You hearin' you
That just let's me know I'm gift with the lyrics too
While I don't take it personal
Reverse em' when they share with you
Keep her near you, unless you sharin'
'cause I party mines
Sippin' on my name while you lames drinks Bacardi lime
I'm takin' brains for the game when it's party time
Thinkin' you here to hang with the gang?
Well I'm sorry ma
Go ahead ma, keep ya ol' man Chris
Not Ronnie, ain't no old man shit
Plus you know this

Criminals grindin', you hear us rhymin'
But at the same time nines is in alignment

As if Peedi and them Youngins won't find em
As if B. Sig and Freeweez ain't behind em

Know Crakk pick up on em bitches like Chevys
Got my Avalanche tinted, know who in it P and Lezzy (P and Lezzy)
Blowin',???? then he passed it to Haniffy
Tell me Crakk is off his grindin'
I'm in the heaviest weight class ho
C.R.E.A.M's say blast
Got a camera in my bathroom lookin' at ya ass
Know my whirl-a-frame playin' too bout to break fast
Get a half, while my nigga Tommy Buttas do the math (do the math)
It's like a capsule, you can see it from the past
From the way they call me Crakk, from upstate I'm countin' cash
From Montgomery's ass
I might blast you, look at my lap, I'm in the cash rule
The girls feel so good, but the brain is not ready, I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman, 'cause their mind is so steady, now here we go

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
I undastand that the ROC a crowded family
But I gotta lotta family
And I'm one of the hottest
I know the fans runnin' to cop us
Will need that jam that have Def Jam want em to drop us
Can't none of them stop us, one in the top plus
Ya don't really live it ya'll runnin' the blockbust
They get it from the flicks (watchin' too many movies)
Now watch them cameras
If they don't get it from a snitch, they get it from the flicks
I limit on these chicks, and kinda when I get head
Ever since they told me you could get it from the lips
I never hadda pops, I can get it from some shit
Used to get it on the strip, or they get it from the clips

Without a rhyme about the nine and what the Tech do

With AK shells through your Teflon vest too

It's shit bags and them Catholic's passed out
Shoot up the crack house, smack worker's bond like crack's out

The mac's get backed out, the air's get dust off
The cage get bust off, the shaft and the stock get cut off
Your cash and your block get cut off

Only gettin' money, on the Maranda

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out

All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Hey who got the politicians in they back pocket
Pimp slap pump that gimme that profit
When you make contact gimme that gossip
If you break contract you'll be that hostage

Better deadbolt the door it ain't safe no more

Approach with caution be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feelin' of course is something thats hard to describe I'm half dead never felt more alive
Reborn removed the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down but now I'm back up
Bout to act up boy you better back up
When you see me set up shop know to pack up
I crack up when a rapper gets slapped up
Number one reason yall should give rap up
Dice it's mine, I got it all wrapped up

Um strapped I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now lets go! you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show I start it with a can I get a ho and the hoes go retarded
The popo tape off the stage for caution, its badlands north philly get it in!

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Struck by the luck of the draw
Real life preservation
What I'm hustling for
My name black thought
The definition of raw
I was born in South Philly
On a cement floor
I had nothing at all
Had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall
Be another brick in the wall
Another life
Full of love
That lost
That's silly
This Philly
Y'all really ain't stoppin'
The boy with the pen
Like Willie
On top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city
Most popular for
Hear the tones
That will ease you
Smooth
As Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin' your head boppin' and all
It's something in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody fifty cents
From a quarter
Where I come from
Yeah
The streets ain't timid
But I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people
I ain't got at
In a minute
Yeah
You can take a brother outta South Philly
Can't take it outta him really
I forever represent it
And it's

Live and dirvet

Remember mommy told me
You ain't write that
It started in the bathroom taking a dump
Listening to Ultramagnetic
Ego tripping you won't
Pressure my word
I'm the urban vision
Of you chump
Stomped on a different ground
Sound second to none
Synthesizers tweet
To improvise your feet
I calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat
It's free
Come get high on me
Before a nine millimeter shell
Hit my pelle pelle
In the p
Yeah
It's somethin' in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody
Fifty cents from a quarter
Yo
Where I come from
It's just a natural reaction
For crack to make it happen
Let the pen ink sink
Into the paper of the pad
Think back
When I was younger
Ghetto could have took me under
Young Peedi can't mess with North Philly
Never had
You don't know about me
You ain't stroll my streets
Look familiar
I feel ya
Longtime no see

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Clap somethin'
But whatever you clap
Clap to the record spinnin'
While I'm takin' you back
To the top paper era
Baby big on that
Picture the pool room
Where the money getters was at
And street people
With feather in the cap
Or their bossolino pullin' paper
As if it's a small casino
I was a young boy
Sweepin' the floors
And runnin' to stores
But all those old heads
Would talk to me About the way
To clutch the eagle
On a buck and truck
And if I'm down
How to get back up
Just survival kid
And it's a struggle worldwide
I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well
Be the Gaza Strip
You know where all the monsters is
Street walkers
You don't see no consciousness I'm coming back to where
The core of the problem is
We on the job again
Y'all know what time it is

Peedi Peedi,"Look my squad's half mandrill half Mandela
My band bout seventy strong just like fela
Yeah part Melly Mel part Van Halen
And we represent illadel where they still rebellin'
A yo sicko show like mike moore's
My city ain't nothing like your's
Slippin' into darkness like war! night-crawl
With the lights off, you see a lot of life loss for the white horse
Regardless, the charges makin' us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Hey who got the politicians in they back pocket
Pimp slap pump that gimme that profit
When you make contact gimme that gossip
If you break contract you'll be that hostage
They getting busy in the city it's raw
Better deadbolt the door it ain't safe no more

Southside get busy yall
Northside get busy yall
Westside get busy yall
Worldwide get busy yall

Approach with caution be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feelin' of course is something thats hard to describe I'm half dead never felt more alive
Reborn removed the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down but now I'm back up
Bout to act up boy you better back up
When you see me set up shop know to pack up
I crack up when a rapper gets slapped up
Number one reason yall should give rap up
Dice it's mine, I got it all wrapped up
I'm kinda W.E.B. Dubois meets Heavy D and the boys smooth as a Rolls Royce
Built like a tank smoking on dank
I'm walking through the Guggenheim Raw Life Black Ink

Southside get busy yall
Northside get busy yall
Westside get busy yall
Worldwide get busy yall

Now on your mark get set
Go cop everything you ever heard by P.Crack Dice Raw and Black
Fuck the internet buy a baseball bat break a bootlegger
Leg all I listen to is vets, your fresh of the step
I come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the one two check not the one two step
Um strapped I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now lets go! you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show I start it with a can I get a ho and the hoes go retarded
The popo tape off the stage for caution, its badlands north philly get it in!
Its crack man, used to backspin now I spend stacks in sack's and
Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard earned raps damn!
We makin' yin, pesos, euros, we representin'

Northside get busy yall

I'm comin' for clothes, these hoes, we goin' through it
Pull out my gat, she though I was goin' shoot her

My mind in the gutter, and my heart in the sewer

I don't give em shit, and they keep comin' back to it

Right here on daddy legs, now hush, take a sip of the brown
Lap dance on it, leave a white stain on my Levis

Through a lasso over your hips, rustle your mean thighs
You bow-legged too? I'm a hit it from all sides
Uh huh, we brought the bar, you bought the bar
Beans got the big lighter out, waiting to spark
Word up, dance floors, noise, asses shaking
And she winding that body like she got Jamaican
Asians, sistas, blacks, bad Caucasians
Get em all Goosed up, then I persuade them

Fresh new trick to flip--I'm Dick Dastard
Half smooth criminal and half straight bastard
No mask when your flag get captured
First class, take you to the rap hereafter
Gone in a flash and yet he gets faster
Sick when he hits the mic like Mix-master
This the Battle of Troy with no Pastor
Slicker than a can of oil with no Castor
Chill in the front of the flight, outclass them
Bring your favorite rapper to fight, I'll trash him

Waiting on a big payback with no taxes
So if you follow the game, you might catch this
Act like an activist--you know, active
Nigga like me just has to spit acid
Sucker like you just has to get blasted
Ashes to ashes, Frasier to Cassius
No homo--y'all some pains in the asses
Get turned to toast like raising your glasses

Often nasty like Monster Mashing
Y'all know the voice is tight, hoarse, and raspy
Can't place the face, kind of hard to catch me

Caught like a felony, you can't slide past me

Smooth Remy, tool skinny, but hold plenty
.22 long contact, new Bentley
No miles yet, curve backs and cruise and he
Bring it back when you through with it, roger that
Grip tenny, French mammies in Vic' panties
Lips candy, dick hard as a fifth of brandy
Hop in it for five minutes; then I'm finished
'Cause pussy is pleasure, but I'm attending my business
Retractable roof, magical coupe disappearing
And reappearing; German engineering this McLaren
Hot jacuzzis, watching movies, glock and Uzis

That I was a country clown

I heard somebody call me
It was a policeman on his beat
I heard somebody call me
It was a policeman on his beat

Well, well, now he just wanted to tell me
Ohh, well, well
That I was drivin' on the wrong
Side of the street

Folks, I'll keep on tellin' you
That I'm just so crazy with the blues

Play it just a little bit boys, that's good

Folks, I just keep on tellin' you
I'm just a crazy with the blues
I'm goin' to the railroad down to the river
Woo, well, but I don't know
Which one that I will choose

Ocultos tras los rincones

Dime si no hay otra salida
Si es que tu y yo
Nunca podremos escapar

Si ellos no me dan una alternativa
Yo tendré que actuar
Tenme fe y veras

Puedo fingir como un payaso sin alma
Puedo vagar como un fantasma
Y aunque no pueda acariciar tu espalda
Yo puedo cambiar de color
Puedo ser como un camaleón y no decirles de este amor

Este secreto tan secreto es mi mayor devoción
Pesa más que la luna y quema como el sol
Dime si sientes lo que siento si no merezco tu amor
Dime si aun no es tiempo y callar es mejor

Disimular todo lo que siento por ti
Con miedo de no ser perfecto para ti
Dame una esperanza o si no me convertiré
En un camaleón sin fe

Dime si la luz es muy tenue si al gritar
Ya nadie te puede escuchar
Yo me convertiré en un superhéroe

El amor es tan extraño no lo puedo entender
Porque a veces hace daño pero a veces hace bien
Si lo buscas, el se esconde en algún lugar
Pero él a mi me va a encontrar

Como será, cuando vendrás
Me harás reír, me harás llorar
Cuando te vea el corazón me lo dirá

El amor es una estrella tan difícil de alcanzar
Sin un beso que me pueda hacer volar
Es como un rompecabezas que me cuesta tanto armar

El dolor de una ilusión perdida

Yo he aguantado en sangre fría
Las sorpresas de la vida
Yo moría hasta que oí
Una voz desde el cielo que decía

Irvine, levántate del suelo
Te ofrezco estos pergaminos
Son 10 and son unos consejos
Pa' que el que este deprimido

Oye todo lo que digan
Piensa and no digas nada
Ríe and respira alegría
No te deprimas por nada

Tienes que alzar la mirada
And no decir mentiras
Vive la vida and camina
Grita cada mañana

Ay que perdonar aquel que te falla
Tú verás que el que la hace la paga
Tú verás camarada, tú verás camarada

Tan frustrado and sin consuelo
Yo tenía tanto and tanto miedo

De intentar de nuevo
Enterrado bajo hielo
Con ceniza el cenicero

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,2002
Peg Clancy,"[Chorus]
I'll tell me Ma when I go home, 
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb 
But that's all right till I get home
 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast City
She is a-courtin' one, two, three, please won't you tell me who is she?
Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her
They knock on the door, they ring on the bell, say ""Oh my true love are you well?""
Out she comes as white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Oul Johnny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the rovin' eye

[Chorus]

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high and the snow come tumblin' from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie and she'll get her own lad bye and bye

Let them all come as they will, it's Albert Mooney she loves still

And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home

From which I'll never roam,

""Come on you lazy bum now get your butt out of bed""

And then I saw this angel boppin' down the street
I said, ""Hey, pretty baby, hows about a date?""
She said, ""I'm going to school and I can't be late""

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

On a hilltop high, you and I, 
Shiny and new, a cottage that two can fill. 
And we'll be pleased to be called 
""The folks who live on the hill."" 

Someday we may be adding 
A thing or two, a wing or two. 
We will make changes as any family will. 
But we will always be called 
""The folks who live on the hill."" 

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green, 
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen. 
And when the kids grow up and leave us, 
We'll sit and look at the same old view, just we two.

The crops ain't gonna fail
Caught a blue bird by the toe
A rainbow by the tail
A certain man with eyes that shine
Voodooed up this heart of mine

It seems like
Happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they see little Joe passing by
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
But when he kisses me it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy

Does he love me good?
That's all I need to know

Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe

The news that's going round?
The shamrock is forbid by law
To grow on Irish ground!
St. Patrick's Day no more we'll keep,
His color can't be seen,
For there's a bloomin' law agin'
The wearing of the green.
I met with Napper Tandy
And he took me by the hand,
And he said, ""How's poor old Ireland
And how does she stand?""
""She's the most distressful country
That ever yet was seen;
They're hanging men and women there
For wearing of the green.""

Then since the color we must wear
Is England's cruel red,
Sure Ireland's songs will ne'er forget
The blood that they have shed.
You may take the shamrock from your hat now,
Cast it on the sod,
But 'twill take root and flourish still,
Tho' under foot it's trod.
When the law can stop the blades of green
From growing as they grow,
And when the leaves in summertime
Their verdue dare not show,
Then I will change the color that I
Wear in my canteen;

Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise
Hey there, you on that high flying cloud
Tho' she won't throw a crumb to you
You think some day she'll come to you
Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care
Won't you take this advice

Or are you not seeing things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other.",Hey There [From The Pajama Game],1960

Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
Why this elation mixed with deflation?

Just hit by a thunderbolt, I am in love

I'm a girl and by me that's only great
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy
that I walk with a sweet and girlish gait
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervey

I adore being dressed in something frilly
When my date comes to get me at my place
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy
Like a filly who is ready for the race

When I have a brand new hairdo
With my eyelashes all in curls
I float as the clouds on air do
I enjoy being a girl

And my teeth aren't teeth but pearls
I just lap it up like honey

I flip when a fellow sends me flowers
I drool over dresses made of lace
I talk on the telephone for hours
with a pound and a half of cream upon my face

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
who'll enjoy being a guy, having a girl like me

When men say I'm sweet as candy
As around in a dance we whirl
It goes to my head like brandy
I enjoy being a girl

With someone with eyes that smolder
Says he loves every silken curl
That falls on my ivory shoulder
I enjoy being a girl

When I hear a complementary whistle 
That greets my bikini by the sea
I turn and I glower and I gristle
But I'm happy to know the whistles meant for me

Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin

Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you

On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?

And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you

Peggy Lee,"Oh the tango is done with a thin black moustache, 
a wide scarlet sash, black boots and a whip
Or the tango is done with seafaring trash, 
callous and brash, fresh off the ship
Or the tango is done as a dangerous dance, 
a treacherous step and if one should trip
The frail body breaks with a snap and a twist, 
And a gold watch slips onto a thick tattooed wrist
And a gray merchant ship turns black in the sun, 
as it heaves to the East when the tango is done.

Butterflies mounted on fields of black velvet
Neatly arranged in gleaming glass trays
One-eyed Etruscans play follow-the-leader
Forever around the edge of the vase

The phonograph's playing an old broken record
A tango and over and over it plays
Over it plays
Over it plays

A medieval tapestry hangs like a warning,
A needlepoint forest of dark green and brown.
The scene is the hunt, you will notice the hunter.
He takes careful aim as your eye travels down,

And finally rests upon the real victim,
Lying quite still in a silk dressing gown.
Lying quite still at the edge of the carpet.
One arm flung out for the peacocks to peck.
Blending in well with the blue and green background
Except for the bright scarlet sash round the neck

He was a collector of beautiful strangers
And life was a party right up to the end
The door always opened to love and loves dangers
Though dead, a lover, a stranger, a friend

Peggy Lee,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Peggy Lee,"I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up
In his arms and raced through the burning building out to the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself, is that all there is to a fire?

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And when I was twelve years old, my father took me to a circus, the greatest show on earth
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what, but when it was over
I said to myself, ""is that all there is to the circus?

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take take long walks down by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
And then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't I said to myself, is that all there is to love?

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep

I know what you must be saying to yourselves
If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?
Oh, no, not me I'm not ready for that final disappointment
'Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
When that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball

But was a woman born to weep and fret 
To stay at home and tend her oven 
And down her past regrets 
In coffee and cigarettes

Moanin' all the night

Dressed in tattered dreams of good-bye grey?
Lost, with nothing more to lose,
She carries a bouquet of blues.

And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,

Promise you'll always continue to be mine

But practically everything leaves me totally cold.
The exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree,
Fighting vainly the old ennui,
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face.

I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some, they may go for cocaine.
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too.
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me.

I get no kick in a plane.
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do.

Whoever would have doubted those innocent eyes
And all the little kisses that you made me believe

Each temptation that lures us along

Others drill a hole-and then do it,

Probably we'll live to see machines do it,

In the desert Wilbur Clark does it

An old cow polk went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A plowin' through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Yippee-I-yay, yippee-I-yo
The ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

(Yippee-I-yay) yippee-I-yay (yippee-I-yay, yippee-I-yo

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
'If you want to save your soul from hell aridin' on our range

He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh

But when he kisses me it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy

Does he love me good?
That's all I need to know

Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe

I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up 
in his arms and raced through the burning building out to the pavement. 
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames. 
And when it was all over I said to myself, ""Is that all there is to a fire""

And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to a circus, the greatest show on earth. 
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears. 
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads. 
And so I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle. 
I had the feeling that something was missing. 
I don't know what, but when it was over, 
I said to myself, ""is that all there is to a circus?

Then I fell in love, head over heels in love, with the most wonderful boy in the world. 
We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. 
We were so very much in love. 
Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't, 
and when I didn't I said to myself, ""is that all there is to love?""

Monroe may not have sung it precisely this way  but a recording by him was not 
available so the words and music herein are taken from the sheet music as written 
by Stan Jones 
Monroes' version, as well as competing versions by Peggy Lee (# 2), Bing Crosby 
(#14), and Burl Ives (# 21) were all charted as just ""Riders In the Sky""
Later, The Ramrods took it to # 30 in 1961 with the parenthetical (Ghost) added, 
as did the Baja Marimba Band (#52 in 1966) and The Outlaws (#31 in 1981)
Lawrence Welk used the original title on his # 87 in 1961.


An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

Peggy Lee,"When skies are cloudy and gray, 
They're only gray for a day, 
So wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away. 
Until that sunshine peeps through, 
There's only one thing to do, 
Just wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away. 

Your castles may tumble, 
That's Fate after all, 
Life's really funny that way. 
No use to grumble, 
Just smile as they fall, 
Weren't you King for a day?

Always follows the rain, 
So wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away.",Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams,2001
Peggy Lee,"In the spring when the feeling was chronic
And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.

When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother
And so I loved my horse.
But horses are frequently silly-
Mine ran from the beach of Kailua
And left me alone for a filly,
So I-a picked you-a.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:

Finding another world.

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life

Peggy Lee,"Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
Through the fields we go 
Laughing all the way. 
Bells on bob-tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight.

Chorus: 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way, 
Oh what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh, O 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way, 
Oh what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
A day or two ago 
I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
Was seated by my side; 
The horse was lean and lank 
Misfortune seemed his lot, 
We ran into a drifted bank 
And there we got upsot. 
A day or two ago 
The story I must tell 
I went out on the snow 
And on my back I fell; 
A gent was riding by 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed at me as 
I there sprawling laid 
But quickly drove away. 
Now the ground is white, 
Go it while you're young, 
Take the girls along 
And sing this sleighing song. 
Just bet a bob-tailed bay, 
Two-forty as his speed, 
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! 
You'll take the lead.",I Like a Sleigh Ride,2006
Peggy Lee,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows, a turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Peggy Lee,"Mr. Irving Berlin
Often emphasizes sin
In a charming way.
Mr. Coward we know
Wrote a song or two to show
Sex was here to stay.
Richard Rodgers it's true
Took a more romantic view
Of this sly biological urge.
But it really was Cole
Who contrived to make the whole
Thing merge.

He said the Belgians and Greeks do it
Nice young men who sell antiques do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Monkeys whenever you look do it,
Aly Khan and King Farouk do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Louella Parsons can't quite do it,
For she's so highly strung,
Marlene might do it,
But she looks far too young.
Each man out there shooting crap does it,
Davy Crockett in that dreadful cap does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Our famous writers in swarms do it,
Somerset and all the Maughams do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
The Brontes felt that they must do it,
Ernest Hemingway could-just-do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
E. Allan Poe-ho! ho! ho!-did it,
But he did it in verse.
H. Beecher Stowe did it,
But she had to rehearse.
Tennessee Williams self-taught does it,
Kinsey with a deafening report does it.
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

In the Spring of the year
Inhibitions disappear
And our hearts beat high,
We had better face facts
Every gland that overacts
Has an alibi
For each bird and each bee,
Each slap-happy sappy tree,
Each temptation that lures us along
Is just Nature elle-meme
Merely singing us the same
Old song.

In Texas some of the men do it
Others drill a hole-and then do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love
West Point cadets forming fours do it,
People say all those Gabors do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
My kith and kin, more or less, do it,
Every uncle and aunt,
But I confess to it
I've one cousin that can't.
Teenagers squeezed into jeans do it,
Probably we'll live to see machines do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Each baby bat after dark does it,
In the desert Wilbur Clark does it
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
We're told that every hormone does it,
Victor Borge all alone does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Each tiny clam you consume does it,
Even Liberace-we assume-does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love!",Let's Do It,2006

I never maybe my sugar
That's why my baby is so confectionery

Funny, he never asks for my money
All I can give him is honey that he can get anytime

I'd make a million trips to his lips if I was a bee
'Cause they are sweeter than any candy to me

As granulated sugar I never cheat on my sugar
'Cause I'm too sweet on my sugar

Sweet as a honey
Suck a roaster in it up

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And I knew the spark of love was still burning

For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I may be lifeless,
But wid one wife less
Mah life would be mo' strifeless,
Yes siree!
No matter what you say
Ah still suits me.

Does you ever wash de dishes?
Does you do de things ah wishes?
Does you do dem?
No you don't!
Will you do dem?
No, you won't!

Always imitatin' me
An' always aggravation' me!
Den in spite of ev'rything,
'Spite of all de grief you bring,
'Xpectin' me to love you true!

No matter what you say,
Ah thinks you do.

Peggy Lee,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
A fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
A fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou giveth fever, when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said ""daddy oh don't you dare""
""He givess me fever with his kisses""
""Fever when he holds me tight""
""Fever, I'm his misses""
""Daddy won't you treat him right?""

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever [Cover],2008
Peggy Lee,"There's a famous thoroughfare
I've heard collegiates say
I'm not referring to Piccadilly
It's not 42nd Street

It's not the rue de la Paix
Nor is it Market Street in Philly
Ask most any college Romeo
To complete your education you must go....

Down the old ox road
Though you'll never find where it is 
By looking in maps
With a little investigation you'll discover perhaps

That this old tradition's not a place 
But just a proposition called
The old ox road
The old ox road

Ox road could be any romantic spot
A country highway or a moonlit yacht
It could be in the parlor
When the lights are burning low

It could be in the movie 
In the very last row

Down the old ox road
In the magic of the moonlight 
You are filled with delight
While the leaves that flutter o'er you 

Whisper lover tonight
Why keep waiting, and debating
When you know it's time for mating 

On the old ox road
On the old ox road",Down the Old Ox Road,2008
Peggy Lee,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah",The Long and Winding Road,2008
Peggy Lee,"You, you're driving me crazy! 
What did I do? What did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy, 
Clouding the skies of blue
How true, were the friends who were near me to cheer me
Believe, me they knew, but you
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me
When I needed you
Yes you, you're driving me crazy! 
What did I do to you?",You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?) [#][*],2008
