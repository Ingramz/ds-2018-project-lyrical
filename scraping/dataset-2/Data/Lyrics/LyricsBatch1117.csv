Blue again
And you know darn well
It's you again
You said last night
We were through again
And now, I'm blue again

I'm alone again
Alone again
I'm out around on my own again
There's a mockingbird that's flown again
And I'm alone again

Now baby, though I said I hate you
I love you more every day, babe
Though I aggravate you
All that I'm dying to say
Is that it's new again
You again
And we'll meet today at half past two again
And tonight, we'll fight
Again
And I'll be blue again",Blue Again,2006

Benson Orchestra of Chicago,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.

I shall holler for assistance,

Their words are ugly sounds
But I resist all their attempts
To try and bring me down..
Turned on to the sunset,
Like I've never done before.
And I listen for your footsteps
And your know upon the door.

And it's love you bring,
With dreams of bluer skies
All these things,
When I seem them in your eyes

Did you ever laugh at Hermon
Darling would you please stop squirming

Have you ever lost your senses
How's about those senior (wenches)

Don't turn me on, don't turn me off
Don't tie me up, just tie me down

Have you ever lost your reason

Bent Fabric,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Bent Fabric,"Who's that coming down the street?
Good old organ grinder Pete
He's the latest rhythm king
With his organ grinder's swing

Dadya, you swing it, so do I
Dadya, I swing it so do you
 
When he turns that handle down
Music goes around and 'round

To that organ grinder's swing

The thing that you'll never never possess

But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try

Bent Persson,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you, just the way you look tonight.

But the blisters on my skin they tell me different
Bad dreams-sugarcoated tabs from hell

Stone cold sweat
I bleed to death every night
Something here ain't exactly right
Someone turn the wheel before I drown
Beneath your mountain

Oh, it's so strange
Sometimes I see these things
That don't exist
Beyond my dreams
Wake up,with nerves sprayed on the wall

Empty-too full of fear to fill up
Too far gone to stop, too scared to move

Benton Paul,"Just got back from Paris France
All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy

Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French

Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris

Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire

Bentzon Brotherhood,"I said a hip hop,
Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
The purple and yellow  But first, I gotta
Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn

Fueron tus ojos o tu boca
Fueron tus manos o tu voz
Fue a lo mejor la impaciencia
De tanto esperar tu llegada

It's a thrill to me that you niggas want to kill me
I think you all know this saga
They mad cause they wish they had the shit that I had
I'm fucking there babies moma
My soldiers salute with their guns high
Aim and they'll shoot you with one try
I never understood why, niggas snitch and bitches lie
How a motherfucker gonna testify
When he's doing the same shit that I'm doing?
Yap to the feds for a little bit of bread
Now The whole fucking game is ruined
A lot of these niggas are two faced
They need to use glue for they tooth paste
They better strap up or get their boots laced
Or get victim of a 44 shell case
Your bitch said she like the way my dick taste
Now the hoe back up in your face
To the rules of the game you're a disgrace
Never trust no bitch in the first place
Me and Big Sco came to blast these hoes'
Who can't keep shit on the hush
When we come, guns bust
Ruckus hit the dust, it's only us

Chorus:

(Big Sco)
These niggas want drama?
Who the fuck these busta testing
Bout to teach em a lesson, when I get to blesson
Wit the motherfucking smith & wesson
No question let me make one suggestion
Don't fuck around with a nigga that you can't fuck with
Cause I buck quick what's wrong dog?
You mad at me cause your bitch suck dick
Just duck quick cause when I let that thing off
When I break it off ring it off it's over with
Busting nuts I'm all over the shoulder shit
You can't fuck with a nigga y'all know this shit is on
Some popo shit but when it comes to me I don't know no shit
You got to go bitch gotta find a big ditch for a bitch snitch
Hit the nigga with 6 in the mix
Ima fix the mother fucker cause he a big bitch
Swiftly hit the nigga with the fifty caliber
Challenger, I'm a damage ya, you a amateur
I got stamina, kill a nigga put it on camera
Fuck around I'll have to handle ya, dismantle ya, ha
This what I do to a enemy
Split a motherfuckers head like Kennedy
Fuck y'all, don't you know its ten of me
So don't pretend to be no friend to me
Big guns those things are like kin to me
Simply I bust and the ones I can't touch
Well put it like this, them bitches get fucked, my dick get sucked
y'all can't fuck with us
Listen you don't want to bang with me hang with me

Yo I'd like to introduce to you two very special women in my life.
Let me tell you bout this girl I know I met her in four corners in Boston some
Years ago since we first made contact I knew it was right yeah and the girl
Been in my life ever since that night her body was tight I'm tellin you dawg I
Had to get her remember like it's yesterday the day that I met her she was
Rollin with Jamaicans but on the really she told me she was raised in the
Hearts of Philly city of brotherly love was from the hood used to run the back
Woods with thugs who sold drugs her friends they used to flirt I considered
Them garbage while she was bein chased by every nigga in college used to date
Some clown from up north he used to choke her but I would never treat her like
That cause she's a smoker one of a kind honey's a dime with no seeds I ain't
Gon never let her go cause she's all I need indeed

Chorus: (She's a different kind of lady...)
She's a a dif-different kind of lady and she will never hurt you she'll never
Desert you she'll be the one to hold ya down repeat

[Benzino]:
Man there's just somethin about her (love) that I swear sometimes I can't make
It through a whole day without her some say our relationship is not that strong
They said it's just a phase won't last that long Jeff said I was wrong to fall
In love cause she was passed around I don't care she with me right now I'm so
Attracted to her vibe she got me open so wide and you can tell by the glow in
My eyes it's hard to sleep without her by my bed at night with her on my side
I'm gon be alright I love to hold her squeeze her don't let go she's my heat in
The winter when the weather is cold see anytime there's drama she gon come in a
Hurry not jealous if she see me with my main girl Mary she gon go to war with
Me hit the floor with me if I go on a caper she gon keep in the door with me I
Was smokin quick to put a nigga on blast only person that I tell where I hide
The cash she's a gangsta bitch she don't give a fuck drive-bys stick her head
Out the window push puff blow smoke out her nose it's a must a propose cause I
Love her don't give a fuck who knows she's the Bonnie to my Clyde the Tina to
My Ike her name is Nina I love her for the rest of my life

No margin for error no room for slack

Lyin tryin to convict me
They wait to treat a nigga you would think it was the 60's

Makes you wanna holla
To the top of my lungs but the weed smoke's blockin my lungs

See what I've seen takin puffs off the green

Everywhere you turn cameras all up in your face
I.R.S. audit your papes trying to take your estate
And your man's on the stand raisin his right hand
Cause you swear to tell the truth I bet you do
And it

Makes you wanna holla
Cause when you got dollars every chick wanna holla
Claimin they swallow
Need the so-called cats you knew from way back
Suddenly they your cousin wanna run with the pack
He your man long as you givin him stacks
But let you get fucked and need a buck

Must be crazy, ay yo Sin, what's up Capone?

[Verse 1]
Let me start from the beginnin, you ain't reppin the streets
You from the outskirts of Detroit, where the bitches meet
I'm gonna pull your skirt up, expose your true sex
Antagonize your label, till I get my respect
You ran to your manager, asked him how to handle this
Five shades darker motherfucker you'll be Canibus
No one would care about your complicated rhyme style
Another backpack rapper out of style
Don't let me have to backslap your mom's if you smile
I'm serious, if you ain't 'gon respect her why should I?
Chin check it Snoopy put a circle on that eye
My time's never up cause real niggas don't die
I'm not Moby, the little puppet on MTV
I bring glasses to your living room so you could see me
Yeah you sold a lot of units, but you can't be me
The state of hip hop, will continue to be fucked up
You playin by a different set of rules you got me fucked up
Respect the hood Marshall, or the hood'll take you out
You the real wanksta, and I don't care who you sign
Disrespect Benzino, that ass is mine
What you know about pumpin, on the block till you freeze
What you know about cuttin up rocks, duckin D's
What you know about facin, a grand jury indictment
As far as I'm concerned you just industry excitement
I hope them D12 niggas ain't who you fight with
Clash with the titan, you bound to start a crisis
Meanwhile back in Boston I'm a legend

The two thousand three Vanilla Ice how you playin it
If you ask me, you really ain't that nice you overrated
Hang you from your feet part two in theaters now
Drop your ass from the roof you gonna feel it now
You was unsigned hype, before you ever met Dre
I birthed your little career now you owe your life to Ray
The five mic giver, the Marshall maggot ripper
Better never let me see you with some jewels I'm gonna strip ya
Oh, and tell your label heads stop callin my phone (Jimmy)
Leavin messages sayin please leave him alone (Fuck that!!!)
And don't forget, how this shit all cccured to me
Your whole camp be surrounded by security
What you want? the black or the chrome?
How can you ever claim a block, when you have no home
I do it for my niggas in the cells and public housin
You takin too much X Em you need counselin
Get anybody on your roster who could fuck with Ray
Obie Trice you a busta I don't think you want to play
And 50 holla at your boy get that loot and ride
But please don't make the mistake and take this nigga's side
I hate to have to turn this battle to an all in out war
But if we have to, I'm a leave his partners on the floor
I think we both know exactly what we hear for
I want the streets back I'm comin to your door
I earn my stripes I'm a don you a pussy
Zino bombs hit you out the park you still a rookie
Bottom of the ninth, the scores lookin crazy
Niggas on my block will knock Slim Shady

He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)
He's alright but he's not real (Real)

Speakin' in tongue

I'm on a one way trip to death
Inhaling this pain like it's my last breath (so what's next)
I'm a kill you 'fore you kill me
Fuckin' with Hobby ya dead body
Your bitch gonna feel me

Hussein the don
It's nothin I get there early
'Cause I stay in the mix
Could you imagine all the demons

When you stay in the Bricks
And every night I hear em talkin to me
It's like I hear em when they call me in my sleep
But I ain't tryin ta feel em walkin to me

Six million ways to die
I choose the one, that's easiest to me
So I choose the gun
And if you choose the wrong one choice

you better choose to run
I had a soul of Makaveli
When you lose a lung
Take it from me

I make niggas learn respect
Disrespect hurt but pain is when I burn a tech
And it ain't nutttin like gettin ya head slittin ya wig
And the fed find you buried with your bitch and her kids

It was rough comin up nigga, I ain't eatin
You think I'm tryin to turn the tables now, I ain't beat

I'm finna do this, ride it out to the end
Rest In Peace to my niggas

Let's talk about it

[Benzino]
Would you love me if I fell on hard times?
Lost everything, down to a dime?
Would you, let me fuck if I didn't stack cheese?
Didn't see my face on BET?

Would you, stop for me, if I wasn't on dubs?
Didn't buy the bar when I walk through the club?
Would you, let me slide if I wasn't so live?
Average joe working nine to five?

Would you still want to ride? 
Still want to freak if the ice wasn't bright in the masterpiece?
If you didn't lose sight when I flashed the three
Would you still be shakin that ass for me?

Would you, creek, let me run in it?
Kiss the first night, take it to the limit?
If I had to go to jail would you hold it down?
If not, shit I'ma leave ya now, I need to know

[Chorus: Mario Winans w/ ad libs]
I gotta know, baby
Would you be right here beside me when I'm gone

If I wasn't on the screen, would you still fiend?
And would I still be your dream? 
If I didn't gleam on my own 

Would you still be in that zone?
Would you never leave me alone?
If I was a Reebok hood rat would you still book that flight 
Outta town, if I didn't stay laced? 

Couldn't cook would you still be in my life?

Yo, throw your 3's up

Lord I'm crying out, help me get my shit together
They tryin to put me back in, but I won't let 'em
I'm a living legend in these streets - east coast gangsta
With ties to the west coast, banging
Motherfuck a street team, my team bereave streets
Since '86 street sweepers poppin out the back door
Sprayed blocks, certain niggas kept glocks
Trucks ramped, niggas couldn't understand it
Benzino, sniffin eighths of anthrax
Niggas can't touch me, my nose gettin runny
I got 5 cases, in 3 states with 6 lawyers
Had a 5S with Mass plates and 4 corners
Now I'm Black Stallion, Ferrari Twin Turbo
Probably been warned, but 'Zino gon hurt you
Enough's enough, let's take it to the streets
Raise big fire over Hangmen beats, c'mon

Go hard, or go home - I don't want to hear it
My shit too long, and now you gon feel it

On the streets of St. Augustine

Well they burned down the town in the name of a king
Divided it up for diamonds and rings
Now they're telling the singers there's no place to sing
On the streets of St. Augustine

Hey, hey, hey, hey

And Fred well he's down from Nova Scotia again
He's sailing the seas on the palm of the wind
And he's going off to Cuba that Canadian
From the streets of St. Augustine

And you can run from the pocket of a comfortable hand
Put your soul in a suitcase and travel the land
And count yourself lucky if you finally stand
On the streets of St. Augustine

Well you tell me you love me and I'm all right
Simple as that like the tail of a kite
I close my eyes and we're walking tonight
On the streets of St. Augustine

Berard,"Dans la campagne verdoyante,
Le train longeant sa voie de fer
Emporte une foule bruyante, 
Tout là-bas vers la grande mer,
Le mécanicien Jean, 
Sur sa locomotive,
Regarde l'air mauvais Blaise le beau chauffeur
La colère en ses yeux luit d'une flamme vive 
De sa femme chérie Blaise a volé le coeur 
Roule, roule, train du plaisir, 
Dans la plaine jolie,
Vers un bel avenir d'amour et de folie,
L'homme rude et noir 
Qui conduit cette joyeuse foule
Sent de ses yeux rougis une larme qui coule
Des heureux voyageurs, 
On entend les refrains
Suivant les rails et son destin
C'est le train du plaisir qui roule.

Le pauvre Jean, perdant la tête, 
Rendu par la trahison
Sur son rival soudain se jette criant :
""Bandit, rends-moi Lison"",
Le chauffeur éperdu fait tournoyer sa pelle
Jean lui sautant au cou
L'étrangle comme un chien
Et tous les deux
Rivés par l'étreinte mortelle
Tombent de la machine
Abandonnant leur train
Roule, roule, train du malheur
Dans la plaine assombrie
Roule à toute vapeur d'un élan de folie
Les paysans saisis le voyant 
tout seul fendant l'espace
Se signent en priant
Et la terreur les glace,
Des heureux voyageurs
On entend les refrains
Suivant son terrible destin 
C'est le train du malheur qui passe.

Tiens, la chose est vraiment bizarre,
On devait s'arrêter ici
Le train brûle encore une gare, 
Ah! ça... que veut dire ceci ?
Alors du train maudit une clameur s'élève
On entend des sanglots
Et des cris de dément
Chacun revoit sa vie dans un rapide rêve
Puis c'est le choc, le feu,
Les appels déchirants !
Flambe, flambe,
Train de la mort dans la plaine rougie
Tout se brise et se tord sous un vent de folie
Les petits enfants, leurs mamans,
S'appellent dans les flammes,
Les amoureux râlent réunissent leurs âmes !
Pourquoi ces pleurs, ces cris, 
Pourquoi ces orphelins ?
Pour un simple, un tout petit rien :
L'infidélité d'une femme.",Le Train Fatal [1920],2001

Makes you smile and sing
The joy you share no kid in candy land
Or fun world can compare
Don't tell me it's not meant to be
Just you and me for eternity
And maybe you have a different view
But I don't want you to go
'Cause you are all that I know
And I know 

[Chorus...]",Good Love,1996
Beres Hammond,"Dream Warriors Intro... 
Beres
Did I wake you too sudden baby
Did I take you out of your slumber
Did I disturb your sweetest dreams
It's just a lovers game
I just had to do it baby trust me
I love to watch you sleeping
To see that everything was right
Oh but I felt this passion coming over
Over and over and over
And I just got to let you know 

[Chorus]
It's been a long day
We're both tired from working hard
We're almost forgetting to play
This is all I want to say
Just to remind you that
We're missing the highlight of the day 

Now that you're almost wide awake
I'm willing and ready for the take
This is where the cookie crumbles
Whether a single or a double
I'd settle for whatever
Honey let me melt in your arms
Hold me even when the clock alarms
Take the phone off the hook
Kill me with that dirty look
Let me sign in your book 

[Chorus..]",Highlight of the Day,1996
Beres Hammond,"Love is the connection
That join two people together
What a sweet connection
When it's right it will last forever
But if you give it a try
And you can't get a vibes
Take my advice
If your heart's not in it let it go 

[Chorus]
Stop wasting time
Don't fool yourself it won't grow
Now if you heart's not in it let it go
Stop wasting time, don't fool yourself It won't grow 

It's not like a game
Where you loose today
And win tomorrow
Use up your brain
You don't want your world
To tumble over
Don't you rush in
Cause you'll never win
Take my advice
If your hearts not in it let it go 

[Chorus...]",Let It Go,1996
Beres Hammond,"[Chorus]
I see love from a distance
Coming but slowly
I know it's gonna last forever
I feel us coming closer, closer and closer
It's the time we get together 

I know you done a lot of wrongs
But I'm willing to forgive
No one has the right to decide
How the other man should live
Sometimes we should stop and count to ten
Before we make each other hurt
'Cause later on you realize
It really had no worth 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
Mama she's taught us for so long
With the right, the fool we teach
And the wisdom in her eyes
Kept me safe through all the years
Made me grow to understand
That there's still good folks around
And to keep this in your hearts
Just to be on solid ground 

[Chorus...]",Love from a Distance,1996
Beres Hammond,"Yeah baby we've been through so much
Much have been said, about you and me baby
I think it's time to prove them wrong now
All that love and all of that affection now
Can't you see that we've got it going on 

[Chorus]
But if you could give in ya baby
To all that careless whisper
You would be drowning in pain
Deep in pain deeper and deeper
You'll be hurting especially at night
And I'll be sorry we couldn't get it right
We'll be lonely living two separate lives
Don't make it too long before we realize 

A fish for you girl and a little one for me baby
That's how I think it should always be
But folks around they don't seem
To like a good living no so with their tricks
They try to come between 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
But if you should say yes
To every time they complain
Your poor heart could know
The measure of pain
You'll be hurting especially at night
And I'll be sorry we couldn't make it right
We'll be lonely living two separate lives
Don't make it too long before we realize
Don't listen to words that they got to say
They are lies they are lies
Don't get caught up now 

Oh you got me smoking
Girl you got me thinking
Wondering if you doint the same
I feel a little shaking
Oh I feel a little nervous
I also know you don't want it to end 

[Chorus...]",Much Have Been Said,1996
Beres Hammond,"Do you know what I'd like to do right now
I'd like to lay right down girl
And put my arms around you
Wonder where will I be let's say six years from now
I wish that I could still be with you
Now if I had it in my hand control your every move
Now here is exactly what I'd do 

[Chorus]
I'd put you in the middle of my rose garden
And I would never never have to say pardon
To the daises the tulips the buttercups
Not even the roses and I'd water you first every
Morning the other flowers would have to start
Calling give me some water please
We too need to grow 

Wonder where will I be
Let's say ten years down the road
Search my heart and constantly you're there
Can't get you out of my system and I like this living
It's so wonderful that you and I can share 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
Time will change us never
Nature's gonna keep us together
Time will change us forever
Know our love will last so I shouldn't even ask
Where will I be, will you be there with me
Can't get you out of my system and I like this living
I've searched my heart, it always sets me free
Time will change us never
Nature's gonna keep us together
Time will change us never
Nature's gonna keep us forever

From the bottom of my heart
You had no place for me, it was all vanity now

You fell for one a them sweet lies
The ones you don't want to believe in
When your heart's not hearing
What your brain is saying
And you're weak in the knees
Another sweet lie
The kind you don't want to believe
When the heart's in doubt you got to stay out 

Now the wine and the roses
Stop coming around sometime ago
But you won't admit that so, you pretend
I know it's hard to look your best
Wearing that same old shabby dress
So you stay at home, waiting by the phone 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
Now it gives me no pleasure to say
I told you so, it's been hard to keep it low
Knowing the things I know
Maybe in another place and in another time
Under different circumstances
You will find happiness so I suggest
Don't take foolish chances no

When will you realize?

Every man needs a woman for comfort
Nothing to mix up the brain
So if you ever, ever think for a moment
If you can run this man insane

No ain't gonna waste no more time over you, oh no
When with my life I got better things to do
Ain't gonna waste no more time over you
You must be checks and no one needs me

First, loosen up let’s sit and chat
I hate to see you looking like that
Though I know it isn’t easy

Take a load off your shoulder
Can you do this for me?
Oh oh oh oh
My dear Mary
Don’t do that to yourself
No oh oh
My dear Mary
 
Mary Mary don’t get weary
It’s just a part of a play
You’ll star it up again at the end of the day
After all it’s not so bad, things could be worse
Give me that smile girl, now send him a rose

Beret,"Pensando en ti, destrozándome la mente 
Si hace falta por ti me parto los dientes 
Olvidar el pasado me enseñó 
Que pensar en el futuro es la amargura del presente 

La distancia es un veneno que nos mata 
Y para venenos me quedo con tu mirada 
Algo que me atrae, una droga que me ata 
La heroína que me salva, pero que vuela sin capa 

Y no no no
Me buscó perdida y por eso no me encontró 
Yo sano mis heridas con tu voz 
Qué pena que esté lejos de mi oscura habitación 

Me despierto, pero sigo estando triste 
Me afecta todo, lo sabes, lo viste 
Que me he pasado una eternidad buscando 
La razón para entender por qué te fuiste

Sigo sentado en el banco de este parque 
Oliendo el perfume que dejaste 
Prefiero abrirme para amarte 
Que cerrar mi corazón con alcohol para olvidarte 

Corriendo, corriendo, corriendo 
No me canso de correr, pero huyendo otra vez 
Pisando el suelo rojo yo me desangré 
Solo me queda agacharme y recoger

Yo sé que te quiero, pero no pa’ qué 
Tú sabes que quieres, pero no lo haces 
Lo malo del cero es que no sabe dividirse 
Si no existe una persona que sume también 

Yo sé que toda mi vida la puedo perder solo en una mañana 
Que si no me quedo contigo al final lo que no quedarán son las ganas 
Qué fácil es decir “te quiero” pa’ nada, sólo te daba mis alas 
¿Quién tiene culpa, yo que las daba o tú que nunca valorabas?

Y es que puedo, puedo 
Agarrarme a tus alas y llevarte al cielo 
Pero muero cada vez que te pienso 
Pero sale un ‘pero’ 

Yo sé que te quiero, sé que me quiero 
Pero no vale ni un ‘puedo’ 
Cada vez que somos miedo 
Cada vez que pierde la vida para que seamos fuego 

Mañana no sé qué será, pero mañana 
¿Quién me dirá, quién me dará, quién volverá 
Ya si no hay nada 
Mañana, dime si tú vas a estar en las malas 
Dímelo todo y así yo decido si para ti soy nada

Solo vete donde dé más miedo
Las cosas que no puedes cambiar
Son las mismas que acaban cambiándote luego
Te prometí hacer todo por ti
Pero hacerte feliz yo no puedo
Y si vas a ser alguien sin mí
Por favor, nunca seas aquello que te hicieron

Y ya pasó un día y no te veo
Ya llevamos dos y te pierdo
Si pasas de página, ya no te leo

Lo malo es que tú eres fuego

Hasta que olvides por qué no lo hacías
Olvida todo menos la alegría
Un sin sentido que te diga ""vive"" y me llames ""mi vida""
Dices ""ven"", 
Y no me indicas que por dónde siga
Perdiste el tiempo según tú lo miras
Pero lo bueno nunca va a llegar en seguida

Y ahora que no queda tiempo
Me da por querer decirte
Que tú siempre me has querido como no hago yo
Que lo que duelo no es irse
Sino darse cuenta tarde 
De que sí pude quedarme cuando ella ya no
Si el amor puede con todo
Mi problema siempre ha sido pensar que yo de verdad podré con el amor
Y cómo voy a conocerte
Si siempre viví conmigo, y el que menos se conoce en realidad soy yo

Tan solo por un giro salgo de mis pasos
Ya llevo una vida queriéndote, dando, esperándote
Dándome igual que haga daño
Que me está costando el poder darme cuenta
Que para ti no cuento tanto

What, What
Four Shellies
What, What, What

Four shellies rip through his belly
Blast him right outside of Mike's deli
Dip to the tele
Call my bird up on the celle
Bobby what Bobby lust I walk strange
And talk strange
Long range sniper aims
Swiss cheese your brain
I don't sleep
And don't eat meat
Rest twice a week
Speak without moving my lips
Got fifty pairs of sneaks
Fingerprint proof rubber grips
Hollow tip clips
Eight ounce sip bud nips
We crack private do chips
And clock a bird off the block
Straight away from a flock
Just caught me at the bus stop
Twist the Snapple top
Off, pierced her breast
Kept her hair processed
No panties underneath the dress
Wally ankle bracelet
Polo frames
Her shades had no name
Popocane
I slowed my game
Thick gold chains
Make your eyes flame
Up against the Bodega gate
She stay straight
Perfect figure eight
Shape, couldn't wait
To bust her grape
With the applehead
Legs spread open
Invincible body armor
My scarlet blade will slice the leg
From the Shaolin llama

Wind up in mass
Body cast, its like
Don't start shit
Won't be shit
Allah quick to spot shit
Smash hit
You know the name kid
Don't splash it
Pop a joint and blast it
The shit sound
Hype in your whip
Make you take the car and crash it

Always speak actual
Only deal with natural
One hundred percent
Five percent
Militant in aim
With the intent

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Berkley Hart,"When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me

Caricatures of long ago

Knock on doors and empty halls

I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade

Like ghosts in some forgotten play
Beneath the black and empty sky

With partners chosen by chance
And still sometimes remember

But tomorrows, more of the same
So they reached for tomorrow

I'm alone
Sitting with my empty glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the Metro

You wore white
Smiling as you took my hand
So removed
We spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt
I can see you now
Smiling as I pulled away

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes

You wake to the sound of another day, smile at me
And I hate that I want you
But nobody ever made me feel
Feel the way I do now

I love the music, you play on my heartstrings
I feel you in every way

Hideaway in my arms
Where's the shame
Cry away there's no harm
Lost in a nightmare
Falling through thin air
Faster and faster

I'm here to remind you.
I'm bright as the sun when all your hope is gone.
I will be here beside you.
Stronger then steel when you need someone to lean on.


For you...hey hey hey.

On...when you need someone to lean on.

For you...for you...for you....for you...for you...for you...


When you need someone to lean...on.

Berlin,"The night was young and wet that fateful day
You stepped out of the rain and looked my way
All of my cool disappeared
All I ever wanted was here
Gone is the time and the place
And every other face I've known
My life started the moment you said hello

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost
Now I succumb to you

Your conversation set me up to fall
We're through the door the streets
And over my walls
Your scent filled me deep, made me weak
I wanted you all over me

Gone is the time and a thousand reasons
You're a fantasy
Hearing my whispers turn into my screams

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart

There is nothing i can do

Berlin,"She never sleeps, never laughs, never feels the sun
And when you ask her how she is
Tired and broken
She works alone, eats alone, drinks alone at night
She has a family far away
And she doesn't know them
And every day goes be	  like a silent dream
Behind the same four walls closing off her screams
Captured, inside a trance
And once upon a time she had hopes of her own
But as the tears go by she sinks like a stone
Is there someone somewhere who cares
One day she woke up to a life
Without anyone to hold at night
She looked up to the sky

Take what you want
Release yourself from the past
The world is waiting
Step through the door
Finding a way at last oh-oh

He never cries, never talks of the youth he's lost
And when you ask him what he needs
It's just dignity
'Cause every day he's pulled like a man on string
9 to 9 he's working down on his knees
To feel the children he never sees
One day he turned out the light
Without anyone to hold at night
And when he opened his eyes

The world is waiting 
Take what you want.
Release yourself from the past
The world is waiting
Step through the door 
Finding a way at last oh-oh

Don't look back
There's just one track
The weight on you shoulders
Is only in your mind

Leave the rest behind

Benehmen uns oft daneben wenn wir bloß einen drehen,
ich kann machen was ich will du auch, also kannst du gehen. (Tschüss)
G.B.Z. und A.G.G.R.O Berlin,
hier ist nichts normal hier ist alles übertrieben,
raucht das dickste Gras und werd' alles überfliegen.
Deine Chick du Spast ist das, wo alle drauf liegen,
Frauen mit dickem Arsch, ist das, was echte Kerle Lieben,
ich rappe für Berlin und 3,8,3,1,7.

Ich rapp' für S ich leb' für E, ich kill' für K zum T zum E.
Aggro Berlin Mutterficker, represent den Shit,
hier kommt die Posses der Posses für den Neger Bobby Dick.
Ihr seid Pussys, Pussys ihr seid so niedlich,
ihr geht 8 Tage in den Knast und denkt ihr seid wie ich.
Ich bin Kontrovers, kontro Vers
ich komm' mach ein Kind, was mein Konto erbt.
Ich wieg' 100 Kilo ich spuck' wie ein Panzer,
der Index abonniert meine Hits wie Landser.
Ihr macht alle Schwulenpop, keiner pumpt den Schrott im Block.
Ghetto Kiddies rasten aus und feiern MOK den Hip-Hop Schock.

Meine Stahlhand zerschlägt deinen Kopf,
die Parkbank ist für mich nur ein Stock.
Deine Schrankwand zerreiß' ich wie einen Katalog,
Tony Damager schreit dich an und du bist 
Vorsicht du, ich hab mein Ohr nicht eine Sekunde weg von dir,
ich krieg' alles mit.
Ich weiß du redest Shit soviel wie wenn es regnet,
du gehst jetzt anschaffen soviel wie ein Mercedes.
Mein Rap ist Hardcore und nichts Edles,
doch mein Geschmack ist das teuerste ich nehm' es.
Tony D zerstört jedes Ziel
ohne ihn,
wär' Berlin (nein), nicht so aggressiv.

Mein Penis, mein Penis ist dick,
komm' wenn du willst dann wirst du gefickt. 
Ganz Deutschland findet mich zu strange,
meine Tapes haben Strassenfame.
Rap top, Laptop, My Space.com,
schreib' mich an und kauf' 'nen Song.
E-Mail, mein Geschäft das boomt,
warum chillen, es gibt viel zu tun.
Fotzen ficken und Scheine zählen,
daraus besteht mein ganzes Leben.
A.doppel G.R.O Berlin und Berlin Crime, sind ein Team.

Ich bin der Rapper im Spiel,
vor dem ihr Optik kriegt.
jetzt wird dein Kopf gefickt,
G-Hot und Bobby Dick.
Ich krieg' jetzt tausende Anrufe, weil ich viel Geld mache,
mein Handy klingelt jetzt öfters als Bill Gates Kasse.
Die Frauen lieben mich wie Kobe Bryant.
Jetzt ist jeder nett jeder will mein Homie sein.
Dich fässt keine Bitch an dich findet jede Ranz,
du hast kein Sex du hast nur ein Spinnwebenschwanz.
Mit mir will jede Ficken,
wegen meinen bösen Blicken
Sie sind krank nach mir und kriegen wie Vögelgrippe.
Sie wollen morgens meine Eier und mittags meine Wurst,
ich bin ein Star und heb' ab wie ein heisser Furz.

Ich hab kein Geld, doch dafür ein paar Anzeigen,
Papa hat gesagt, wenn ich was will, dann soll ich dran bleiben.
Ich rapp' für viel Kohle für viele Hoes und dicke Ketten,
ich will 'ne Villa mit 10 Zimmern und 10 Toiletten.
Ich habe oft getickt, den Bitches auf 'n Bauch gespritzt,
ich war so schlau und hab' sogar die Kripo ausgetrickst.
Ich bin ein Gehttokind und muss ab und zu untertauchen,
ihr könnt mich unterschätzen doch niemals für dumm verkaufen.
Ich bin einer der dran bleibt,
mit Kampfgeist,
präsentiere Sektenmuzik und dazu die besten Punchlines.
Während ich texte, lass' ich mir gern' auch einen blazen,
Alpa Gun für B-Tight auf dem Beat von Tai Jason.

Ich habe 46 Fieber und die Temperatur steigt,
es liegt in meiner Natur ich bin extrem Gewaltbereit.
Atzen kommen mit B-Tight und der Rest vom Team Mok,
das is der Abschaum-City-Rock für den Kiez und den Block.
Ich hab' kein Bock auf 'nen Job,
Husteln ist meine Ambition,
ich will ein Haus und 'ne Million wie der Atze Dieter Bohlen.
In der Stadt, wo ich wohne da sind Dämonen zu hause,
sie bedrohen mein Leben kleben an mir ohne Pause.
Atze ich fluche und rauche und haue meine Bitch,
das ist hart aber Standard,
wir sind Abschaum City Kids.

Ich bin der Rapper den deine Freundin gern hätte,
doch ich poppe keine Grotte aber bomb' dich wie 'ne Flotte.
Wenn ich kiffe dann kiff' ich die Killermatte,
ich bin der Killer, der Killer,
du hälst die Backen.
Guck' ich bin ein Deutscher mit Schwarzkopf,
wenn du denkst du bist besser dann leck' mein Arschloch.
Jeden der kommt um zu batteln man den, den zerfetz' ich.

You lift me up, You dust me off, 
You tell me everything will be okay

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand

And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to

And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days

To nights that never end?

Mais je ne sais pas je ne le sais pas toujours
Tu me dis des mots gentils je ne sais pas quoi répondre
Ma tête est au ralenti mes jambes tremblent ma langue tombe
Fais-moi des sourires encore et tu verras
Que le vide au cinquième ne me servira pas
Je laisse aux alentours mes tristes écritures
Mon amour je te ferai ma nouvelle signature

Et même si je ne t’entends pas
Et même si tu ne m’entends pas
C’est comme si je pouvais te sentir
À cinq heures du matin
Et j’attends que le soleil se lève
Pour me faire une idée de mes pensées nocturnes
Le baiser de la mort avec un bec de lièvre
L’enfer m’impose ses coutumes
J’espère qu’on s’entendra toujours bien

Tu me fais couler de l’encre je t’écris un fiasco
Tes petits yeux me manquent je n’me sens plus très beau
L’hiver me force à avoir un peu froid
Je crois que je mérite encore un peu de toi
Cela commence à me faire vraiment mal
Tête à la guillotine je garde les pédales
Terminé le temps de ces copieux repas
Une goutte d’eau fraîche et abracadabra!",Chanson D'amour,

Et ne pouvait plus dire ce qu'elle regrettait
Car en vieillissant on apprend les rouages
Les beaux les super et surtout les mauvais

Merci mon Dieu, merci quand tu cognes
La tête des hommes pour qu'ils se réveillent
Comment veux-tu que quelqu'un te sonne
Les querelles d'en bas quand ce n'est plus toi qui veilles

Ils ont retrouvé toutes ses espérances
Dans le ciel avec ceux qui s'envolent trop tôt
Plus on avance et plus sont les sciences
Qui expliquent le monde et le rendent moins beau

Elle met en couleur ce qui reste de sens
Devant ses grands yeux, devant ses pinceaux
Mais derrière ses rires je sais qu'elle y pense
De s'enfuir dans les îles sur un bateau

Nul n'a besoin d'une thèse pour comprendre
Que Juliette se sent seule sans son Roméo
Que tout ce qui manque ce sont des mots tendres
De celui qui la protégera des oiseaux

Merci mon Dieu, merci quand tu cognes

Je m'invente un bataillon
Ma prière, elle danse
Je l'ai vue sur ta maison
Tous les jours je recommence
J'apprivoise le temps long
Ton errance, belle chair
Seulement si elle m'avait plu
Je m'avoue, je considère
Je te renvoie ton salut

Laisse-moi dans ton coeur

Une époque, une peine
Une chambre et une fleur
Laisse-moi dans ton coeur
Laissant dans ton coeur
Une ronde, une valse
Une danse du bonheur

Notre histoire s'en allait
Sur un boulevard tout petit
Personne ne s'est égaré
Mais notre histoire est finie
Le chemin le plus court
Des regrets bien entendu
Comme une douce rengaine
Je t'en offre un aperçu

Les officiers n'ont plus d'espoir
Ils se contentent de nuits blanches
Des quelques oublis qu'il me reste
Ton sourire et tes gentillesses
Je ne veux plus être au front
Je préfère être en retard

Me vient au ventre un mal soudain
Je me rappelle de toi

Mais je pleure.",Dans ton coeur,

And knowing I'm a dope.
I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string.
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.
I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring?
I keep wishing I were somewhere else, 
Walking down a strange new street.
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a man I've yet to meet.
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing.
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing.
But I feel so gay,
In a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be spring.

In our air-conditioned, patent leather farmhouse,
On our ultra-modern, scientific farm,
We'll live in a stream-lined heaven,
And we'll waste no time on charm!

No virginia creepers, nothing useless !

And an up-standed man is he.
He comes home every night in his round-bottomed boat,
With a net full of herring from the sea.
An almost perfect beau,
As refined as a girl could wish.
But he spends so much time in his round-bottomed boat
That he can't seem to lose the smell of fish.

The first time he kissed me the whiff from his clothes
Knocked me flat on the floor of the room.
But now that I love him, my heart's in my nose
And fish is my fav'rite perfume!

Last night he spoke quite low,
And a fair-spoken man is he.
And he said ""Miss Pipperidge, I'd like it fine
If I could be wed with a wife.
And indeed, Miss Pipperidge, if you'll be mine,
I'll be yours for the rest of my life.""

Next moment we were promised,
And now my mind's in a maze.
For all it can do is look forward to
That wonderful day of days!

When I marry Mister Snow
The flowers'll be buzzin' with the hum of bees
The birds'll make racket in the church yard trees
When I marry Mister Snow
Then it's off to home we'll go.
And both of us'll look a little dreamy-eyed
A driving to a cottage by the Oceanside
Where the salty breezes blow.

He'll carry me 'cross the threshold,
And I'll be as meek as a lamb.
Then he'll set me on my feet,
And I'll say kinda sweet,
""Well, Mister Snow, here I am.""

Then I'll kiss him so he'll know
That evry'thin'll be as right as right can be
A living in a cottage by the sea with me
For I love that Mister Snow.
That young sea-faring,
Bold and daring,
Big bewhiskered, overbearing
Darling Mister Snow.

I'll have you 
You'll be real 
Real as the white moon lighting the blue. 
Out of my dreams and into your arms I long to fly 
I will come as evening comes to woo a waiting sky. 
Out of my dreams and into the hush of falling shadows, 
When the mist is low and stars are breaking through 
Then out of my dreams I'll go 
Into a dream with you.

So far we haven't walked by night and shared the light of a star.

So far your heart has never fluttered so near, so near

That my own heart alone could hear it.

We haven't gone beyond the very beginning,

We've just begun to know how lucky we are.

So we have nothing to remember so far, so far.

But now I'm face to face with you and now at last we've met,

And now we can look forward to the things we'll never forget.

You may see a stranger,
you may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know,
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see her
Again and again.

Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughin',
You may hear her laughin'
Across a crowded room
And night after night,
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it?
Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons,
Wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love,
When you feel her call you
Across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side,
And make her your own
For all through your life you
May dream all alone.

Once you have found her,
Never let her go.
Once you have found her,
Never let her go!","Some Enchanted Evening, song (from ""South Pacific"") [From South Pacific",2002

His heart is not always wise. 
This is a man who stumbles and falls, 
But this is a man who tries. 

This is a man you'll forgive and forgive, 
And help protect, as long as you live... 
He will not always say 
What you would have him say, 
But now and then he'll do 
Something 
Wonderful. 

He has a thousand dreams 
That won't come true, 
You know that he believes in them 
And that's enough for you. 

You'll always go along, 
Defend him where he's wrong 
And tell him, when he's strong 
He is 
Wonderful 
He'll always 
Needs your love 
And so he'll get your love. 
A man who needs your love 
Can be 
Wonderful.

Vencido y maniao
En tu corazón

Te vi pasar tangueando, altanera
Con un compás tan hondo y sensual
Que no fue más que verte y perder
La fe, el coraje, el ansia'e guapear
No me has dejado ni el pucho en la oreja
De aquel pasao malevo y feroz
Ya no me falta pa completar
Más que ir a misa e hincarme a rezar

Ayer, de miedo a matar
En vez de pelear
Me puse a correr
Me vi en la sombra o finao
Pensé en no verte y temblé
Si yo, que nunca aflojé
De noche angustiao
Me encierro a llorar
¡Decí por Dios qué me has da'o
Que estoy tan cambiao
¡No sé más quién soy!",Malevaje,2004

Oh oh oh, Acapulco
Ton rire comme un buffet chinois
Ton corps un all you can eat suʼl top de lʼHimalaya Dans ma patate, jʼtraîne comme un blues
Y court y chiâle tout le long dʼla rue
Oh oh oh, Acapulco

Jʼai beau mʼpéter la tête avec Mario
Brosser toute la nuitʼ avec la princesse de Monaco Chanter Jésus avec Mimi pis Jojo
Vouloir me répandre de Moreau à Chapleau
Oh oh oh, Acapulco

Oh non j’veux rien savoir
Quand en plein jour j’ai peur du noir 
Quand chus s’a track avec la gueule qui shake
Le dick à broil, pis le cerveau à bake

Quand j’en arrache c’pa’ce j’ai d’la marde dans bouche

C’tu l’mois d’décembre ou ben le mois d’mai ?

Si demain matin y déclare des élections
Moi pis lui on vote pour que tu r’viennes à’ maison

Pour que ce soit drôle y faudrait au moins que ce soit l’fun

Que queq’chose arrive ou ben que quelqu’un arrête

A’ lâché les grosses dopes, tombée en amour, c’pas d’sa faute 
Faut croire qu’y ont ben faite ça, leu’ p’tit y’est drôle comme ça s’peut pas 
Tothor, c’est l’plus fort, y’attendrirait l’cœur d’un motard 
Quand qu’y s’prend pour Flash McQueen

50 heures dans l’punch clock, un gros salaire, c’pas une question d’luck 
A’ quasiment toute essayé même les ballons sur son nez

Beau bonhomme, y’est pas bête, en plus de ça, y’est honnête 
Y manque rien qu’une tite bonne femme pour qu’son p’tit cœur soit en fête 
Y traîne avec la fille aux cheveux de champ de blé 
Pis tant qu’à moé, y’ont un drôle d’erre d’aller 
L’amour, c’pas évident, s’entendre avec un autre, c’est aussi tough qu’avec soi

Des centaines de grosses veillées, envoye Amsterdam! Ecstasy!
Mais là, miroir, miroir, qu’est-ce qu’y fait là l’ostie d’cheveu gris? 
20 ans d’grosse liberté pas d’stress pis pas d’rush 
Mais la quarantaine a vient d’sonner pis pas d’bonhomme c’t’un peu poche 
Côté trophée cœur en or a fracasse tous les records 
Mais comme laver du linge c’est dull, ben j’y pardonne ses 2 bords 
Pis si Tothor c’est l’plus fort, j’pense que Vigneault c’est l’plus beau 
L’bonhomme y’a jamais eu d’piaule, y croise une bonne femme y pogne 2 flos 
Sa Jess v’nait d’Beesonville que'que part à Shawinigan County 
A’ pogné les hobo blues à 15 ans, sacré son camp en après-midi

Si j’tais pas un Peterbuilt, j’devais être au moins un Kenworth 
J’ai pris d’la bière avec ODB que’que part en banlieue de Perth 
Une chance que j’ai rien dit pis qu’j’ai rien raconté 
Leurs histoires c’pas d’mes affaires, chez nous l’amitié c’t’un peu heavy

The brindle cow will wag her tail,
As I fill up the pail I'll chase the flies and
I surmise she'll moo, ""Thanks to you.
""I'll feed the chicks, and mix some barley with their corn
They love it so, I know they'll cluck for luck each morn

You could climb across the rooftops, then you'd see
Through the burning sash, I'm free

Get real, I will always be this way

You remind me of lovers I used to chase
Through the golden songs from a golden age
Let me love you today

And then, any other man would think I've done so well
Ten years in masterpiece of gray

And Charlie had a think, and he said, ""Look, Fred 
I got a sort of feelin' 
If we remove the ceiling
With a rope or two we could drop the blighter through""

""All right,"" said Fred, climbing up a ladder 
With his crowbar gave a mighty blow
Was he in trouble, half a ton of rubble landed on the top of his dome
So Charlie and me had another cuppa tea 
And then we went home

(I said to Charlie, ""We'll just have to leave it 
Standing on the landing, that's all 
You see the trouble with Fred is, he's too hasty 
You'll never get nowhere if you're too hasty"")",Right Said Fred,2001
Bernard Dargassies,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Bernard Dargassies,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday

Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Les Enfants du Pirée,1999

Is a place to rest and shelter for my soul.

Free from the prison of your gates, 
Then I could die a happy man.

Does it have to be this way? 

Open your mouth and breathe on me
I need your sensitivity
Through the desert and ravine
I see you in places you ain't been
Pass me up and stall me one more time
Distant arrangements in your mind

Still another reason to live
Still another reason to die

Open your mouth and breathe on me
I need your sensitivity

Open your mouth and breathe on me
Sting the very core of me, sting it now 

Won't you come and see me some time?
Now that we've laid it on the line
Linger a while and the truth
Linger a while on the lies
Won't you come and see me in my dreams?
The only way we meet it seems
Oh why lead me on?
Oh why lead me on?
Open up your mouth and breathe on me
Open up your mouth and breath on me",Breathe on Me,1992
Bernard Fowler,"I was a holy sinner, a prince of the night
Everywhere I went, somebody wanted to fight
Fast as lightning, slick as glass
From heaven to hell, I had a three day pass

Then something came over me
Something sweet and gentle like a morning dove
Stop all my drinking even change the way I'm thinking
It must be love

I was looking for trouble, it wasn't no fun
Got paranoid, started packing a gun
Pay a million dollars for a page of my book
Melt a woman's heart with just one look

Then something came over me
Something sweet and gentle like a morning dove
Here's a little something to let you know
cold chills from head to toe
It must be love, must be love, must be love, must be love

Waitin' for the bus to come,
Thinking about you baby,
Wondering when I'd get me some

Come on lover, come on lover
Let me come through.
Come on show me baby show me, 
Show me what you can do.

Forget about the money
Don't think about the strain
Come inside now out of the cold
And let me take away the pain.

Come on lover, come on lover,
Now that I'm feeling blue
Come on show me baby show me,
Show me what you can do.

I see you coming, and you're coming strong,
You'll be home before too long,
Telling tales of lies and such,
Sometimes baby you're a little too much.

Are asking me what's come over me
There's been a change (there's been a change)

And it's taken me by surprise
Happiness surrounds me
You can see it in my eyes

Had to look up at my feet

Don't you know that 
I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me

Once I was a hollow man
In which a lonely heart did dwell
You know love came creeping upon me
Bringing life to an empty shell

That your love could be so bad
I just want to tell you people
It's the best love I ever had

Love you all the time

Searching for the truth in love 
That's in my heart 

Tell me if I made the wrong advances 
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed 
Cause I know I have to do this 
Would you hold my hand right through it 

Cause when I close my eyes 
I still can see your smile 
It's bright enough to light my life 
Out of my darkest hour 
Please believe it's true

Just what would happen 
Yes, i have to let you know the truth

Dans sa tasse de café, éteint la stéréo
Éteint le lampadaire, éteint le plafonnier
Éteint dans la cuisine, met la sécurité

C'est la nuit
Quelques pills pour dormir, je n'sais plus où je suis
Un store noir, une porte, un lit
C'est l'ennui
Rien à faire pour l'amour, mais ne dis pas toujours

Que fais-tu, est-ce que tu penses à moi?
D'où viens-tu, un jour tu partiras

Tu fumes et tu veilles
T'es toute écorchée
T'es comme un chat triste
Perdu sur la liste
Des objets trouvés
La nuit carcérale
Tombant sur les dalles
Et ce lit glacé
Aller et venir
Soleil et sourire
Sont d'l'autre coté

Ces murs, ces grillages
Ces portes et ces cages
Ces couloirs, ces clés
Cette solitude
Si dure et si rude
Qu'on peut la toucher
Ce rayon de lune
Sur le sol allume
Visage oublié
De celui que t'aimes
Qui tire sur sa chaîne
Comme un loup blessé

T'aimerais plus t'réveiller, plus jamais rêver

Je te dis je t'aime
Dans ce court poème
Dans ce long baiser
Tu es ma frangine
Juste une féminine
Que j'avais rimée
Je te donne ma force
Mes mots et mes notes
Pour te réchauffer
Je hais la morale
Les prisons centrales
Les maisons d'arrêt

Je n'ai pas sommeil
Je fume et je veille
Et j'ai composé
Une chanson d'amour
Une chanson secours
Pour l'autre côté
Pour ceux que l'on jette
Dans les oubliettes
Dans l'obscurité
Pendant qu'les gens dorment
Au fond du conforme
Sans se réveiller

Rongés par le cancer infernal de la fuite

J'essaie de modifier dans le creux de ma main
La ligne d'un bonheur inconnu, incertain
Car le malheur rend fou

Terminus Nord, ma créole
Vacille dans les vapeurs d'alcool
J'entends des sifflets, des sourdos
Des cris de singes, des chants d'oiseaux

Pour me demander si je pars

Dans la jungle à la lune pleine
Les papillons ne se brûlent pas sur les lanternes
Ils montent cette nuit-là vers les hautes ténèbres
On regarde de loin briller leurs ailes bleues
On raconte ces choses dans le nord du Brésil
Il m'a semblé les voir se perdre dans les fils
Des araignées velues dévoreuses de rêve
Mais la jungle rend fou

Assis à l'ombre des mangos
Dans la taverne d'Eldorado
Les rêves d'or ont la peau dure
Comme les diamants sous le carbure
Elle me regarde et me soupèse
Il est trop tard ou bien trop tôt
Elle me questionne sans dire un mot

Du côté du couchant, du sang et de l'espoir
Du côté des chercheurs tombés dans les abîmes
Du côté du parfum des femmes
Mais le parfum rend fou

Dans la taverne d'Eldorado
Fait hurler les hommes et les chiens

On the road again, again, 
On the road again, again. 

Au petit jour on quittait l'Irlande 
Et, derrière nous, s'éclairait la lande.
Il fallait bien, un jour, qu'on nous pende.

Ceux qui vivent au soleil, avec des femmes blanches dans les villas
Et ceux qui mangent pas, sapés comme des nababs à l'Opéra
La voilà

C'est une latine de Manhattan, de la résine de macadam
Un coup de fouet, de haut en bas, qui te soulève, c'est la Salsa

C'est une frangine portoricaine qui vit dans le Spanish Harlem
Les reins cambrés au bon endroit, elle est superbe
C'est la Salsa

Une sauce mélo de te quiero mucho et de cafard
Une sauce mais là c'est le Christ qui te saigne pour vingt dollars
Une sauce mêlée de beauté, de souplesse et de conga
Une sauce lamée comme la peau de la fille qui danse pour moi

C'est une latine de Manhattan, de la résine de macadam
Un coup de fouet, de haut en bas, qui te soulève, c'est la Salsa

C'est une frangine portoricaine qui vit dans le Spanish Harlem
Les reins cambrés au bon endroit, elle est superbe
C'est la Salsa

Tout seul dans la nuit chaude, je la garde serré contre mon cœur
Malgré la mort qui rode, chuchotant quelque chose à son chauffeur
Y'en a marre des palaces, elle s'en va faire des passes pour le panard
Je la suis à la trace, ramassant ses paillettes sur le trottoir

C'est une latine de Manhattan, de la résine de macadam

Bernard Lavilliers,"Caruarú Hotel Centenario, suite princière
Vvue sur les chiottes, télé couleur, courant alternatif
Les pales du ventilateur coupent tranche à tranche
L'air épais du manioc

Le dernier texaco vient de fermer ses portes
Y a guère que les moustiques pour m'aimer de la sorte
Leurs baisers sanglants m'empêchent de dormir
Bien fait pour ma gueule ! J'aurais pas dû venir

Calé dans ton fauteuil tu écoutes ma voix
Comme un vieux charognard tu attends que je crache
La gueule jaune des caboclos, Antonio Des Morte
Capangas machos à la solde des fazendeiros

Pour te donner un avant-goût de vacances intelligentes
Ceux qui vendent du soleil à tempérament
Les cocotiers, les palaces, et le sable blanc

Ne viendront jamais par ici
Remarque il paraît que voir les plus pauvres que soi, ça rassure
Alors allez-y, ici, tout le monde peut venir, ici il n'y a rien

Un soleil ivre de rage tourne dans le ciel
Et dévore le paysage de terre et de sel
Où se découpe l'ombre de lampião
D'où viendront les cangaceiros de la libération?
Le cavalier que je croise sur son cheval roux
Son fusil en bandoulière qui tire des clous

A traversé ce désert, la sèche et la boue
Pour chercher quelques cruzeiros à Caruarú
Un éternel été émiette le sertão
Le temps s'est arrêté en plein midi
Il y a déjà longtemps

En attendant que l'enfer baisse l'abat-jour
Qu'on se penche sur ta misère du haut de la tour
Tu n'as que de la poussière pour parler d'Amour
Aveuglé par la lumière comme dans un four

Que tous les chanteurs des foires gueulent ta chanson
Même si c'est le désespoir qui donne le ton
Tu n'as pas peur de la mort, même tu l'attends
Avec ton parabellum au cœur du sertão

Un soleil ivre de rage tombe dans le ciel
Et dévore le paysage de terre et de sel
Où se découpe l'ombre de lampião
D'où viendront les cangaceiros de la libération
Sertão, sertão, sertão

Y a du sang sur le trottoir

C´est sa voix, poussière brûlée
C´est ses ongles sur le blindé.

J'entends battre son cœur

Comme d´une arme de précision.

Bernard Lavilliers,"C'était à Rio de Janeiro
Une ampoule jaune pendait au plafond
Elle me demandait avec son regard étrange
Tu pars, tu pars demain?
Elle a fait glisser sa bague
Autour de ses doigts et posé ses deux mains
Tout près de mon cœur et demandé des nouvelles
D'ailleurs, du monde entier

Sou o gringo que não fala brasileiro
Ele é o gringo que não fala brasileiro
Meu teto é o céu meu leito é o mar

Elle faisait Copacabana
Les vieux allemands tristes
Et les marins saouls
Elle venait du Nord et croyait que la misère
Ici, c'était moins dur
Pendant que les grands s'affrontent
À coup de calibres, de whiskys glacés
Dans les grands salons de Leblon et d'Ipanema
Petit, tu peux crever

J'ai laissé tous mes cruzeiros
Au coin de son lit et je me suis cassé
Seul, dans les chemins qui descendent vers la mer
Le fric, les hauts-placés
Tu ne sauras pas criola
Que cette chanson je l'ai composée
Au petit matin, en descente de Maconha
Pour toi, du monde entier",O Gringo,1999

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in

Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

What about the time we met?
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get.
Didn't understand a thing,
But we could always sing.

What about the night we cried,
Because there was no reasons left to keep it all inside?
Didn't understood a word,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1958

But I won't be happy

You can see a distant steeple

Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me

I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

The myst'ry of their fading light

Across the sand so I may keep

Of you beside me here beneath the blue

It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak 
Angels sing from above

Seems to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be

I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Bernard Wright,"Please, let me make a true confession
I had never been in love before
But since you came in my direction
I've had a change, a change of heart
My girl said come a dime a dozen
I fed them things they love to hear
I never was wanting for a lover
But I never knew that true love was indeed

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Girl I'm in love with you
Are you for sure?
Sure as the sky is blue
Who do you love?
Just let me prove to you
Are you for sure?
Yes, girl my love is true

I used to be the great pretender
For the very first time I'm for real
You've got me listening to my heart now
You gotta believe how real
I am ready to be become the giver
Now that I realized that it is give and take
Oh, love has broken my defenses
This time I'm not just only me
I gotta tell you babe...

[Chorus]

How do I know that you won't go, please tell me
I don't want to lose your love 
And if it's true, I'll stay with you
That would make me so happy
How do I know that you won't go, please tell me
I don't want to lose your love
And if it's true, I'll stay with you
That would make me so happy

All this cash that I'm counting
House in a mountain
Two green houses and a water fountain (Scarface)

And if she replies with words that don't make sense it may be just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her lack of understanding just because you think you could
Treat her right, treat her good, take her home and make her feel the way she should

Just remember she's not like the other girls she may not want them all to know
Though she may need a little time she never wants to stand in line the way they would
So treat her nice, treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

And when she's making love to you, she'll do what you want her to
Treat her good, treat her like you know you should

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,

Why can't I let you know,

Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

Bernie Marsden,"And when the roses are half-bud soft flowers
And lovely as the king of flies has come
It was a fleeting visit, all too brief
In three short minutes, he had been and gone

A gorgeous opal crown sat on his head
Although the garden is a lovely place
Was it worthy of so fine a guest

As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
And cold spirits of ice
All my life I am the echo of your past (echo of your past)

I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your, all your life shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect strangers

I know 
I know, I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Oh, is aching with the dead of the night
Oh oh precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
