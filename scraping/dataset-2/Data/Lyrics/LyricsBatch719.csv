Michael Ball,"I know
That when she said that
We could be friends
That my heart turned to stone
Broken again
How come
That I'm feelin' that the way I do
'cause the hurting is gone
And it's true - 'cause of you
Chorus:
I found that secret of love again
Oh and every time I turn around
There you are
(there you are)
Crying is done
'cause I found the secret of love...
Ooh yeah

I've shown
I'm not immune to the power of love
I was chilled to the bone
I've had enough
But it's all gone
An empty space
Where my heart used to be
But since you came along
Can't you see
Rescue me
Chorus
We'll call it divine intervention
A bolt from the blue
It was never my intention
Ooh what can I do

Chorus
",Secret of Love,2001
Michael Ball,"Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and we shall find
So I'm gonna seek a certain girl I have in mind
Looking everywhere,haven't found her yet
She's the big affair,I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret...
I would like to add my initials to her monogram
Oh.. tell me where is the shepperd
For this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who watch over me
Well, I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'lI watch over me
Although I may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
To her heart I'll carry the key
Oh.. Won't you tell her, please,
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need...
Someone to watch over me...
Someone to watch over me.",Someone to Watch over Me,2001
Michael Ball,"Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together,
I'm weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.

All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Can't go on, every thing I had is gone
Stormy weather

Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time",Stormy Weather,2001
Michael Ball,"When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand, believe me, believe me",You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,2001
Michael Ball,"You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it.

You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times dear
Oh you made me feel so bad

You made me cry 'cause
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I need a love that's true
Yes I do, deed I do, you know I do

I don't care what happens
When the whole world stops
As far as I'm concerned
You'll always be the tops cause
You know you made me love you

You made me cry 'cause
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I need a love that's true
Yes I do, deed I do, you know I do

Gimme, gimme, gimme, what I cry for
You got the kinda kisses
That I would die for
You know you made me love you
Oh, you know you made me love you

Michael Ball,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Michael Ball,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Living alone
I think of all the friends Ive known
When I dial the telephone
Nobodys home
Chorus:
All by myself
I dont wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
I dont wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and insecure
Remains the cure

I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun

Michael Ball,"How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

How can I be sure?  I really really really wanna know.
I really really really wanna know.  Oh.

How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?  I'll be sure with you.",How Can I Be Sure,2001
Michael Ball,"I can see
You're slipping away from me
And you're so afraid
That I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
And let you go your way

Love is gone
There's no sense in holding on
And your pity now
Would be more than I could bare
But I'm gonna be strong
And pretend I don't care

I'm gonna be strong
And stand as tall as I can
I'm gonna be strong
And let you go along
And take it like a man

When you say it's the end
I'll hand you a line
I'll smile and say
Don't you worry I'm fine
But you'll never know darling
After you kiss me goodbye
How I'll break down and cry",I'm Gonna Be Strong,2001
Michael Ball,"If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts would tell
Just like an old-time movie
Out a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts would tell
Just like a paperback novel
That kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part
Where the heartache comes
The hero would be me
The heroes often fail
You won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets spurned in a three-way script
Enter number two
The movie queen to play the scene
And bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real

[Chorus]
I never thought I could feel this way
And I got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts would tell
Just like an old-time movie
About a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
Stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You know that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack

[Chorus]

If you could read my mind, love",If You Could Read My Mind,2001
Michael Ball,"Some say love,
It is a river that drowns the tender reed.
Some say love,
It is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love,
It is a hunger, an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
And you it's only seed.
It's the heart, afraid of breaking,
That never learns to dance.
It's the dream, afraid of waking,
That never takes a chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give.
And the soul, afraid of dying,
That never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely,
And the road has been to long,
And you think that love is only for
The lucky and the strong
Just remember
In the winter far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose.",The Rose,2001
Michael Ball,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you...

Say you love me
Every waking moment,
Turn my head
With talk of summertime...

Say you need me with you,
Now and always . . .
Promise me that all
You say is true -
That's all I ask of you...

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light.
You're safe:
No-one will find you

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night...
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me...

Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime...
Let me lead you from your solitude...

Say you need me with you
Here, beside you...
Anywhere you go,
Let me go too -
That's all I ask of you...

Michael Ball,"With one look 
I can break your heart 
With one look 
I can play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look 
You'll know what you need to know 
 
With one smile 
I'm the guy next door 
All the love you've hungered for 
When I speak is with my soul 
I can play any role 
No words can tell 
The stories my eyes tell 
Watch me when I frown 
You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say 
Yes
With one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look I set the screen on flame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear in my eye 
makes the whole world cry 
With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice I return at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look 
You'll know all you need to know 
With one look 
I'll ignite the blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say, ""Look, who's back at last!"" 
This time 
I'm staying 
Staying for good 
I'll be back 
where I was born to be

I'll be me",With One Look,2001
Michael Ball,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night.

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh Daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever,2001

Michael Ball,"Don't give me mountains that I can't climb
Don't give me water, you could give me wine
Don't give me the sun if it won't shine
Give me love, give me love
Don't give me sand, it slips through my fingertips
Why kiss my cheek, you could kiss my lips
Don't give me words that don't mean a thing
Give me love, give me love

You say you'll never love again
Love has caused you all the pain
I say come this way and see what I'll give you
I'll give you love, I'll give you love

Don't play games, I just can't win
Don't give me it all, to take away

Suddenly it all to me she's not the same
I don't even know when she began to change
All the months together
Yet so far apart
If only we could get back to the start

I remember things we don't do no more
Maybe it is freedom she is looking for
If only she could tell me
Tell me what is wrong
And maybe once again we could be strong

Chorus:
She used to be the real thing
She always made your heart sing
No more
There she stands but she's not there
She says it's neverending
But I know she's just pretending
She's gone
There she stands but she's not there

Almost every evening we would tell the town
It moved so fast
My feet would hardly touch the ground
All the months together
Now we were apart
Only we could get back to the start!

Chorus

We were sharing so much fun
Love would lead the way
Would make it up as we went on
Just litte for the day
Now I look into her eyes
And there is no mistake
She tries the best
But she can't hide
I hope it's not too late

Chorus

She used to be the real thing
She always made your heart sing..

How strong the power of love can be
Sometimes you just take my breath away
You watch my love grow like a child
Sometimes gentle and sometimes wild

It's too good to lose
It's too good to be there
Just to use
I'm gonna stand on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away
Your beauty is there in all I see
And when I feel your eyes on me

Michael Ball,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica
Si alzò dal pianoforte 
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvisso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette d'affogare

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono i pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai

Withered leaves collected at my feet 
And the wind begins to blow 

Memory 
All alone in the moonlight 
I can smile at the old days 
I was beautiful then 
I remember 
The time I knew what happiness was 
Let the memory live again 

Every street lamp 
Seems to beat 
A fatalistic warning 
Someone mutters 
And the street lamp gutters 
And soon 
It will be morning 
 
Daylight, 
I must wait for the sunrise 
I must think of a new life 
And I mustn't give in 
When the dawn comes 
Tonight will be a memory too 
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days 
The stale cold smell of morning 
The streetlamp dies, 
Another night is over 
Another day is dawning 

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me 
All alone with the memory 
Of my days in the sun 
If you touch me 
You'll understand what happiness is 
Look, a new day has begun",Memory,2003

To make that person black and blue

Is a step along the way

There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone

Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about tomorrow
And tomorrow never came.

From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
And I can hear them now!
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lowly barricade..
At dawn.

Oh my friends, my friends forgive me.

That I live and you are gone
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on

Phantom faces at the window

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here

Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

Where the strong and the quick alone can survive
Look around the jungle 
See the rough and tumble
Listen to a squealer cry
Then a little later in the morning paper
Read about the way he died

Wake up my pretty
Go to the city
Stay through the daytime
Safe in the sunshine 
Stay till the daytime turns into night

In the avenues and alleyways
Where a man's gotta work out which side he's on
Anyway he chooses 
Chances are he looses
No one gets to live too long

The avenues and alleyways
Where the soul of a man is easy to buy
Everybody's wheelin'
Everybody's dealin'
All the low and living hyde

Have gotta try",Avenues and Alleyways [*],2011
Michael Ball,"Night-time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I compose the music of the night

Slowly, gently, night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing music is deceiving
Hard as lightening, soft as candlelight
Dare you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes, and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me

Floating (floating), falling (falling), sweet intoxication
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me), savour each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night

The wonderful Il Divo

Feel the magic in the making

I'm trembling now, you cant know how Ive missed you

Could I stop my hand from shaking?

With so much to live for?

There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone.

Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about 'tomorrow'
And tomorrow never came

From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
I can hear them now
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn!

Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me
That I live and you are gone.
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on.

Phantom shadows on the floor

Sailing on summer breeze

Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
They've all gone crazy, mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over themselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go

Demand to be buried like Eva Peron

For the country in a roundabout way

Of all the world's papers today

Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

Outside the Casa Rosada crying, Eva Peron

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

With the one I love, Massachusetts
Just like Jack and Jill, Massachusetts
We'll climb Bunker Hill, Massachusetts

Where they can't say can't, Massachusetts

[Chorus x4]
Throw em up if you a soldier, if you dodging these niggas, these bitches and
the rollers

The clock hits twelve, I'm on the grind
Punching your code if you want these nickles, quarters and dimes
I got the ghetto soed up like mack diamonds and windy
And I got more sealers than JC Pennies
Throw it up if you a soldier
But if you a punk motherfucker talkin shit and working with the rollers
You better duck down quick when the tank pops
Cause we be slanging automatic fucking slangshots
I went from halves, to hoes with weed to working water
From selling grams, to motherfuckin quarters
From quarter keys, to really tapes and cd's
Not every nigga in the hood knows me
Uhhhhhh, but getting rowdy
Stayin TRU to the game, and still bout it bout it

I'm a represent my hood till I die
And when I'm gone put it on the blimp and let it ride
Third ward, calliope, nigga Master P

ain't no mugging, just thugs with me
ain't no hugging, ain't no loving P
These ghetto heroes is dead and gone
That's why niggas in the ghetto live like Al Capone
I be breaking niggas like ice in Iceland
Crushing niggas like sevens in dice games
Nickel plated meters knocking down doors
With hoes and gators, jaboes and polo's
So watch your back when you hustling crack
Cause jackers take your life away and ain't no coming back
Uh, I seen a lot of movies, but this shit is real
And only cars get brand new grills

For selling crack and, jack and gun clapping and rapping
Watch me smoke my little weed, got my drink and bud

The bluefish on the hook;
The pain they bear is nothing like
The ache I bear for you, my dear

For though I go I'll surely come again
Though it be ten thousand miles, my dear

We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
How can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain",Visions of Johanna,2005

Michael Boddicker,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

But it may be too late when you make up your mind

You keep me in this fools' game
Forever in your fools' game
You got me caught up in this fools' game
Such a fools' game, oh no, a fools' game
How long will you keep me in this fools' game?",Fools Game,1983
Michael Bolton,"Well, all right, you put your heart and your soul on the line
You pay the price; you can leave all your dues behind, yeah
You go spinning your wheels till just one song makes it right
Live your life on the road; now they call you a star overnight
Overnight, overnight, oh, no, no

[Chorus]
Gave it all; for it seemed like ages
Lived the life of a rolling stone
Seen the world from a thousand stages
There ain't no feelin' you've ever known
Like when a hometown boy comes home

This guy's a joker, and this is not the key to your town
And there's always somebody who thinks he makes a living
From putting you down
You're aware of the odds just forgetting the chance you must take
When you're bound to a vision, there is no decision to make
No, no, no

[Chorus]

When he comes home
The road is long and you're on your own
But through it all you know your roots run so deep
Out on the rock-'n'-roll highway
You make a promise to bring it back home
And that's one promise you know ya gotta keep

[Chorus]

But it's never gonna feel like
When a hometown boy comes home
He's a hometown hero",Hometown Hero,1983
Michael Bolton,"You came to me and told me it was over
You assured me you wouldn't need him anymore
But that look upon your face is too familiar
It was long ago, but I've been there before

And this song is like a movie that we might as well pretend
From the moment as the camera closes in
Just say it one more time with feeling
One more time like you really mean it
The last time you told me you loved me
I almost believed you

If I'd never realized what I was asking for
I'd be confused upon the the presence of your pain
Though your smile cannot disguise the hurt within you
It appears upon the mention of his name

But most of all the strangest thing
It's hard for me to bear
That the words that should be music to my ears

Say it one more time with feeling
One more time like you really mean it
The last time you told me you loved me
I almost believed it

Sometimes I wish that you'd save that line for someone else
Do you want me to believe what you don't believe yourself
Well, let's not talk about it now
In my life I've made mistakes
This is just one chance I'll have to take

So let's carry on with the story
Try and shoot the scene again
As the moment that the camera closes in
Just say it one more time with feeling
One more time like you really mean it
The last time you told me that you loved me

I almost believed you (I almost believed you)
Say it one more time (I almost believed you)
One more time with feeling (I almost believed you)
Almost, I almost believed you
One more time with feeling",I Almost Believed You,1983
Michael Bolton,"The time is right for the doorway to the open sky
But a moment passing by, we let it slip away
Well, we can take the night to sanctify this burnin'
In an everlasting sight it's calling us to stay

Here tonight, I can feel the heart of my fantasy
In a while I will reveal the secrets you gave to me
Oh, your love waits so deep for me

And it's all right, all right here in paradise
I know it's all right--feels so right here in paradise
It's all right, all right here in paradise
I know it's all right--feels so right here in paradise, yeah

In a world outside, the voice of our insanity
The world in all its madness is fading like a memory
I long to hold you now; this love of mine will never die
Till there's no space or time, no distance between you and I

There's a fire in my heart that will burn till I find a way
Here inside we can feel what our words were not meant to say
Our words can't pretend to say

That came inside her game, boy
You were so young and very proud
It's hard believin' you're the same, boy

Did she take you so deep into the night
And promise you a piece of her heart
Make it feel so good, feel so right
Then turn around and tear you apart?

[Chorus]
I know
She did the same thing
I know
She did the same thing
I know
She did the same thing to me, oh yeah

She plays upon your dreams and fantasies
As if she's come to stay there
But in your life you never dreamed
You'd find the one who'd know the way there

She'll take you so deep into the night
And promise you'll be satisfied
Like a fool you believe all her lies
Words you'll remember till the end of your life

Michael Bolton,"I can't get you back
But I can't turn away from you
Our love is a fact
Though I've tried to deny it like you wanted me to

I brake on the streets
The people they stop and stare
Was it only a dream? You said you must leave
So why do you follow me everywhere?

I run for my life
Can't break away from your spell
You know it cuts deep inside
Oh, it's like Heaven and Hell

[Chorus]
Can't turn it off, can't turn it off, I said
I can't turn it off; why do you follow me?
Can't turn it off; you turned it on and now I
Can't turn it off

If I'm goin' down, I'm sure to go down in flames
I wait for your sound
I look for you now and I can't hold you to blame

I know you feel guilty, for things we've said and done
To you I'm a moment of fire in your life
But it's different for me, you're the only one

I run for my life
Can't break away from your spell
You know it cuts deep inside
Oh, it's like Heaven and Hell

[Chorus]

I still see your face; it's all I can bear
Knowing wherever I run, you'll always be there

Michael Bolton,"It's in your eyes--here we go again
Tonight you're gonna come on strong
Such a cryin' shame--the time we spend
Over who's been right and who's been wrong

There'll be no pretending this time
Your eyes are like fire
You'll swear it's the end of the line
But you and I we both know you're a liar

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that it's over
Don't tell me that we're through
Don't tell me that it's over
Don't try and tell me that it's over
It isn't true
Don't tell me that it's over
'Cause you can't say goodbye any more
Than I can walk away from you

You say it's hard to love a man like me
But, baby, now and then
You do your fair share so easily
You can push me to my limit
And back again

Just when I can't take anymore
And I've made up my mind
I say I'm ready to walk out the door
But somethin' keeps me from leavin' you behind

[Chorus]

There's a reason why
After we've tried
We're not runnin' to the arms of another

When all comes down
We both know by now
We just still mean too much to each other

It's more than I need to survive
Just when I stopped believin'

You turned it around
Within you I found
Everything that's real to me
I'm lost inside your love
And that's just where I want to be

[Chorus]
Every time you give your love, it's a fire, it's a miracle
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle
You've got the power, you know it
To touch my every fantasy
When we make love, you show it
In everything you give me

So take what you want, take what you will
You're the one who holds the key
To open up the door, to reach the deepest part of me

True hearts can beat as one
Lost souls--I've seen their faces
Girl, after the fire is gone

Torn hearts, dreams are broken
Love shattered before their eyes

Or do they know where the secret lies?

We've got so much more to say
And far too much to lose

Before this night is through

Save our love
Stay a little longer

Thinking of you; then I'd cry myself to sleep

You swore you'd be leavin' behind?

By leavin' me for somebody else

She gets so confused by her friends and their scenes
They don't mean what they say
They don't say what they mean
She reads the signs, reads between the lines
But it makes no difference
There's no reason or rhyme

There's music in the wind
Let's dance one more time
There's a rhythm deep within
Let's dance one more time

One more time
Sing the song
There's a power in our voices
Hopeful and strong

Years from now
Somewhere down the line
We'll remember and we'll all sing
One more time

You always said I'd never know how much I loved you
Until it was too late to make you stay
I know it looked as though I took our love for granted
That doesn't mean I wasn't feeling all the things
I meant to say


( Suzie )
And who was I always asking so much of you
To make you prove your love time after time
Until I found myself living my life without you
How could I have been so foolish, how could
I be so blind


CHORUS
( Michael&Suzie )
From now on I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
I don't want to wait until our time has come and gone
I'm gonna hold you now more than ever
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you, from now on


We both know it's true, when we're open to each other
There's a love we'll never find with someone else
And if we give it half a chance we'll be starting over
So let me make your heart believe what I've been
promising myself

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by the fire

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

Just to be strong

As we race across the heavens to embrace the universe

They say that money talks but you and I
Know places money just don't say enough

Let there be love where there is emptiness
Let there be faith where hope is gone
Let there be strength where there is helplessness

Let there be love, let there be love

We live divided behind imaginary walls
Brother against brother, we just watch each other fall
With hearts united we will never stand so tall

Every day another heart gets broken
While the flame of hate survives

Let there be faith where hope is gone
Let there be strength where there is helplessness

Michael Bolton,"I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world, I will face its harms

And now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they did their tricks for you
You never understood it ain't no good
Shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you, oh

You used to ride on a chrome horse with a diplomat
Carried on his shoulder, siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that he really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel? How does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple, all the pretty people
Drinking, thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
Better lift your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused
Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to loose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

Turned a whiter shade of pale

As my arms reach out and the walls come down
I surrender
I´m a fool in a game, I got no way to win
Take control of my heart, I give up, I give in
I surrender, I surrender to you

Heartache shatters loves´ innocence 
My trusting days are through
My resistance was my best defense
But I never counted on you
You got the key to my destiny, babe,
I´m just a willing slave
I can´t walk away, no, baby, I can´t walk away

You just call my name and you turn me around
My arms reach out and the walls come down
I surrender
Like a fool in a game, I got no way to win
Take control of my heart, I give up, I give in
I surrender, I surrender

Here I am trying to hold back the ocean
Drowning in the sea of desire
I´ve been betrayed by my own emotions
You and my senses conspire

(You just call my name) call my name (and you turn me around)
I surrender! I´m a fool in a game, I got no way to win
Take control of my heart, I give up, I give in 
I surrender, I surrender to you
I surrender, surrender, surrender to you

That´s where I can be found",I Surrender,2002

God I never want to know 'til you brought me back to life
Been forever since I love somebody till I cry because of you
Because of you
I can feel again
I can feel again

My heart was going through the motion of beating
But I was faking everything breath I take
You taught me with the single kiss
Simple truth I almost miss

And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new

(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)

(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever

Until the ocean severs every mountain high)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As [From the Motion Picture Snow Dogs],2002

Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
When you think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So, baby, don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever

Oh, all the tears are gonna dry you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But, baby, that old luck's gonna change

[Chorus]

Baby, oh baby you just need some
You just need some

Time, love, and tenderness
The hurt ain't gonna last forever

Michael Bolton,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
And turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
And trying to hold on to what he needs

He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
And, baby, baby, please, don't treat me bad

Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery

Without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water like Noah made the ark

This is a man's world, a man's world
But it wouldn't mean nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girl and a baby boy
Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man makes everything, everything he can
You know that man makes that money to buy from another man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't mean nothing, not one little thing
Without a woman or a girl, no, no

The world would mean nothing without a woman
Woman or a girl, oh yeah

This is a man's world, oh it's a man's world
But it don't mean nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl, oh no, no

You know I need
But it wouldn't mean nothing, not one little thing

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got (yeah)

To your precious love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool

Oh great, send him in.
Hey guys
Hey, thanks for coming.
How's it goin'?
I'm really sorry I'm late
I just got caught up watching the Pirates of the Caribbean marathon
Have you seen those things?
Oh yeah, yeah, those are, those are great.
Well I checked out the track and I loved it,
And I wrote you this big, sexy hook I think you're gonna really dig.
Oh wow that's great, awesome.
You wanna just lay it down?
Boys let's get to it (to it to it to it)

Uh, Lonely Island, Michael Bolton (Yeah)
The night starts now
Together on the track, the boys are back
The night starts now
Night starts now, baby, roll with us
Chickens snapping at the neck when we rollin' up (Rollin' up!)
Blow through the doors, ain't no holdin' up
Black card at the bar like I gives a fuck (Come on!)

Ladies shifty eyed when we walk into the set
Fuck the fellas looking jealous
Play the back and get wet (Yeah yeah)
Three pound in my waist, shank in my sock,
You either get cut, get stuffed or get shot.

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
Pirate so brave on the seven seas (What?)
A mystical quest to the isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean's breeze

Yeah that was kinda weird, but we're back in the club
Buying up the bar so the groupies show us love (Keira Knightley!)
Motherfucking ice-man, I'm the top gunner
Heater on blast, I'm the number one stunner (Jack Sparrow!)

Watch it girl cause I ain't your ""Mr. Nice Guy"",
More like the ""meet ya, take you home and fuck you twice guy""

All dressed up with nowhere to run,
And now I make you feel crazy with the-
(Now back to the good part!)

From the day he was born
He yearned for adventure (No!)
Old Captain Jack (Yeah)
Giving them what for
He's the pauper of the surf
The jester of Tortuga (Oh God)
But is Davy Jones' locker
What lies in store? (Yeah, we've seen the movie)

Throw your hands in the air
And say hell yeah

Say we count stacks c'mon

Davy Jones (Nope)
Giant squid (Wrong)

Michael Bolton we're really gonna need you to focus up

Roger that let me try it with another film (Wait)
Life is a box of chocolates and my name is Forrest Gump (Not better)
Though I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
I give Jenny all my love (Come on)
Okay, then I'm a legal aid
Erin Brockovich is my name (Oh God)
Then you can call me Scarface
Snortin' mountains of cocaine (Close enough)
You cockroaches wanna play rough?
Okay, I'm reloaded! Ha ha!

This is the tale of Tony Montana
Cubano flame with the Miami nuts
(Take it home!)
Got a basehead wife
But her womb is polluted
This whole town's a pussy
Just waiting to get fucked
Just waiting to get fucked!

Girl, you're such a bad influence,
I've got to stay away.

I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,
And it's you pretty baby,
I've just got to stay away from.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad that we parted.

[Chorus]

Somebody please, you've got to help me break away.
You know I don't like this lonely feeling.
It wasn't meant to be this way.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad we parted.

Michael Brecker,"I was ready to take a chance,
I found myself a new romance.
Then you call that same old night,
Always change my mind.

Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.

[Chorus:]
Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again.
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.
Now I'm hung up on your love again.

Just as I was doing good,
You come back, just to prove you could.
Things will always be the same,
With me the victim of the game.

Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.

Michael Brecker,"Don't change your mind,
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doing fine.
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.

You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.

No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.

Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.

[Chorus]

I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.

I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm just not quite happy, baby,
'bout your crazy plans to leave.",Miss You,1986
Michael Brecker,"[Chorus:]
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.

If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

Michael Brecker,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Because I might be too busy trying to participate.
So if this does end up being the last letter,

And you helped me.

Even if you didn't know what I was talking about
Or know someone who's gone through it.
You made me not feel alone.

Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen.
And there are people who forget what it's like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen.
And know these will all be stories someday
And our pictures will become old photographs
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.
But right now these moments are not stories.

This is happening.
I am here and I am looking at her
And she is so beautiful.
I can see it.
This one moment when you know you're not a sad story,
You are alive.
And you stand up and see the lights on buildings
And everything that makes you wonder,

On that drive with the people you love most in this world.

Michael Bublé,"Away in a manger, no crib for the bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is neigh.

Believe me, Lord Jesus, I asked thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with thee there.

I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown-up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child, but my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself, but for a world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called the innocence of youth?
Maybe only in that blind belief can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end

How I hate going out in the storm

All the way home I'll be warm

There's a bar in far Bombay

In lama land, there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide

Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear the angels cheer
Just because we're together

Michael Bublé,"Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the the morning, fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""

Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""daddy-o don't you dare""

Give me fever with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever,2003

When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow

You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will

Steal your heart from you

Will always make a lover feel a fool

We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So far
But please don’t take my heart

You are far
I’m never gonna be your star
I’ll pick up the pieces
To mend my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you’d love me too

I said you must have been kissing a fool

But remember this
Every other kiss
That you’ll ever give
Long as we both live

One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you
Like I always do
There’s something there
That can’t compare with any other

Like painted kites, those days and nights - went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue - umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man - one day it called to you
And I lost you, to the summer wind

And still the days, those lonely days - go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies - through nights that never end

Michael Bublé,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love

Well I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own
And everytime I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love

Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

One more moondance with you in the moonlight
Can't I just have one more dance with you my love",Moondance [Album Version][Live],2003

Another time to contemplate and think
Will I ever, ever have anyone to love

Maybe I try too hard
Seems like I'm living a lie

Why I haven't anyone to love

I guess I'll say goodnight

Michael Bublé,"I'm a man of reason, and they say
""'Tis the season to be jolly but it's folly when you volley for position""

Never in existence has there been such a resistance
To ideas meant to free us
If you could see us, then you'd listen

Toiling through the ages, making toys on garnished wages
There's no union
We're only through when we outdo the competition

I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf

A full indentured servitude can reflect on one's attitude
But that silly red hat just makes the fat man look outrageous

Absurd though it may seem, you know, I've heard there's even been illegal doping
And though we're coping, I just hope it's not contagious

You try to start a movement, and you think you see improvement
But when thrown into the moment, we just don't seem so courageous

I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price to an elf

You look at yourself, you're an elf
And the shelf is just filled with disappointing memories
Trends come and go, and your friends wanna know
Why you aren't just happy making crappy little gizmos
Every kid knows they'll just throw this stuff away

We're used to repetition, so we drew up a petition
We, the undersigned, feel undermined
Let's redefine ""employment""

We know that we've got leverage, so we'll hand the fat man a beverage
And sit back while we attack the utter lack of our enjoyment

It may be tough to swallow, but our threats are far from hollow
He may thunder, but if he blunders, he may wonder where the toys went

I make toys, but I've got aspirations
Make some noise, use your imagination
Girls and boys, before you wish for what you wish for
There's a list for who's been
Naughty or nice, but consider the price
Naughty or nice, but consider the price

I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were crying

Summer turned to winter
And the snow, it turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face

And God I hope it's not too late
It's not too late
Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you

And we'll get lost together
Till the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won

When your world's crashing down
And you cannot bear the cross

It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
But you're not

There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart you have remained
And we can fly, fly, fly away

'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to be spy
To see reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two

The whole night through
With the dawn I still go on
Dreamin' of you

You're every thought, you're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn and spring

And were there more than twenty-four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away

When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime, too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

When sky's are grey,
Even when they're blue

How can I?
Get along, without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me

And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

And beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You were in my arms
The nightingale tells it's fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain

Could you be a movie star
When I turn on my TV
Will you smile and wave at me
Tellin' Oprah who you are is strange
So you want to be a rock star
With blue eyed bunny's in your bed
Well remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this
You'll be famous 'cause you're dead

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

I don't want to take you dancing
When you're dancing with the world
Well you can flash your caviar and your million dollar car
I don't need that kind of girl
But you could be that next sensation
Or will you set the latest style
You don't need a catchy song
'Cause the kids will sing along
When you sell it with a smile

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

So don't fly higher, for your fire
Put it in your head
Baby Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself
Keep it on your head Hollywood is dead

Well you can do the mighty tango
You can strut your little thing
You can swing from vine to vine
While the kiddies wait in line
With the money in their hands

But if you get to California
Save a piece of gold for me
If it's the only thing you'll save
Then I'll bet you'll never wave when I watch you on TV

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself

So don't fly higher, for your fire
Put it in your head
Baby Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

Keep on loving what is true and the world will come to you
You can find it in yourself
Love what is true and the world will come to you
You can find it in yourself

As we go along

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, Are you married?
We'll say, No man

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

It can happen to you when you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Michael Bublé,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people are saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

May as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me

In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? what do we do?

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",Alone Again (Naturally),2015

When he breaks your heart to bits

But how the hell can I help it?
When I'm thinkin' on you
Maybe, I might get a little reckless
But you gotta expect that
What else can a boy do?
My momma taught me how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care
'Cause I want you, I need you all for me

Now I don't want anybody loving my baby
Nobody (nobody) nobody (nobody), nobody but me, hey
Now I don't want anybody thinking just maybe
Nobody (nobody) nobody (nobody), nobody but me, hey

And I know when you got a lovely lady
It might drive the boys crazy
When she's looking so fine, woah
I know, know, know that no one would ever blame me
The only thing that could save me
Is just knowing your mine

Don't be cruel but don't be too nice

Hey, we make beautiful music together, how you make my heart sing
Move into the side with us and never be apart thing
Work of art thing, the way you pull me like a harp string
Every moment spent is worth it, that's the perfect part, see
I like whatever you like, we had to do right
And do like, two sovereign nations and try to unite
I'm proud of you, like a treasure, you're the one I'm cherishing
Every other girl is silly, paling in comparison

I know, I get a bit jealous

Far from your shelter, far from your love
Just like a lark in the midnight hour
The song I'm singing is just a sigh

When you're not here the flowers don't blossom
When you're not here I'm lost on an ocean
And the night is long and all is silent
Staring at a star that never shines
When you're not here nothing seems to matter
All hope is gone when you're not around
Helplessly awaiting while my heart is breaking
Everything's blue when you're not around

When you are near me the dawn starts glowing
Bright as a morning beneath the sun
Yours is a love that could move a mountain
And light this laughter when you're around

Michael C. Hall,"I staggered through this criminal reign
I'm not in love, no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace, just a lover's grain
This symphony
This rage in me
I've got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign

I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
And broke and blind
I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
Just killing a little time

I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night, the end of love
Two beating hearts, one labored scarred
One open wound, wasted and drowned
No sympathy
This furious reign

I lay in bed
The monster fed, the body bled
I turned and said
""I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time""
This rage in me
Get away from me

I'm falling, man
I'm choking, man
I'm fading, man
And broke and blind

And the promise to be near each time you call,

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

As we wander through the years
We're told to listen to a voice

That you can't see with your eyes
Is there really any purpose
To this foolish exercise?

Could it be You make Your presence known
So often by Your absence?
Could it be that questions tell us more
Than answers ever do?
Could it be that You would really rather die
Than live without us?
Could it be the only answer that means anything
Is You?

In our pride and in our shame

To the foolish and insane
To the ones who care to seek You
To the ones who never will

That we rob our brothers by all that we own
And that's not the way He has shown

Every time a faithful servant serves

What happens at that moment is a miracle indeed

The noise of what we often say is not worth being heard.
When the Father's wisdom wanted to communicate His love,
He spoke it in one final perfect Word.

He spoke the incarnation, and then so was born a Son.
His final word was Jesus, He needed no other one.
Spoke flesh and blood so He could bleed and make a way Divine.
And so was born a baby who would die to make it mine.

And so the Father's fondest thought became flesh and blood.
He spoke the living luminous word, at once His will was done.
And so the transformation that in man had been unheard,
Took place in God the Father as he spoke that final Word.

And so the Light became alive and manna became Man.
Eternity stepped into time so we could understand.",The Final Word,1987

Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.

And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?",Joy in the Journey,1987
Michael Card,"I thought that I heard crying coming through my door
Was it Rachel weeping for her sons who were no more
Could it have been the babies crying for themselves 
Never understanding that they died for someone else

History speaks of it on every page
Of innocent and helpless little babies 
Offerings to the spirit of the age

No way of understanding this sad and painful sign 
Whenever Satan rears his head, there comes a tragic time
If He could crush the cradle, then that would stop the cross 
He knew that once the Light was born, his every hope was lost

A voice is heard of weeping and of wailing 
History speaks of it on every page
Of innocent and helpless little babies

Now every age has heard it, this voice that speaks from Hell 
Sacrifice your children and for you it will be well
The subtle serpent's lying, his dark and ruthless rage
Behold, it is revealed to be the spirit of the age

A voice is heard of weeping and of wailing 
History speaks of it on every page
Of innocent and helpless little babies 
Offerings to the spirit of the age

Soon all the ones who seemed to die for nothing

Father show me where I fit into this plan of yours
How can a man be father to the Son of God

Upon the cross of Glory

Came down upon His head
It was not for anything He'd done

Soon a circle of glory
Will be placed upon His brow

Will seem only like a dream

Battle before the final war
Blood became tears, there in the garden

And there once the choice had been made
All the world could be saved by the One in the garden

By gentle eyes so sadly wise
The angels appear, they come to the garden
Clothed with sighs, they realize

Don't forsake Him, oh don't pass it by

Come and bear your first burden bravely
Walk so softly upon all the coats and the palms

Michael Card,"How did it feel to take the place
Of honor at the meal?
To take the sup from His own hand
A prophesy to seal?

Was it because He washed your feet
That you sold Him as a slave?
The Son of Man, the Lamb of God
Who'd only come to save

The silver that they paid to you
From out their precious till
Was meant to buy a spotless lamb
A sacrifice to kill

How heavy was the money bag
That couldn't set you free
It became a heavy millstone
As you fell into the sea

Now Judas, don't you come to close
I fear that I might see
That traitor's look upon your face
Might look too much like me

'Cause just like you I've sold the Lord
And often for much less
And like a wretched traitor
I betrayed Him with a kiss

",Traitor's Look,1989
Michael Card,"Why did it have to be a friend
Who chose to betray the Lord
Why did he use a kiss to show them
That's not what a kiss is for

Only a friend can betray a friend
A stranger has nothing to gain
And only a friend comes close enough
To ever cause so much pain

And why did there have to be thorny
Crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one
Made of jewels and gold instead

It had to be a crown of thorns
Because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love
A thorn is all the world has to give

And why did it have to be
A heavy cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands
His love would have held Him there

It was a cross for on a cross
A thief was supposed to pay
And Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

Yes, Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away",Why,1989

Michael Card,"In the early morning mist
They saw a Stranger on the sea shore
He some how seemed familiar
Asking what the night had brought
With taught anticipation then
They listen to His order
And pulling in the net
Found more than they had ever caught
The one He loved first recognized
The stranger there was Jesus
And he alone remembered
This had happened once before
The one who had denied Him
Who had once walked on the water
Jumped in and swam to Him
To be confronted on the shore
Chorus
You need to be confronted
By the Stranger on the shore
You need to have Him search your soul
You need to hear the call
You need to learn exactly
What it means for you to follow
You need to realize that He's asking for your all
The meal He had prepared for them
Was waiting on the fire
The smell of bread
The sizzle of the fish upon the coals
The laughter and the joy
That once more being all together
They didn't realize that He was searching all their souls
Then came the painful questions
That would pierce the soul of Simon
A three fold chance to reaffirm the love he had denied
The gentle eyes that saw his heart
And waited for an answer
Had seen the look upon his face
The moment he had lied

Face and answer all His questions

Michael Card,"On a gray April morning as a chilling wind blew
A thousand dark promises were about to come true
As Satan stood trembling, knowing now he had lost
As the Lamb took his first step on the way to the cross
Chorus
This must be the Lamb
The fulfillment of all God had spoken
This must be the Lamb
Not a single bone will be broken
Like a sheep to the slaughter
So silently still
This must be the Lamb
They mocked his true calling and laughed at His fate
So glad to see the Gentle One consumed by their hate
Unaware of the wind and the darkening sky
So blind to the fact that it was God limping by

Trembling in fear there at the foot of the cross
Tormented by memories that came like a flood
Unaware that their pardon

Where's the Child who was here only yesterday
How my heart start to beat as I sat at His feet
For the things He'd say
The questions I asked Him
Had weighed on my mind an eternity
But the self-righteous show
I had made my disguise
It started to slip as I looked in His eyes
So rather than stay, for my pride sake
I walked away
Chorus
Come listen awhile to the voice of a Child
Stand in awe of the wisdom of God
Hear what He has to say
For the time is today
You can come or just walk away
Then late in the night I awoke to a voice
Deep inside of me
It was gentle and mild like the voice of a child
My mind's eye could see
It spoke of the promises
Made to my people through Abraham
And at once all the prophesy made sense to me
I'd studied them so long
Why couldn't I see
In one holy moment I knew the Messiah was He

Whose frightened tears would free us all from fear

The marks of death that God chose never to erase
The wounds of loves eternal war
When the kingdom comes with its perfected sons
He will be known by the scars
For a time He sought to tell the world He was the Way
That God the father had a human heart
With His own holy hands He sought
To touch and heal their scars
But they chose to tear those gentle hands apart
What was there to wipe away the tears
Firm the holy eyes of God
As He looked upon His one and only Son
Who never sinned, nor lied, yet was crucified

Michael Card,"Why did it have to be a friend
Who chose to betray the Lord
Why did he use a kiss to show them
That's not what a kiss is for

Only a friend can betray a friend
A stranger has nothing to gain
And only a friend comes close enough
To ever cause so much pain

And why did there have to be thorny
Crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one
Made of jewels and gold instead

It had to be a crown of thorns
Because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love
A thorn is all the world has to give

And why did it have to be
A heavy cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands
His love would have held Him there

It was a cross for on a cross
A thief was supposed to pay
And Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

Yes, Jesus had come into the world
To steal every heart away

Dragged to the court, no hope of salvation
All hope was lost for those who had caught me
Knew what I was, they knew all about me

I thought it seemed strange as we entered in
They stopped a young rabbi to ask his opinion
Caught in the act, their reason for hating
My body could feel the stones that were waiting

My judge, a man from Galilee
In His eyes so gentle I could see
A father and a brother and a son

Just as I saw Him, the hope I had lost became born again
I was not hopeless, though I'd been lost
Now, I felt I was found when He looked at me
With His forgiving eyes

The crowd gathered round, so angry and violent
But He stood beside me, peaceful and silent
Then with a word, with one question, He showed them
That they too were guilty and could not condemn

The next thing I knew, He asked me, ""Where are they?""
And I looked around the courtyard was empty
The stones scattered 'round, the warm morning sunlight
He'd made the darkness perfectly light

In this new light now I understood
He would not condemn me though He could
For He would be condemned someday for me

Their only choice, their only hope
Would he be heard
Their only way they might be saved
Would he be heard

The Final Priest did come
And He offered up a living sacrifice
Now we His children wait for Him
With hope and joyful praise
For we know that God has heard Him
For we know that He was raised
He offered cheerful praise and He was heard
He offered up His life and He was heard

Michael Carpenter,"I love to see the cottonwood blossom
In the early spring
I love to see the message of love
That the bluebird brings

But when I see you walkin' with him
Down along the strand
I wish I were blind
When I see you with your man

I love to see your hair shining
In the long summer's light
I love to watch the stars fill the sky
On a summer night

The music plays you take his hand
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance
And I wish I were blind
When I see you with your man

We struggle here but all our love's in vain
And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty
Now fill me with pain
And the light that once entered here
Is banished from me
And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees

And though the world is filled
With the grace and beauty of God's hand
Oh I wish I were blind
When I see you with your man",I Wish I Were Blind,2001
Michael Carpenter,"Oh yeah, oh yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many many many times before

You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone 

If I had some more time to spend

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this

Michael Carvin,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1988
Michael Carvin,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Michael Carvin,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Michael Carvin,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1992
Michael Carvin,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2006

Michael Cavadias,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day

Michael Cavanaugh,"Oh baby
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin'
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think out of line, here baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts the burnin'
And the thrill of your touch give me fright
I'm shakin' so much, really yearnin'
Why don't you show up and make it alright
Yeah, it's alright

And if you promise your love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
Whatever happened to you?

And you thought it was only in movies
And you wish all your dreams would come true, hey
It ain't the first time, believe me, baby
I'm standin' here feelin' blue, oh, yes I'm blue

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes, no longer, and then I'm turnin' around round

And the clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Has lotted the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Love (or ""Oh"") that I found

Hey baby, c'mon
I feel somewhere, and I'll drive no more

I feel this rain pouring down on me
Got to get home, yeah, get home

Oh now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the ring till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I run till I drop, hey

I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block

As you're walkin', out the door
The months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for

Some times, just for a moment,
I reach out, hope you're still there

Miles away,
No, you're never turnin' back,
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away,
Nothin' left of what we had,
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away

It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too

If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

With only your promises

Thoughts of you, just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
