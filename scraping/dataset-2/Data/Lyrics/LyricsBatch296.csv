Generation X,"What's it like to play a part? 
What's it like to have a wooden heart? 
Every word you say is so rehearsed 
You think your clothes and actions control the universe 

Listen, what you'd better do 
Listen, better change your head 
Listen, or there's nothing we can do 
Listen to the one who will change your world 

You're the face upon a playing card 
A colored painted cold visage 
(You're) just a pawn of somebody somewhere 
Only trouble is you're gonna get no-where 

Listen, what you'd better do 
Listen, better change your head 
Listen, or there's nothing we can do 
Listen to the one who will change your world 

What's it like to play a part? 
(You) got a wooden heart 
(You're) just a puppet on a string 
A nothing, a no-one, no style 
(You) just play a part 
(You're) just a pawn of someone somewhere 
And you'll get no-where 

Listen what you'd better do 
Listen, better change your head 
Listen, or there's nothing we can do 
Listen to the one who will change your world 
Gonna change your world

Generation X,"The first last? lot make a few mistakes 
They didn't die young, they got big waists 
We got let down at the back of Earls Court 
And swear that night we'd never get caught 
'cause we were smarter than they were (they were) 

We started out with guitars and hate 
With our rooms in the clouds we could hardly wait 
Our legs apart, our amps up high 
The stage caught fire (then?) the charts blew up 
And we play more than they do (they do) 

Promises Promises 
Do you remember the promises promises, I do
Do you remember the promises promises, I do

We made our shirts with sprays and knives 
Then we saved up for weeks for Malcolm's strides 
Our hair was short we said what we thought 
We'd never be scared [we'd] never be bought 
Never sell out like they did, they did 

Promises Promises 
Do you remember the promises promises, I do
Do you remember the promises promises, I do

Soon you'll get your gear form Marks and Sparks 
Punk'll take over Top of the Pops 
Think you're having a real cool time? 
Watch out kid you're next in line, oh yeah 

Do you remember the promises promises, I do
Do you remember the promises promises, I do

Where were you in '75 
When there weren't no gigs and we were jive 
(Promises promises promises remember) 
No one gave a shit for our Rock'n'Roll dream 
Are men laughed re-release the Cream 
(Promises promises promises remember) 
And they thought we were stupid 
And they thought we were stupid 
And we promised we'd get back get back 
Do you remember the Promises Promises 
Do you remember the Promises Promises

I do, I do, I do, what I do, what I do

You're to to to too personal 

Well you keep talking about love,
Well what do you want 
We have fun alright, so what do you want 
The idea of fate its all in the mind 
We are the ones who control our own time 

Look don't get me wrong 
But if you keep on I'm gonna go 

You're to to to too personal 
You're to to to too personal 

You say everyone's lonely and insecure 
All because of living in hate and fear 
Well if love is possession baby you better change 
No one's gonna keep me in those chains

I think we'd spoken
I think we'd spoken once before

Started engines of desire

Of stopping love,

I felt so good when she was there

You get burnt by

And I know I'm in control

Generation X,"A sixteen hundred, packed with angry young men
Came burning down main street
I touched the Epiphone that hung on my hip
It knew the sound of my heartbeat

But turning the corner in a twisted heap
They pulled some bodies from an upturned Ford
Some kid looked at me and said, it's only life
Might as well use it while we're young
Might as well use it while we're young

I queued with some friends outside the ABC One
To see the killer with no name
Yeah, De Niro's so great, and you know last week
I saw the universe in flames

But it's always the same like Citizen Kane
Ya end up with nothing and you leave for home
Talking and kicking coke cans in the street
As Fu Manchu looks on
As Fu Manchu looks on

And I thought they must think I'm crazy
The things I'll see for fun
Then in my mind I saw the enemy
And I wasted him with my gun

I thought of my brother working Heathrow
Flying engines in the night
Learning every part, he'll be through in years
When I'm signed on for life

Lying here, waiting for a hero to rise
But a lazy man lies back instead
No one hears the young man when he's alone
Planning to kill someone
Planning to kill someone

And I thought it must be me who's crazy
The things I'll do for fun
Choosing poison to get to paradise

Without prompting she goes into her rap: ""This is the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging, those you are about to see are all in for servicing, except for a small quantity of our new product, in the second gallery. It is all the stock required to cover the existing arrangements of the enterprise. Different batches are distributed to area operators, and there are plenty of opportunities for the large investor. They stretch from the costly care-conditioned to the most reasonable mal-nutritioned. We find here that everyone's looks become them. Except for the low market mal-nutritioned, each is provided with a guarantee for a successful birth and trouble free infancy. There is however only a small amount of variable choice potential - not too far from the mean differential. You see, the roof has predetermined the limits of ac

Ocean winds blow on the land.
The Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It's the same old ending-time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Metal motion comes in bursts,
But the gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road

And out on the subway,
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.

Genesis,"The scent grows richer, he knows he must be near,
He finds a long passageway lit by chandelier.
Each step he takes, the perfumes change
From familiar fragrance to flavors strange.
A magnificent chamber meets his eye.

Inside, a long rose-water pool is shrouded by fine mist.
Stepping in the moist silence, with a warm breeze he's gently kissed.

Thinking he is quite alone,
He enters the room, as if it were his own,
But ripples on the sweet pink water
Reveal some company unthought of

Rael stands astonished doubting his sight,
Struck by beauty, gripped in fright;
Three vermilion snakes of female face,
The smallest motion, filled with grace.
Muted melodies fill the echoing hall,
But there is no sign of warning in the siren's call:
""Rael welcome, we are the Lamia of the pool.
We have been waiting for our waters to bring you cool.""

Putting fear beside him, he trusts in beauty blind,
He slips into the nectar, leaving his shredded clothes behind.
""With their tongues, they test, taste and judge all that is mine.
They move in a series of caresses
That glide up and down my spine.

As they nibble the fruit of my flesh, I feel no pain,
Only a magic that a name would stain.
With the first drop of my blood in their veins
Their faces are convulsed in mortal pains.
The fairest cries, 'We all have loved you Rael'.""

Silent sorrow in empty boats.
A sickly sourness fills the room,
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom.

He meets a sense of yesteryear.
A window in the bank above his head
Reveals his home amidst the streets.

The smell of acid on his gun of paint.
As it carves out anger in a blood-red band,
Destroyed tomorrow by an unknown hand;
My home.
Is this the way out from this endless scene?
Or just an entrance to another dream?
And the light dies down on Broadway.

But as the skylight beckons him to leave,
He hears a scream fro far below.
Within the raging water, writhes the form
Of brother John, he cries for help.

The gate is fading now, but open wide,
But John is drowning, I must decide
Between the freedom I had in the rat-race,
Or to stay forever in this forsaken place;

Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning
Come see me take my hand
Come see me in my land
Flying invisibly high, watch me
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreased
Come see me take my hand
Come see me in my land
High on a golden crested wave she sits
The little nymphs dance in her hair
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives
Horizons come to sip wine there
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef
The albatross flies to the stern
And only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return
Crossing the mountains of truth see them
Soaring majestically high, and then
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly
Thunder awakes me, it crashes beside me
Shatter the scene and bring chaos to beauty
Leading me forward where destiny may be
Come see me take my hand
View from another land

Still sitting there, 
Wonder if they're late for church 
And it's cold, so they fasten their coats 
And cross the grass, they're always last. 

Passing by the padlocked swings, 
The roundabout still turning, 
Ahead they see a small girl 
On her way home with a pram. 

Inside the archway, 
The priest greets them with a courteous nod. 
He's close to God. 
Looking back at days of four instead of two. 
Years seem so few (four instead of two).

Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child;

As the dawn creeps up the sky 
The hunter caught sight of a doe. 
In desire for conquest, 
He found himself within a glade he'd not beheld before.

""Where are you, my father? 
Give wisdom to your son""

""The waters are disturbed 
Some creature has been stirred"" 
    Narrator: 
""The waters are disturbed

As he rushed to quench his thirst, 
A fountain spring appeared before him 
And as his heated breath brushed through the cool mist, 
A liquid voice called, ""Son of gods, drink from my spring"". 

The water tasted strangely sweet. 
Behind him the voice called again. 
He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone 
And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake. 

   Salmacis: 
""We shall be one 
We shall be joined as one"" 
   Narrator: 
""She wanted them as one 
Yet he had no desire to be one""

""Away from me cold-blooded woman 
Your thirst is not mine"" 

   Salmacis: 
""Nothing will cause us to part 
Hear me, O Gods"" 

Unearthly calm descended from the sky 
And then their flesh and bones were strangely merged 
Forever to be joined as one. 

The creature crawled into the lake. 
A fading voice was heard: 
""And I beg, yes I beg that all who touch this spring 
May share my fate""

""We are the one 
We are the one""

Genesis,"Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one.
His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,
I am he, the chosen one.

In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,
But they'll fight the battle on.

Then one whose faith had died
Fled back up the mountainside,
But before the top was made,
A misplaced footfall made him stray
From the path prepared for him.
Off of the mountain,
On to a wilderness of ice.

This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.
Terror filled their minds with awe.

Simple were the folk who lived
Upon this frozen wave.
So not surprising was their thought,
This is he, God's chosen one,
Who's come to save us from
All our oppressors.
We shall be kings on this world.

Follow me!
I'll play the game you want me,
Until I find a way back home.

Follow me!
I give you strength inside you,
Courage to win your battles

No, no, no, this can't go on,
This will be all that I fled from.
Let me rest for a while.

He walked into a valley,
All alone.
There he talked with water, and then with the vine.

They leave me no choice.
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.

They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.
Still he urged the people on.

Then, on a distant slope,
He observed one without hope
Flee back up the mountainside.
He thought he recognized him by his walk,
And by the way he fell,
And by the way he
Stood up, and vanished into air",One for the Vine [DVD],1976

Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But as least the seeds of love will be sown
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand

Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !
What's your problem ? What's your curse ?
Won't it make the matter worse ?
In my head...
And they say "" Faith can move move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul ""
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter - No !

When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day

When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin drawn between friend and foe

Couldn't even lift a sword.
Dressed too fine and smelling of wine.

Daddy you've got to go!
Here come the bishop all dressed up
He's gonna bless you if you're ready to pay
One wave of his funny old stick,
There's a band of light across your eyes.

Waited a week still they hadn't appeared,
That glorious timing that everyone feared.
So they're riding along on the crest of a wave,
They're headed for London, And that will be their grave
Eleventh Earl of Mar
Well he couldn't get them down that far
Daddy! I'm waiting, I'm waiting

Time to go to bed now
Never seems too keen
To be a guest now
In a house of dreams

Flying from a hillside
Beckoning the trees
A sailboat's awning
Mimicking the breeze

I'm fighting gravity falling
My Daddy won't let them get me
A voice screams seems to be calling
The face turns features are burning.

Daddy, you've got to go!
See the fifteen going by,
Tell the Lairds and the Lords
They're running backwards today,
And once again you stand alone.

Bury your memories bury your friends,
Leave it alone for a year or two.
Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true,
Then do it again. Some Things never end.
Eleventh Earl of Mar
Won't be going very far.
You Promised, You Promised, You Promised.

Genesis,"I got sunshine in my stomach
Like I just rocked my baby to sleep.
I got sunshine in my stomach
But I can't keep me from creeping sleep,
Sleep, deep in the deep.
  
He wakes in a cold sweat with a strong urge to vomit. There's no sign of the cocoon and he can see more of the cave about him. There is much more of the glowing water dripping from the roof and stalactites and stalagmites are forming and decomposing at an alarming rate all around him. 
 
Rockface moves to press my skin
White liquid turn sour within
Turn fast - turn sour
Turn sweat - turn sour.
Must tell myself that I'm not here.
I'm drowning in a liquid fear.
Bottled in a strong compression,
My distortion shows obsession
In the cave.
Get me out of this cave!
 
As fear and shock register, he assures himself that self-control will provide some security, but this thought is abandoned as the stalactites and stalagmites lock into a fixed position, forming a cage whose bars are moving in towards him. 
 
If I keep my self-control,
I'll be safe in my soul.
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief,
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns.
My spirit just never learns.
 
Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight.
Lips are dry, throat is dry.
Feel like burning, stomach churning,
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room.
Body stretching, feel the wretching
In the cage
Get me out of the cage!
 
At one moment there is a flash of light and he sees an infinite network of cages all strung together by a ropelike material. 
 
In the glare of a light,
I see a strange kind of sight;
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings,
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.
 
As the rocky bars press in on Rael's body, he sees his brother John outside, looking in. John's face is motionless despite screams for help, but in his vacant expression a tear of blood forms and trickles down his cheek. Then he calmly walks away leaving Rael to face the pains which are beginning to sweep through his body. 
 
Outside the cage I see my Brother John,
He turns his head so slowly round.
I cry out Help! before he can be gone,
And he looks at me without a sound.
And I shout out 'John please help me!'
But he does not even want to try to speak.
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek,
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage.
My little runaway.
 
(Raindrops keep failing on my head, they keep falling on my)
 
In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still. Pinned for kill.
Chances narrow that I'll make it,
In the cushioned straight-jacket.
Just like 22nd Street,
They got me by my neck and feet.
Pressures building, can't take more.
My headaches charge, earaches roar.
In this pain
Get me out of this pain.
 
If I could change to liquid,
I could fill the cracks up in the rocks.
I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck.
 
However, just as John walks out of sight, the cage dissolves and Rael is left spinning like a top. 
 
Outside John disappears, my cage dissolves,
without any reason my body revolves.
 
Keep on turning,
Keep on turning,
Turning around,
Spinning around.

Genesis,"The man steps out in the moonlight
At the sound of a scream from below.
He thinks he is a warrior
So he picks up his sword and goes.

From the mouth of the monster
He rescues the maiden fair.
But we know shes a demon
Come to lure him to demons lair.

Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads
To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she calls home.

Come with me, I need you,
I fear the dark and I live all alone.
Ill give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like.

And though his body bids him
To enter in with her,
There was something in her manner
That his mind could not ignore.

Also it is whispered
In the kingdom far and wide,
To beware a little cottage
In the forest in a glade.

For who knows what magic takes place in his world? 
So he just thanks her kindly preparing to go on his way.

Come with me, I need you,
I fear the dark and I live all alone.
Ill give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like.

Come to my garden,
Taste the fruits and the spices of love.
You cant resist me,
I'm the kind that your dreams tell you of.

So glad you could make it
We had everything arranged.
So glad you saw fit to pay a call.

Some men never listen,
And others never learn,
But why this man did as he did
Only he will ever know.

He knew he was walking
Into a waiting trap,
Neatly set up for him
With a bait so richly wrapped.

So he went inside there to take on what he found
But he never escaped them, for who can escape what he desires? 

Come with me, I need you,
I fear the dark and I live all alone.
I'll give you wine and food too

Genesis,"Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one.
His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,
I am he, the chosen one.

In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,
But they'll fight the battle on.

Then one whose faith had died
Fled back up the mountainside,
But before the top was made,
A misplaced footfall made him stray
From the path prepared for him.
Off of the mountain,
On to a wilderness of ice.

This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.
Terror filled their minds with awe.

Simple were the folk who lived
Upon this frozen wave.
So not surprising was their thought,
This is he, God's chosen one,
Who's come to save us from
All our oppressors.
We shall be kings on this world.

Follow me!
I'll play the game you want me,
Until I find a way back home.

Follow me!
I give you strength inside you,
Courage to win your battles -

No, no, no, this can't go on,
This will be all that I fled from.
Let me rest for a while.

He walked into a valley,
All alone.
There he talked with water, and then with the vine.

They leave me no choice.
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.

They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.
Still he urged the people on.

Then, on a distant slope,
He observed one without hope
Flee back up the mountainside.
He thought he recognized him by his walk,
And by the way he fell,
And by the way he
Stood up, and vanished into air",One for the Vine,1978

They got pretty blue eyes
For an hour a man may change
For an hour her face looks strange
Looks strange, looks strange

Marching to the promised land
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand
Pulls you down on your knees
While you're down a pool appears
The face in the water looks up
And she shakes her head as if to say
That it's the last time you'll look like today

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
Gone to the other side
Sail away, sail away

Is sinking fast, that happens you know

Lovelier she was than any that I know

Angels never know it's time
To close the book and gracefully decline
The song has found a tale
My, what a jealous pool she is
The face in the water looks up
She shakes her head as if to say
That the blue girls have all gone away

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back

To blow on the glass so I know I'm alive

No way in no way out.
Then my friends can visit me
Once in a while.

Ooh I'm just a busy bee, still alone in my hive,
I'm looking for some other world

And nothing and no one will ever know.

Sun baked earth that's cooled by gentle breeze
And trees with rustling leaves
Only endless days without a care
Nothing must be done

Silent as a day can be
Far off sounds of others on their chosen run
As they do all those things they feel give life some meaning
Even if they're dull

Time to stop this dreaming, must rejoin the real world
As revealed by orange lights and a smoky atmosphere

The trees and I are shaken by the same winds but whereas
The trees will lose their withered leaves
I just can't seem to let them loose
And they can't refresh me those hot winds of the south
Feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place

Now the light id fading fast
Chances slip away, a time will come to pass
When there'll be none
Then addicted to a perfumed poison
Betrayed by its aftertaste
We shall lose the wonder and find nothing in return
Many are the substitutes but they're powerless an their own

Beware the fisherman who's casting out his line
Into a dried up river bed
But don't try to tell him 'cause he won't believe you
Throw some bread to the ducks instead, it's easier that way

About her music, it all seemed so important then,

Everyone would cry for more,
That all she had to do was step into the light,
And everyone would start to roar.
 
And on the road,
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,
She battled through
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.

Soon all she had to do was step into the light,
For everyone to start to roar.
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.

It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.
Yes times were hard,
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.

When nobody called for more
And soon everytime she stepped into the light,

Genesis,"Ma would never say what happened
And we knew better than push too hard
We knew we had all the chores to tend to
Like fixing fences and helping her

Washing dishes and making coffee
Me and Virgil'd chop some wood
But we'd stop our swinging
Just to listen to her crying

It didn't sound too good
I can remember, too well
 
But we never thought to pay much heed
We learned to live life the best we could
But then one day pa upped and left us
High and dry without a word

Seemed a pity
My ma was pretty
But I soon learned life ain't that way
And I can remember hearing her weeping
While we were sleeping next to her
 
I can remember 
I'll never forgive and I'll never forget
'Cause pa you broke her heart
Ooh pa you broke her heart
You broke her heart
Ooh pa you broke her heart
 
Well the years rolled by
And 'fore we knew it
Our sister got married and moved out west
I stayed with ma, 'cause I couldn't desert her

I knew it would hurt her to be alone
So we pulled tighter
We said we'd try to make things easy
And raise a smile

But as the night came
We'd hear her crying
Praying for pa to come back again
 
I can remember
I'll never forgive him and I'll never forget
'Cause pa you broke her heart
Oh pa you broke her heart
 
And then the winter came
I'd never known it colder
Ooh it seemed the worst for years
And the night she died I swear I saw her smiling
Saying I was a big boy now, no tears
 
So I packed up all we had, and Virgil got the horses
And we paid our last respects and gave the whip a crack
Ooh, seemed a big bad world, we were riding into
Me and Virgil both agreed, we best head off
And don't look back
 
Nothing but desert all around
Oh it made me wonder
Lord it's hard to carry on
When you're sick with hunger
 
Weeks and months of sleeping rough
Keeping clear of danger
Seems we were miles from anywhere
And too far gone to change it
We'd best keep going, don't look back
 
Well me and Virgil we beat the desert
Riding fast and riding hard
We hit the city, the past behind us
So we raised some hell, we had some fun
But real soon I met a lady oh so pretty, and oh so fine

With a home of my own and a blue eyed son
And 'til this day I can hear ma saying to me -

Sleep, deep in the deep.
 
 
He wakes in a cold sweat with a strong urge to vomit. There's no sign of the cocoon and he can see more of the cave about him. There is much more of the glowing water dripping from the roof and stalactites and stalagmites are forming and decomposing at an alarming rate all around him. 
 
Rockface moves to press my skin
White liquid turn sour within
Turn fast - turn sour
Turn sweat - turn sour.
Must tell myself that I'm not here.
I'm drowning in a liquid fear.
Bottled in a strong compression,
My distortion shows obsession
In the cave.
Get me out of this cave!
 
As fear and shock register, he assures himself that self-control will provide some security, but this thought is abandoned as the stalactites and stalagmites lock into a fixed position, forming a cage whose bars are moving in towards him. 
 
If I keep my self-control,
I'll be safe in my soul.
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief,
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns.
My spirit just never learns.
 
Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight.
Lips are dry, throat is dry.
Feel like burning, stomach churning,
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room.
Body stretching, feel the retching
In the cage
Get me out of the cage!
 
At one moment there is a flash of light and he sees an infinite network of cages all strung together by a ropelike material. 
 
In the glare of a light,
I see a strange kind of sight;
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings,
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.
 
As the rocky bars press in on Rael's body, he sees his brother John outside, looking in. John's face is motionless despite screams for help, but in his vacant expression a tear of blood forms and trickles down his cheek. Then he calmly walks away leaving Rael to face the pains which are beginning to sweep through his body. 
 
Outside the cage I see my Brother John,
He turns his head so slowly round.
I cry out Help! before he can be gone,
And he looks at me without a sound.
And I shout out 'John please help me!'
But he does not even want to try to speak.
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek,
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage.
My little runaway.
 
(Raindrops keep failing on my head, they keep falling on my...)
 
In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still. Pinned for kill.
Chances narrow that I'll make it,
In the cushioned straight-jacket.
Just like 22nd Street,
They got me by my neck and feet.
Pressures building, can't take more.
My headaches charge, earaches roar.
In this pain
Get me out of this pain.
 
If I could change to liquid,
I could fill the cracks up in the rocks.
I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck.
 
However, just as John walks out of sight, the cage dissolves and Rael is left spinning like a top. 
 
Outside John disappears, my cage dissolves,
without any reason my body revolves.
 
Keep on turning,
Keep on turning,
Turning around,
spinning around.

Genesis,"I am the one who guided you this far
All you know and all you feel
Nobody must know my name
For nobody would understand

Genesis,"Mad Man Moon
Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon.",Mad Man Moon,1987
Genesis,"Creeping up the blind side, shinning up the wall
Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Coming out the woodwork, through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows without substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sign and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Sit down, sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Sit down, sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Sit down sit down
Cause you won't get away
So with us you will stay
For the rest of your days. so sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Yes times were hard,

In search of another to share in his life.

Leaving by the same door from which he had come in, 
He finds some sort of freaks ghetto on the other side. 
When they catch sight of him, the entire street of distorted figures burst into laughter. 
One of the colony approaches him. 

[Rael] 
I wandered lonely as a cloud,
Till I came upon this dirty street.
I've never seen a stranger crowd;
Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet,
Continually pacing,
With nonchalant embracing,
Each orifice disgracing
And one facing me moves to say ""hellay"".

He is grotesque in every feature, a mixture of ugly lumps and stumps. 
His lips slip across his chin as he smiles in welcome and offers his slippery handshake. 
His skin`s all covered in slimy lumps.
With lips that slide across each chin.

His twisted limbs like rubber stumps
Are waved in welcome say `Please join in.`
My grip must be flipping,
'Cause his handshake keeps slipping,
My hopes keep on dipping
And his lips keep on smiling all the time.

Rael is a little disillusioned, 
When the Slipperman reveals that the entire colony have one-by-one been through 
The same glorious romantic tragedy with the same three Lamia, 
Who regenerate themselves every time, 
And that now Rael shares their physical appearance and shadowy fate. 

[Slipperman] 
""We, like you, have tasted love.
Don`t be alarmed at what you see,
You yourself are just the same
As what you see in me.""

Rael: 
Me, like you? like that!

Slipperman: 
""You better watch it son, your sentence has only just begun
You better run and join your brother John.""

Amongst the contorted faces of the Slippermen, 
Rael recognizes what is left of his brother John. T
Hey hug each other. 
A Visit To The Doktor 

John bitterly explains that the entire life of the Slipperman 
Is devoted to satisfying the never-ending hunger of the senses, 
Which has been inherited from the Lamia. 
There is only one escape route; a dreaded visit to the notorious Doktor Dyper 

Who will remove the source of the problems, or to put it less politely, castrate. 
They discuss the deceptively-named escape for a long time 
And decide to go together to visit the Doktor. 

[Slipperman] 
""You`re in the colony of slippermen.
There`s no who? why? what? or when?
You get out if you`ve got the gripe
To see, Doktor Dyper, reformed sniper - he`ll whip off your
Windscreenwiper""

[Rael]
John and I are able
To face the Doktor and his marble table.

The Doktor: 
Understand Rael, that`s the end of your tail.

Rael: 
""Don`t delay, dock the dick!""
I watch his countdown timer tick....

The Raven 
They survive the ordeal and are presented with the offensive weapons in sterile yellow plastic tubes, with gold chains. ""People usually wear them around their necks,"" said the Doktor handing them over. ""The operation does not necessarily exclude use of the facility again, for short periods, but of course when you want it you must provide us with considerable advance warning."" 

He places the number into a tube,
It`s a yellow plastic ""shoobedoobe"".
It says: ""Though your fingers may tickle
You`ll be safe in our pickle.""

As the brothers talk themselves through their new predicament, a big black raven flies into the cave, swoops down, grabs Rael`s tube right out of his hands and carries it up into the air in his beak. 
Suddenly, black cloud come down from the sky.
It`s a supersized black bird that sure can fly...
The raven brings on darkness and night
He flies right down, gives me one hell of a fright.
He take the tube right out of my hands
Man, I`ve got to find out where that black bird lands.

Rael calls for John to go with him. 
And he replies ""I will not chase a black raven. Down here you must read and obey the omens. There`s disaster where the raven flies."" 

""Look here John, I`ve got to run
I need you now, you going to come?""
He says to me:

John: 
""Now can`t you see
Where the raven flies there`s jeopardy.
We`ve been cured on the couch
Now you`re sick with your grouch.
I`ll not risk my honey pouch
Which my slouch will wear slung very low.""

So once more John deserts his brother. 
Rael: 
He walks away and leaves me once again.
Even though I never learn,
I`d hoped he`d show just some concern.

The bird leads Rael down a narrow tunnel, he seems to be allowing him to keep at a closed distance. But as Rael thinks he might almost catch hold of the bird, the tunnel opens and finishes at an enormous subterranean ravine. Casually, the raven drops his precious load into the rushing waters at the bottom. It`s enough to drive a poor boy ravin` mad. 
Seeing the dangers of the steep cliff, our courageous hero stands impotent and glowers. 

I`m in the agony of Slipperpain
I pray my undercarriage will sustain.
The chase is on, the pace is hot
But I`m running so very hard with everything that I`ve got.
He leads me down an underpass
Though it narrows, he still flies very fast,
When the tunnel stops
Catch sight of the tube, just as it drops.
I`m on top of a bank too steep to climb
I see it hit the water just in time
To watch it float away...",The Colony of Slippermen,1992
Genesis,"Leaving my family behind me
Not knowing what lay ahead
Waving goodbye, as I left them in tears
Remembering all we'd said

I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers
I asked Him for guidance and strength
But the simple beliefs of a simple man
Lay in His hands, and on my head
My head

I gave everything that they wanted
But still they wanted more
We sweat and we toiled
Good men lost their lives
I don't think they knew what for

I sold them my heart
I sold them my soul
I gave everything I had
But they couldn't break my spirit
My dignity fought back
Fightback
Just fightback

Can you hear me
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Don't you see

We worked in gangs for all we were worth
The young boys pulling the wagons
We were digging the tunnels, shifting the earth
It was then that it happened

No-one knew how the cracks appeared
But as it fell they all disappeared
Stone fell like rain

Can you hear me
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Can you breathe

The smoke cleared, the dust it settled
No one knew how many had died
All around there were broken men
They'd said it was safe, and they'd lied
You could hear the cries, you could smell the fear
But good fortune that day was mine
And it occurred to me that the heart of a good man
It seems is hard to find

Can you hear me
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Don't you see
How we worked, how we worked like
The devil for our pay
Through the wind, through the snow
And through the rain

Blasting and cutting through Gods country like a knife
Sweat stinging my eyes, there has to be a better life

But I can hear my children's cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Memories of those I've left behind
Oh just still ringing in my ears
Will I ever go back again
Will I ever see her face again
'cause I'll always remember that night
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We came from the North
And we came from the South
With picks and with spades
And a new kind of order
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
They'll never see the likes of us again

Driving the last spike
Lifting and laying the track
With blistering hands
And the sun burning your back

But I can hear my children's cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Oh memories of those I've left behind
Still ringing in my ears
'cause I'll always remember that night
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We followed the rail, we slept under the stars
Digging in darkness and living with danger
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
They'll never see the likes of us again

Genesis,"Another time it might have been so different
If only we could do it all again
But now it's just another fading memory
Out of focus, though the outline still remains

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember

Like the story that we wish was never ending
We know sometime we must reach the final page
Still we carry on just pretending
That there'll always be another day to go

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember

Another chance hello, another goodbye
And so many things we'll never see again

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Coming out of the woodwork
Through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance
In the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction
Eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sign and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long, undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit, down, sit down
As we relive our lives 
In what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer
Longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance
Photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
'Cause living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

I will now receive my comfort
Conjured by the magic power of wine

Just a drink to take my sorrow
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again
Now I'm down

When I walk outside, there is nowhere
Children follow me with their laughter, so cold

Casting just a glance at the churchyard
Casting just a glance at my painted female friend

Now I'm on my way, I am falling
Got to find some help, ooh, I will need that now

So I will receive my comfort
Conjured by the magic power of wine

Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine

Just a drink to take my sorrow
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again
Now I'm down

I will now receive my comfort
Conjured by the magic power of wine

Your eyes are frozen with guilt
I read my fate on your cheeks
The smoldering coals of a passion once a meadow of hope

Days of minstrels and bright steeds
Autumn nights and silk sheets
Your tender battle shadow on me scented lavender kisses, soft and warm
The union of strength in a love against life, love against life

Pacidy, my love your touch, so limp, was once frenzied
Your argon lips were once sweet
A life has slipped through my hands
My spirits sift in a stale sigh, did love exist as a dream?

Mother fawn of a pine wood shepherdess of my grief
Veils a freedom not for me
Far beyond the steep ridge, where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts, frailest of beasts

Where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts, frailest of beasts
Where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts, frailest of beasts

It's only at the turning point
That you find out how you fight

In the cold, feel the cold all around
And the rush of crashing water
Surrounds me with its sound

Striking out to reach you
I can't get through to the other side
When you're racing in the rapids
There's only one way that's to ride

Taken down, taken down by the undertow
And I'm spiraled down the river bed
My fire is burning low

Catching hold of the rock that's firm
I'm waiting for John to be carried past
We hold together, hold together and shoot the rapids fast

When the waters slow down
The dark and the deep
Have no one, no one, no one, no one
No one left to keep

Hang on John, we're out of this at last
Somethings changed that's not your face
It's mine, it's mine

Chewing through the Wimpy dreams
They eat without a sound
Digesting England by the pound

Laying out the credit cards she plays Fortune
The deck is uneven right from the start
All of their hands are playing apart

Genesis,"Rise up, take your lyre and sing
Listen, to the news I bring

Frosty breath on the window
See a friend in the snow that gently falls
Feel the truth in those sad eyes
See the smile that's so rare just like the love, she waits for

And she plays a game of her own
As she sleeps within the firelight
For her dreams are incredibly wild
But they're lost and gone forever with the dawn

Fair and friend of the fleece spoke
Warrior bold, shepherd wise, fair Prince of Peace
Someone waits in the doorway
On a white horse, he comes and holds out the hand, she waits for

So they ride through a valley of mist
To a castle in the Heavens
Where he lays her down to rest
But he's lost and gone forever with the dawn

See her writhe in her dream, then

Mermaids sing in the sunset
Sadly asking if beauty ever walks free
But Queen Frost only whispers
Maidens you will remain to be free

See her writhe in her dreams

Genesis,"To Thomas S. Eiselberg, a very rich man
Who was wise enough to spend all his fortunes
In burying himself many miles beneath the ground
As the only surviving member of the human race
He inherited the whole world

Here today the red sky tells his tale
But the only listening eyes are mine
There is peace amongst the hills
And the night will cover all my pride

Blest are they who smile from bodies free
Seems to me like any other crowd
Who are waiting to be saved

Wait, there still is time for washing in the pool
Wash away the past
Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above
Smiling at my tears

Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home
Keep outside the night
The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead somehow

And each will find a home
And there will still be time
For loving my friend, you are there

And I will wait for ever
Beside the silent mirror
And fish for bitter minnows
Amongst the weeds and slimy water

I, I said, I want to sit down
I, I said, I want to sit down
I want a drink, I want a drink
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat

I want a drink, I want a drink
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts
I want a drink

Then let us drink, then let us smile
Then let us go

Just watching you

Seems a very stupid game
But I don't care

Happy the man
He doesn't buzz around
Nothing he wants
More than anything

Where you go, where?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere

With a grin on my chin
I'm certain to win

When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench,
I can always hear them talk.

There's always been Ethel,
""Jacob, wake up! You've got to tidy your room now.""
And then Mister Lewis,
""Isn't it time that he was out on his own?""
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds cuckoo to you!
Keep them moving blades sharp

I know what I like, and I like what I know,
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

Sunday night, Mr Farmer called, said,
""Listen son, you're wasting your time, there's a future for you
In the fire escape trade. 
Come up to town!""
But I remembered a voice from the past,
""Gambling only plays when you're winning""
I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure.

All the voices shouting loud
I could only just hear a voice quite near say
""Please help me through the crowd""

Said, if I helped her through she could help me too
But I could see that she was wholly blind
But from her pale face and her pale skin
A moonlight shined

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

When I led her through the people
The angry noise began to grow
She said, ""Let me feel the way the breezes blow
And I'll show you where to go""

So I followed her into a big round cave
She said, ""They're coming for you, now don't be afraid""
Then she sat me down on a cold stone's throne
Carved in jade

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

She leaves me in my darkness
I have to face, face my fear
And the darkness closes in on me
I can hear a whirring sound growing near

I could see the corner of the tunnel
Lit up by whatever's coming here
Two golden globes float into the room
And a blaze of white light fills the air

",The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway [Live],1998
Genesis,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies

Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird

You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around

Dragons coming out of the sea

He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice

Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find the way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes

You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine""

You're no son, you're no son of mine

I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon who seduced you, then finally loosed you

You climbed upon a burning rope to escape the mob below
But you had put the flaming out so that others could now follow
To be out of the bounds and the barks
Of those who do not wish you well

You must blaze a trail of your own, unknown, alone
But keep in mind
Don't live today for tomorrow like you were immortal

And the man in the moon who seduced you, then finally loosed you

That all you have accomplished here will have soon all turned to dust
You dream of a future after life
Well that's as maybe, but I don't know

But you can't take what you left behind, you're all alone
So keep in mind
Don't live today for tomorrow like you were immortal
The only survivors on this world of ours are

The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that frees the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon and now

That in the morning light would not be there
The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man
No place was there known to have been spared
Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone
The day the light went out of the daytime sky

Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom
Nothing out of reach could be observed
Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day
Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit

Now I can feed here before I continue.""

Some were there who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find
The nature of this deadly foe, the dark

By something, though amorphous, yet alive
And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite
The day the light went out of the daytime sky

""Now I can rest here after my journey
Now I can feed here before I continue.""

They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun
By blasting with their missiles through the dark

In the forest in a glade

For who knows what magic
Takes place in his world
So he just thanks her kindly
Preparing to go on his way

Only he will ever know

So he went inside there
To take on what he found

Ooh and the stars were bright

As I held you tight

Early morning Manhattan,
Ocean winds blow on the land.
Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It's the same old ending - time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Drugstore take down the chains.
Metal motion comes in bursts,
The gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road

And out on the subway,

Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.

There's no whitewash victim,
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.

Genesis,"The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
?Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

And new my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth

He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go,
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

Genesis,"The scattered pages of a book by the sea 
Held by the sand, washed by the waves 
A shadow forms cast by a cloud
Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them, effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""

It is chicken, it is eggs,
It is in between your legs.
It is walking on the moon,
Leaving your cocoon.
It is the jigsaw. it is purple haze.
It never stays in one place, but it's not a passing phase,
It is in the singles bar, in the distance of the face
It is in between the cages, it is always in a space
It is here. it is now.
Any rock can be made to roll
If you've enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or goal
Not even in your favorite hole
It is the hope for the dope
Who rides the horse without a hoof
It is shaken not stirred;
Cocktails on the roof.
When you eat right through it you see everything alive
It is inside spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think that its pretentious, you've been taken for a ride.

Genesis,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird

Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause

Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)

He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue

Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Now you caught up in a situation
Just reacting to bullshit, to elevate it
No floors involved, pushing buttons ain't going no where at all
Just continue to fall, continue fall for the okie doke
This reality unscripted not a tv show
Fuck that other shit with long dick, director's choke
Know that really nobody cares
And if it matters to you, then it should never be shared and that's the reason why, I

I walk alone
I walk alone

The other night my nigga told me the game changed
And did I know, I told him, nawl it's the same man, you tripping 
Constantly I'm getting more focused, what's gotten in to me
Arrested my development back then when Tennessee, was slamming
Still a get the party party jumping
Had enough of that trapping, now pull your breaches up
It's time I tell y'all different hip-hop was never missing
To deaf for y'all to listen, y'all really should pay attention
To this elegant medicine I been coughing up every since
Musical angel, know that it's heaven sent
Doubting is cool, you're the one that’s confused
Too much drive to keep going, never stop I refuse
Nothing to lose, too much passion within me
Mechanic with words, I keep the penmanship handy
Mind keep spinning, it's getting harder to pen it
That's why I'll never jot it down, too many will steal it and that's the reason why, I

I walk alone
I walk alone

Listen, if you come to think about the definition of this industry
Lying and deceit, evil malicious and planted seeds
So much to live for, but just the thought of having to feed the family
You remain on the streets, you pray but working for the enemy
Animosity, all over the nation, secrets held under wraps
I call it the silent operation
Minus on probation, felons under eightteen, discrimination
Just take a look at Harris County, yeah
Judging by the color of the skin, 
Rest in peace Trayvon Martin, careful who you’re letting in
The closer the kin want to see you deep below the barrel
Never turn my back, can’t even trust my own shadow
They say the road to heaven gates is real narrow
You know Satan is alive, want to see you burn like the mantle
Got you the Prada and the fame, is it all worth eternal pain
I was heading that way, the Lord redirected my way so, I

 One look - I see no reasons why you can't 
 One chance to be back 
 To the point where everything starts 
 Once chance to keep it together 
 Things fall apart 
 Once I make us believe it's true

 Where do we go? 
 What are the signs? 
 How do we grow?

Freestyle mit acht Mics- Oktopusstyle
Keiner legt sich mit mir an, als wär' ich Optimus Prime
Um meine Stimme zu bezwing' sind deine Boxen zu klein
Selfmade hat uns, der Rest hat Fotzen gesigned
Ich versetze mich in Trance und tanze nackt ums Feuer
Scheiß auf Navigation, denn ich bin schwanzgesteuert
Du kommst im BMW, ich im Kampfhubschrauber
Hoffentlich bleibt beim Gemetzel mein Anzug sauber
Der Bulle hält mich an - ich bleibe cool wie Sub-Zero
Unter meinem Sitz liegt 'n ganzes hasch Kilo
Er peilt nix und wünscht mir gute weitere Fahrt
Noch mal Glück gehabt, das rettet mein' Eigenbedarf
Ich schreib' Line für Line, Song für Song

Aus Langeweile habe ich Gewichte gepumpt
Und der Umfang meiner Brust ist langsam nicht mehr gesund
Und in der Zelle nebenan ist es stumm
Meine Nachbarn brachte ich letzte Nacht um
Den Verstand - Jetzt sind wir auf einer Wellenlänge
Und kommunizieren telepathisch durch Zellenwände
Ich krieg nie Besuch, seitdem die mich wegsperrten
Ich verlier' die Nerven und mach Stress mit 6 Wärtern
Da gibts ne Spritze von so abgefahrenem Zeug
Und die nächsten 3 Tage bin ich vollständig betäubt
Ab und zu kommt so ne Schlampe von Psychiaterin
Und sagt, dass ich, trotz Therapie, immer noch Banane bin
Kein Plan, ob das Gelaber stimmt, Frauen halt
Fakt ist, diese Fotze verlängert meinen Aufenthalt

Ich sitze auf der Bank und fütter die Enten und wink den Passanten
Dann gehts zurück, Block-D, ich werd abgeführt
Ohne die Fesseln hätte ich alle 8 schon massakriert
Ich habe die Bibel die Tora und den Koran gelesen
Mit dem Papst geredet mit Rabbis und zu Allah gebetet
Aber anstatt mich aufzunehmen in den Himmel
Wollte mir jeder von denen einen Auftragsmord vermitteln
Die andern Insassen trauen mir nicht über den Weg
Bis jetzt hat keiner meiner Freunde meine Freundschaft überlebt
Die Selbstmordrate meiner Mithäftlinge steigt
Wenn ich in der Nähe bin auf unerklärliche Weise
Besser du gewöhnst dich an das duschen ohne Seife
Denn wenn nicht wirst du in Zukunft nur noch Blut und Sperma scheißen

Genau wie auf der Autobahn den Laster, als es Nacht war
Dass meine Mom mir nie zeigen konnte, wie sehr
Sie mich tief drin liebt und noch heute fällt es ihr schwer
Dass ich immer das Gefühl hatte, allein zu sein
Dass ich dachte, dass wenn ich sterbe, dann keiner weint
Ich hab' gesagt, dass ihr die Story niemals kriegt
Und doch liegt sie hier vor mir auf dem Tisch

In meiner Welt is' alles möglich
Wasser fließt bergauf und Blumen blühen ewig, ewig
Die Welt bleibt stehen, doch eins ändert sich nie
Die Helden sterben, weil sie es am wenigsten verdienen

Wollt ihr hören, dass ich viele Jahre ein Feigling war?
Dass ich den Schwanz eingezogen, mich nicht verteidigt hab?
Dass mein Cousin, der fast wie ein großer Bruder war
Mit gerade mal zwanzig Jahren qualvoll an seinem Tumor starb?
Dass ich als kleiner Junge von zu Hause fortlief
Ich jahrelang in Kliniken aufwachte und dort schlief?
Dass ich rappe, damit mein Vater nicht obdachlos ist
Dass ich manchmal nich' mehr kann, weil es mich so fickt
Und trotzdem steh' ich jeden Morgen auf und trag' mein Kreuz
An manchen Tagen mit 'nem Lachen und an manchen heul'nd
Aber das macht nix, weil der Scheiß macht unverwundbar
Ich brauch' gar nix, außer einem gottverdammten Wunder träum' von 
Goldenen Ketten und null Problem', aber leider sieht das anders aus
Ich träum' von goldenen Ketten und 'nem ruhigem Leben
Aber leider komm' ich nich' hier raus, yoa

Aber auch wenn es das nicht ist, gefällt's mir gut hier
Weißt du noch, wie sie gesagt haben, wir komm' nie hoch?
Aber Gramm wurden zu Grammys und ihr macht weiter Kilos
Als wir underground war'n, hat uns keiner gepusht
Die andern Jungs aus der Hood sind ständig rein in die Clubs
Und zu viel Weißes geschnupft oder paar Teile geschluckt
Mann, die Nächte durchzuschreiben, das war Teil meiner Sucht
Und Sikk da Kid hat bis zum Morgengrauen gebounced
Und ging die Sonne auf, dann gab's freshen, neuen Sound
Geschlafen haben wir kaum, also war das auch kein Traum
Eines Morgens wacht' ich auf und war ein Clown
Eyau, ich brauch das, ich wurd für diese Scheiße gebor'n
Ich überschreite die Norm auch noch in zweitklassiger Form

Und euch Behinderten geht's immer um's Geschäft
Check das, ich war wie stigmatisiert, dann kam Sikk, hat's kapiert

Uh, damals im Kreißsaal, als meine Mom mich schreien sah
Da war ihr gleich klar, das mit dem Jung' wird nicht so einfach
Ich war so verdammt cool, mein Brutkasten war ein Eisfach
Und fing sofort an zu rappen, worauf hin man mir ein Mic gab
Yeah, wir sind die Crew des Milleniums
Die Supa Dope Brothers Live, wir sind die coolsten im Ghetto
In der Villa, in der Schule, auf der Straße, aus den Boxen
In den tiefgelegten Karren, in den Klubs und in den Charts
Und ja, wir sind jetzt fast sowas wie Stars
Und nein, glaub ma', wir war'n vorher schon high
Fangfrage, was haben mein IQ und meine PIN gemeinsam?
Wie, kapierst du nicht, beide sind vierstellig
Selfmade, Baby, wir brechen den Rekord
Ruf mich vor der Arbeit an, ich battle dich in Shorts
Sikk ist mein Brother from another mother, wir holen den Highscore
Meinst du das alles ernst, nein, nicht mal ein Wort
Oder doch, das verrat' ich never, bin ich jetzt Backpack- oder Straßenrapper?
Ist auch egal, macht mal Platz für Sikk an den Turntables

Dran zu denken, wie es dir da oben geht und wie du lachst
Wie du spielst, wie du fliegst und wie du über mich wachst
Dabei sollte ich der sein, der dich beschützt
Alles ist verkehrt und falsch, ich werd' verrückt
Und deshalb werd' ich zu dir kommen und dich in die Arme nehmen

Heb ab und werde Eins mit der Unendlichkeit

Ihr Klang hallt nur noch dumpf durch die Erinnerung
Die letzten Worte, ein letzter Versuch
Zu gestehen mein Besuch war nicht umsonst, doch ich bin wie gelähmt, eine

Was aus einer Katze kriecht, wird immer Mäuse fressen
Bringt eure Besten, degradiere sie am Fließband
Ganz ohne Machine Gun, mach' einfach nur den Beat an

Bühne ohne Szene, Schatten ohne Sonne
Schlüssel ohne Schloss und Trommler ohne Trommel
Züge ohne Schiene, Motten ohne Licht
Clowns ohne Schminke, ein Leben ohne dich
Adern ohne Blut, Sternschnuppen ohne Wünsche

Ich fiel vom Himmel meiner Mama in den Arm, schon
Meine Zeugung war ein kosmischer Plan
Das Ergebnis einer Kreuzung aus Venus und Mars, man
Schickte mich zur Erde, doch ich kam nie dort an, mein
Körper war zwar dort, aber ich war wie gefang', die
Ander'n Kids hab'm gespürt, was ich bin
Und mich verstoßen, einfach weil mit mir was nich' stimmt
Ich wuchs auf wie ihres gleichen
Lernte ihre Sprachen, die Gesten, ihre Zeichen
Doch je mehr ich sie verstand, desto mehr war'n sie mir fremd
War nie wirklich zu Haus bei der Spezies namens ""Mensch""
Ich war klein - und so sah ich in die Sterne
Und weinte so bitter, viele Trän', dass die Meere versalzten
Doch ich war zu weit weg, mich hat niemand gehört
Und so bleib ich hier, bis sie den Planeten zerstör'n

Ich gehör' hier nich' her, ich bin was and'res
Ich komme vom and'ren Ende der Galaxis
Wir teil'n rein gar nichts, außer den Planeten
Ihr und ich, ich und ihr sind nicht die selbe Spezies

Ich wurde älter, wandte mich von ihn' ab
Lasst mich allein, ich will weder eure Liebe, noch den Hass
Zog umher wie ein Streuner, verloren und einsam
Immer noch besser als verlogen gemeinsam
Doch eines Tages schickte man mir ein Signal
Eine Botschaft von Zuhause, tief aus dem All, nach
Langer Suche hätten sie mich jetzt entdeckt
Ich sei auserwählt dafür und so schenkten sie mir Raaap!
Und die Mission lautet schlicht: ""Werd' der Beste,
Dann hol'n wir dich zurück. Keine weiteren Tests mehr.
Wenn's gelingt, is' es wahr und du bist einer von uns.
Der Beweis. Wir brauchen keinen weiteren Grund""
Und jetzt verstehst du, warum ich so bin wie ich bin
Ihr wollt Fame, ihr wollt Kohle, ich will einfach nur der King sein

Auf eurem Weg in diese Schlacht wird jeder Schritt ein kleiner Tod sein
Der Mondschein wird euch kein großer Trost sein, oh nein
Denn ihr seid sterblich und ich werd nich' eher fertig sein
Bis ihr unter Schmerzenschreien von Herzen weint, ernst gemeint
Wer will der erste sein? Freiwillige ein' Schritt nach vorn
Dich trifft der Zorn, du wirst dir gleich wünschen, du wärst nicht geboren

Und ich geh durch viele Hände, Kontinente
Meer und Wüste bis zum Händler aus Europa und ich glänze, funkel, strahle
Frisch geschliffen und poliert
Ein wahrhaftiger Edelstein von makelloser Zier und Perfektion
Lupenrein, weiß mit Preisschild um den Hals
Im Schaufenster dieses Juweliers
Sie sieht mich, will mich er kauft mich, steck mich an ihren Finger
Und ich schimmer wunderschön wie immer
Sie trägt mich spazieren präsentiert mich und verliert mich
Ausgerechnet auf dem Nachttisch ihres Hotelzimmers
Wo sie ihr Versprechen brach und laut stöhnte, ihren Ehemann vergessen hat
Und das nicht zum letzten mal
So lieg' ich da als stummer Zeuge
Meine Anwesenheit ist Beweis dessen, was nicht sein sollte
Eins folgt dem andern
Und als das Zimmermädchen mich findet
Verschwinde ich in ihrer Handtasche und sie bringt mich zum Pfandleiher
Doch der droht ihr mit Anzeige
Weil er ihr ankreidet, was anscheinend offensichtlich ist
Sie ist nicht die rechtmäßige Besitzerin
Und so steckt mich der Geschäftsmann in den Safe
Und fängt schon mal an zu rechnen wie viel Geld er gemacht hat
Denn er zählt es gern achtsam, weil er schläft dann entspannter
Doch plötzlich geht die Tür auf Hände hoch, Überfall! 
Pack alles was du hast in den Rucksack all deinen scheiß Schmuck, man!
Und die Jungs springen in den Fluchtwagen
Wissen noch nicht dass sie zum Letzten mal in Freiheit Luft atmen
Weil sie die Bullen jagen und kriegen
Handschellen klicken, schnell ins Kittchen
Und weil keiner mit der Beute entwischt ist
Lieg' ich in der Asservatenkammer, ein paar Tage lang
Bis einer von der Staatsanwaltschaft mich einsteckt
Und auf Kreuzfahrt bringt
So ein teurer Ring, sie muss doch ja sagen
Denkt er sich und kniet vor ihr
Aber nein und so steht er allein, noch eine Weile am Bug
Schaut auf den Ozean und schmeißt mich rein
Sinke immer tiefer, immer kälter
Immer mehr Druck, kein Licht mehr, keine Menschen
Hier war mein Platz von Anfang an, verborgen im Dunkel
Wär' besser ihr hättet mich nie gefunden!
Hier war mein Platz von Anfang an, verborgen im Dunkel
Wär' besser ihr hättet mich nie gefunden!

Denn ich will, dass sich Kohle häuft
Bevor ich sie verbrenn', als ob ich Strom erzeug'
Ey, du kannst mich in der Falle finden

Ihre Worte standen über dem Gesetz
Aus Respekt wurd' keiner frech, sie hatte einfach immer recht
Ging es um Cash, dann war Nonna wie die Steuer
Jeder hat ihr abgedrückt, Bündel unterm Küchentisch
Klar, dass jeder sie gegrüßt hat, Bürgermeister oder Priester
Und bei Streit, dann war meine Nonna sowas wie ein Richter
Ging sie zum Laden, trugen andre ihre Taschen
Es gab nichts und niemand, den die Frau jemals zu fürchten hatte
Außer Gott, denn sie ging jeden Tag zur Messe
Da verstand sie keinen Spaß, Rosenkränze jeden Tag

Wer genau soll jetzt für mich entscheiden, was ist richtig und was falsch?
Hat gesagt, „Nimm keine Drogen!“, das war nicht so ernst gemeint
Red' ich mir ein, paffe dabei und werde high, ja
Denn sie hat auch gesagt, ich soll meinen Träumen folgen
Und zum Träumen braucht man Wolken, also noch einen rollen
Nonna meinte: „Lass die Finger von den Bitches
Leck keine fremden Muschis und benimm dich!“
Und Nonna hat gesagt, Lil Kappa sei ein Gentleman
Ich glaub', sie meint vor'm Ficken auch mal Pizza essen gehen
„Sprich keine Gossensprache!“
Wie soll ich 'nem Hurensohn dann sagen, dass er ein Hurensohn ist? Heh?
Und ich soll sparsam leben

This is as close you gon' get to the streets without gettin shot




[Chorus]
In the streets

Cock guns and bust yo' heat

In the streets

Where we live and die for beef

In the streets

Hos'll set you up, get blood on your sheets

In the streets

By any means we gon' eat

In the streets

Sellin drugs you might blow up

In the streets

They got hos to set you up

In the streets
Even police is corrupt


In the streets

There's a million niggaz just like us


[Sticky Fingaz]


I swear I ain't been the same since they had to bury my pops


I'm uncivilized like I was raised in a box
I'm told get your sister raped nigga makin you watch

Fuck the cops, fuck the world, I'm above the law
They can't catch me, what you think the gloves is for?


Got your ear to the street, you ain't hearin me

Motherfucker, the streets got they ear to me

Speak my name, better think careful duke

Like when clingin on to life who gon' be there for you?

Get blood on they seats, drive you to the hospital


I got an image to protect and records to sell
Nobody!!! Cause you goin to hell

Besides a one sided story is easy to tell

My poster on the wall only way you see me in jail

Sticky Fingaz nigga, the legend, the myth

Niggaz get shot everytime I shoot the gift



[Chorus]


[X-1]


I banged out in dorms and tore mouths off


While y'all run to cops as soon as it pops off
I can't respect lames when I'm knowin you soft

That's why I feel the pain for my thugs up north

No regrets in this world, not one care

No respect for this world without no peers

They did me wrong for years, I'm finally gettin back

Never sheaded a tear seein niggaz on they back

Lord knows it hurts to put his people in the dirt

Bullet holes in shirts and chumps buried in skirts

Prayin to God is hard, these streets don't play


But you gotta keep up your guard and hope the pain go away

I'm from where they shoot street lights out
And you gotta yell to talk over passin trains

And watch who you fuck with when passin 'cain

Cause them same fists'll get your wrists trapped in chains, nigga



[Chorus]



[Geneveese]

My killers move triggers and set firearms off

Smoke the type of blunts that set fire alarms off

One shot'll blow your face, chest and your arms off

Murderin Guiliani for all the pain that he's causin

Launderin dirty laundry through banks of corporate ?

Shit doctors can only calm me til the drugs wear off

One pump of the sawed-off and your squad'll be hauled off

Dropped her off in the car lock, locked in the trunk of the car

Shit's official, we spittin through government issue

40 automatic pistols rippin through brain tissue

Stuffin coke up wit your bitch I'll piss through

And a black on black lambo, puffin on A Line Of Crystal!
Under our politics, codes of the street


Never negotiate with killers with intentions of breach

Only associate with villains if you willin to bleed
Cause leakin'll get your mother hogtied and brutally beat

Sur une planète épuisée
Main dans la main les yeux fixés vers demain
Sans trop savoir où aller

Où sont passés les glaciers, les forêts et les fées?

J'ai sauvé tout c'que j'ai pu
Tout a brûlé, personne a vu le train passer?
Dire qu'on voulait tout changer

J'ai des souvenirs teintés des bleus du passé
Pour pouvoir vous regarder
Toi et ton frère et vos chemins à tracer
Pour pouvoir vous raconter

Des histoires de glaciers
De forêts vierges à rêver
Les tempêtes de janvier
Les nuits fraîches en été

Pour la terre il n'y a que des mots
Une guerre à coup d'épée dans l'eau
C'est moins cher des hivers sans manteaux

Enfants des glaces fondantes du nouveau nord
Pour que l'espoir neige encore

Que vos yeux soient nos demains

Bien au-delà des faux sourires
Et des destins auxquels j’aspire

À me dire que l’vent peut tourner 
Même si l’vieux temps s’est envolé

Et puis bientôt font leur entrée
Les méchants loups que j’ai flattés
Dans les moments de coeurs fanés
J’ai fait l’amour tou’déguisée

Quand les appels que j’ai lancés
Se sont perdus dans la routine
C’est pour te sonner les matines 
Que loin de toi j’allais danser

J’ai eu besoin pour avancer
De me punir, de tout détruire
C’est la seule façon que j’ai trouvée
Pour éviter d’avoir à fuir

Encore assise, presque couchée
À me demander à quoi penser
À me dire que l’vent peut tourner 
Même si l’vieux temps s’est envolé

Sur les chemins que j’ai tracés
D’hier vers jusqu’à maintenant
Il y a les doutes que j’ai semés
Où l’espoir pousse en attendant

Il y a la paix que j’ai cherchée
Sans vraiment vouloir la trouver
Et puis l’amour que j’ai trouvé 
Sans jamais vraiment le chercher

J’ai fait confiance à chaque instant 
En vivant toujours au printemps
Quand la neige venait à tomber
C’était ma journée de congé

J’ai mis au monde cent mille enfants
Et deux d’entre-eux sont déjà grands
Tout ça pour appeler la beauté 
Et pour ne jamais l’oublier

Encore assise, presque couchée
À me demander à quoi penser
À me dire que l’vent peut tourner 
Même si l’vieux temps s’est envolé

Encore assise, presque levée
À me demander pourquoi penser
À me dire que l’vent a tourné 
Et que l’bon temps peut arriver",Encore assise,
Geneviève Jodoin,"Tu m'appelles Ça va pas
J'te dis: Viens, reste pas là-bas
Tu sais ici rien n'a vraiment changé
Les mêmes traineries dans l'entrée
Les mêmes taches sur le plancher
Tes vieux chums à toi pour te réchauffer

Les odeurs de ces années
Où l'on s'est inventés
Parlent encore de toi
De ta vie
bien avant la nuit
qui tombe sur tes yeux
Devenus vieux
Sur ton corps qui s'endort 
Rêves-tu encore?

Pendant que j't'écris cette chanson
tu t'apprêtes à prendre le large
Celui qui t'avale, celui qui t'fait mal.

Pourtant, on vit l'même présent
Que fuis-tu loin de ton nord?
Sur la neige amère qui t'aspire encore
Reviens, j'te parlerai de rien
J'veux juste que tu sois bien
Que tu croies encore plus fort en demain

J'auras pas à me dire pourquoi
De te savoir au chaud, loin du vide
Ça me suffira
C'est pour ça que je suis là.",Gris,
Geneviève Jodoin,"Ce soir pour tout vous dire
J'ai rien à dire
J'ai comme un début de rhume
Et les idées tournées vers l'oreiller
Rien de spécial est arrivé
Une journée vite oubliée
Pour sa tiédeur et sa tranquillité

Là, je suis là
Seulement pour éviter d'aller m'coucher
J'ai peur des rêves trop ordinaires
Des rêves qui m'empêchent de dormir
Là, je suis là à me faire croire que j'ai envie de sortir
À me faire croire que j'suis trop occupée
Pour entretenir mes amitiés

J'me sens lâche, j'ai envie de rien
J'vous l'dis j'aimerais mieux être mon chien
Me faire flatter, n'penser à rien

Je tourne en rond et j'm'étourdis
Paraît qu'le temps qui passe nous assagit
J'voudrais tellement qu'ma vie me fasse envie
Là, je suis là
J'ai simplement nulle part où aller
V'nez donc m'chercher,
V'nez donc m'chercher,
Là, je suis là
Seulement pour pouvoir vous écrire 
Que je suis là, je suis là
Je suis là, tellement là

Là, moi seule et moi
Mon coeur qui bat
Comment c'était déjà 
là-bas
Toi seul et toi 
Ton coeur qui bat
Respire encore
un peu pour moi.",Là,
Geneviève Jodoin,"J'aurais tellement d'choses à conter
Je sais plus par où commencer
J'ai trop d'idées qui tournent en rond
C'est quoi donc déjà la passion

C'est la douceur c'est la tendresse
C'est la chaleur et puis mes fesses
Dans les temps d'ombre et de silence
C'est la violence ou la patience

Quand la vie met son manteau gris
Et que l'espoir se cherche un nom 
Y'a moi qui crie tout près d'ici
Envoye réveille, ça tourne pas rond

Moi j'ai tellement de vide aux yeux
De mains séchées dans les cheveux
Tellement de mots d'amour qui pleurent 
Sur des vieux papiers pleins d'odeurs

Oublie mes promesses qui tremblent
Faisons toujours comme bon nous semble
Encore un peu encore cette fois
Et pour toujours, qui sait?  Parfois...

Tu sais que j'ai besoin de vous
Tout près de moi pour être nous
Et dans les jours qui se ressemblent
Nous serons la prouesse d'être ensemble

Quand la vie met son manteau gris
Et que l'espoir se cherche un nom
Y'a moi qui crie tout près d'ici
Envoye réveille, ça tourne en rond

J'ai pris des trains vers nos lointains
Toi tes journées se sont fanées
Quand tu me cherches pour me trouver
Moi je t'attends pour te cacher

Et je touche, qui a gagné?
Et nos deux corps tout effleurés
Je veux nos deux chemins croisés
La planète mars pour se coller

J'avais tellement de choses à dire
Mais la fatigue me fait mentir
Et puis ce soir se fait sentir
Et puis bonne nuit comme un sourire

Quand la nuit comme un manteau gris
Éloigne le noir de mes espoirs
Y'a moi qui sait que tout est dit
Et qui s'endort sur son histoire.",Ni oui ni non,
Geneviève Jodoin,"Doucement
Prends ton temps
Comme avant
Au présent
Vois plus loin
que le bout de nous
Redeviens
celui qui s'en fout
Laisse tomber
tes idées de moi
L'amour meurt
ferme tes yeux et Vois

Tout de moi veut changer
Vider ses rêves usés
Réapprendre à crier
Et à se brûler

C'est pas contre toi
Si je suis devenue moi

Loin devant
Deux printemps
Soufflent fou
Soufflent nous

Pour y croire
je veux te savoir
Vieux et jeune
dans le même miroire
Sans ta peur
du blanc et du noir
Juste un peu
plus près de notre histoire

C,est pas contre toi si parfois
Je redeviens moi
Loin de nous
C'est pas contre toi
si cette fois
J'ai besoin de moi
plus que de nous
En fait plus que de tout

Genevieve Lacey,"I woke up with the dread, a stranger by my bed
The room was cold, I swear she'd entered with no tread
'Are you real?' I said, 'Or just somebody in my head?'
She said, 'Hush now, you must follow.'
Next thing I recall I'm walking by a silver lake
I couldn't tell if I was dreaming or awake
She kept just ahead of me no matter how I tried to gain on her
I knew I was bound to follow
I had to follow

You, you must go
With me down below
Down below

All night long I trailed, following her shape
My one and only wish to look upon her face
Though I seemed to be the hunter
I was much more like the prey
And I was bound to follow
I had to follow

You, you must go
With me down below
Down below

She comes to visit me now more and more these days
One night she'll wait for dawn by the silver lake
She'll lift her veil and show her face and take me in her cold embrace
And to the bottom, I will follow
I will follow

You, you will go
With me down below
Down below",Bound to Follow,2013

I need to know what I've become

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Están al tope, por que lo que consumen no lo rechazan

Porque viven del menudo, es que mi pauta esta en Neptuno
Te caes si tu me miras, o molestar en la calma china
O tener mira bajaron las F negras en campanilla
Compramos los mil kit de 100 que son pa' las glopetas
Si aprietan van a correr tu y tu mujer en chancletas

Frabian, aquí se descarta a to' el que copera

Y a los titeres de embuste dile que hagan los ajustes

Esto no es relajo, lambebicho, demuestre su hombría
A sangre fria si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de dia
Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores
No riego veneno, pero papi sin cojones pai a mi me tienen
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene
Con musica hija e' puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabron

Ya estoy manso muchachos o quieres ver como me agacho?
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho
Ustedes son queso con nachos partirme, tu estas borracho?
Acho en cualquier sentido te desparracho
Las pacas y los billetes las he visto encurrucha'
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos
Se te adelanto lo siento lechon llego Navidad
Jingle bells, el panzon como Santa Claus
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta' en el calzon
Bebo date un resbalon, que me has dado la impresión
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón brra

Ya Los Menores salen pa la calle
Los mas que suenan en la calle bebo se han quedao
Las cosas ya no son iguales
Y del caserio no salen

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco
Mientras yo ando por ahí, willeando en la moto sin casco
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras
Lo que vale el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track

People say it's not the thing to do 
But that's the safest way to making it feel good 
Hey I 

When you're alone what you do is what you do 
I'm not scared to say 
When you're alone don't you ever get confused 
Ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good baby

I won't be afraid to touch myself 
It's all right 
I said it's all right 
I don't think it's wrong to touch yourself 
Ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good

I won't be afraid to touch myself

The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
Are-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to snuggle you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little rock'll turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge

[Masta Killa]
Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is MC'ing at it's best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul to war us, be the growlest
Asiatic arctic flow is so frigid

[RZA]
Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Wu, so coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distressed like the damsal, lost like little Hansel
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Gold-plated desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the neighbor yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being took and operated
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, ark, who goes there?
Power-you smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Ain't nothing but bones, we plotted the sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
See-Cypher Pigs, can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a click that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic

before i was born that's all i know  
there were two young cruel brave young men    
their king said hit the road and come back again  
they got the gig 'cause the king thought they had what it took 
and the aztecs shivered and incas shook  
they saw the white sails and muskets long  
thought these are gods/but they were wrong    
to the native people's sorrow  
here come Cortez and Pizarro  
Hernando and Francisco  
hacked their way to heaven blow by blow  
men of god in Spain they worked for someone else  
in Mexico    
they burned their ships upon the shore  
said we ain't goin' back to Spain no more  
in the smoking embers on the sand lay the future of the land    
to the native people's sorrow  
here come Cortez and Pizarro

hacked their way to heaven blow by blow  
men of god in Spain they worked for someone else 
in Mexico    
now gifts were gave/hands were shook  
but men are men/and man they took    
now the thing that brought this on for me  
was my cool earring and my new goatee  
the mirror shows a 16th century caballero  
so i thought i'd get some armor and grab my steed  
ride down across the border and over the seas and

I knew this chick by the name of Vevorine
Who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
We did in the rain, on the hood of a Range
But Vevorine, had a special friend called Heroin
She told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine
In the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
Cause it's a poor man's girl, and I will never give love
To how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
Martin had a dream, nigga, I did too
To make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup
So, I took it that thaw, and hit the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
Momma said, never get high on your own supply
Especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
Reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes in, the more I disappear
Fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
New Year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
Watch this strip, make me back it up, D'Angelo knows the feeling
Off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling
This tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
Watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
I'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past

That's just how women is, I reminisce
On when I had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch
And I ain't the best, but I ain't never denied
Tell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine
The plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
You get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
I'm on the grind, I don't settle for mines, nigga
With this track, a broad, with a pack, before I peddle a dime

But it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage

Gente de Zona,"Hoy me he dado cuenta que he perdido el tiempo
Pensando en conseguir más de lo que ya tengo
Sin valorar lo que la vida ya me daba a tu lado
Y ahora que te tengo tan lejos reconozco los días

He llorado, como un niño
Que no ve la luz del sol cuando es verano
Y le han quitado, de sus manos
Su mejor sonrisa el tiempo más preciado

Y no me he cansado de soñarte a mi lado
De pensar que al día de hoy me has olvidado
Yo te amo, yo te amo, yo te amo

Y aunque dí la vuelta al mundo no conozco una frontera
Que los corazones rompan dos, no hay patria ni bandera
Más bonita que la brisa que se dibuja en tu cara
Soy pirata navegando en los mares de tu mirada

No quiero dejar de pensar en ti
No puedo dejar de soñar contigo
Dime qué hago si no estás aquí
Te necesito como el aire que respiro

He llorado, como un niño
Que no ve la luz del sol cuando es verano
Y le han quitado, de sus manos
Su mejor sonrisa el tiempo más preciado

Y no me he cansado de soñarte a mi lado
De pensar que al día de hoy me has olvidado

Cuando me besa, me fortalece, me mira pa' que yo empiece

Unknown, unread, it wasn't easy,
And each day, each night,
Wasn't wrong, nor right,
I can't remember what I said
I lost my head.

2. What will I feel maybe tomorrow,
But time not real, hours I can borrow,
So until for now, as long as how,
I can't remember what I said
I lost my head.

(Part 2)

1. I lost my head, forget what I said,
What's the use to try to deny it,
I didn't think it would ever happen again,
Wondering why, once bitten, twice shy,
Never thought again would I try it,
And even though maybe soon
It would end, wanting to stop,
But had to go on,
Give a little part of my person,
And don't reflect,
Don't remember what I said,
I was afraid and I stayed away
Making sure of my independence,
Isn't it true
That I lost my head.

Took my time and I didn't rush into anything,
Showed my face, just forgetting myself,
I lost my head.

2. Everything's true, but everything lies,
It's so hard to try to explain it,
It doesn't matter it happened anyway,
And for the time while someone is mine,
I'll go on won't try to contain it,
Though never sure it could finish anyday,
I lost my head,
So glad that I made
Right or wrong, I made the decision
To take my chances,
Give out something of me,
How will I feel tomorrow?
Not real trying to avoid a collision,
I lost my head,
But today I can see.

Took my time and I didn't rush into anything,
Showed my face, just forgetting myself,
I lost my head.

Gentle Giant,"Strange though we made it, in those days that were bare
What pulled us through them, something was there.
I can remember, drifting apart,
Thoughtless ways much stronger,
As the time grew longer
One for one not always,
Then you said to me...

It's only goodbye, a smile and a cry, and suddenly over, when
I think of you know, in kindness allow. My memory lingers, then
It's only goodbye, my strength telling lies, Just facing what had to be.

Mixed my reflections, did we think it was real
Was it forever, fear not, just feel.
You had your troubles, yes I had mine.
Weren't we both for sharing, No not really caring,
I would realize that, when you said to me...

A message on everything there.

Didn't believe it, although I saw myself.
Wanted to look there again,

Written where it doesn't show.
What do we see, the product or the message.
So hard to tell I don't know.

A passage run, go down, descend.
And underground the air is stale
With blurring light and endless rail.
On the wheels in motion, underground.

Silent noise, relentless sound.
Through shuttered aisle, the wheels go 'round.
The day is night, yet never still,
From port to port, with miles to kill.
On wheels in motion, underground.
Just the locomotion, underground.

Windows dark, no view obscured.
With moving eyes, no sight assured.
Yet moving on, from place to place,
Through corridors, without a face.

His dreams are there -
Searching for answers he will look everywhere.
Thinks he has won -
A place in the sun
Free from the worries and the ways of everyone.

The coats of time
And find mad eyes and see those sharpened teeth.

What you are
It shows the face, the evil face of sin.

Schooldays the happy time when we were feeling no care
Schooldays when three said that we'd better be friends forever
How long is ever isn't it strange
Schooldays together why do they change

Did kites fly
And I spy
And you cry
To run fast
Or come last
You know how
We made vows
They're gone now
We made friends
We broke friends
No more friends

Remember
Remember when we
Together
Went to the sea
Was it real or did we dream. The days of children gone
Seagull's scream and pink ice cream and the deep blue sky
And the waves seem high and golden sand and the town

Wait for us always
Wait for me

His love is so pure and devine 

Just keep that smile up on your face make it an easy day 
Never let dem get you down cause you will make it anyway 
With Jah love ina your heart I'm sure you will never go astray 
And while the sunshine you got to make hay

Me nuh go stop work and try until me reap the fruit 
And as long as there is no justice man hafi go revolute 
Just tell the children the truth

If you did prepare fore those rainy days
You wouldn't be sweeped away by the storm
If you would listen what the wise man say
All that you had wouldn't be gone
If you would trust into the father
And find a few minutes to pray
Now life seems so much harder
I know jah would show you the way

Rise up and your heart it must be clean
But if you mingle ina corruption jah jah nuh let you in
I trust ina the highest supreme
Jah make i a pure as a stream
Never will i trade my love for vanity
Never will i be a victim of dem insanity
All i have is love for humanity
Come help me sing da song ya if you agree with mee

Don't burn your bridges
Don't you ever turn back and close the door
Cause it just might be
That you want to use that same bridge once more

Continue do your best and life goes on and on

Ich bin für Liebe, ich bin für die die’s lieben zu leben
Ich bin für die, die Liebe geben auch wenn’s schwer ist im Leben
Ich bin für die die’s erst erleben, dann denken, dann weitergeben
Statt los zu reden und bloß zu erzählen um sich groß zu geben
Ich bin für die, die sich Blöße geben, damit wir sehen
Und verstehen dass die echten Weisen in Schwäche zeigen die Größe sehen
Ich bin für die, die uns konfrontieren mit uns selbst
Bin für den der Versprechen hält, bin für den, der beißt wenn er bellt
Ich bin für Menschen die sich angekettet auf Gleise setzen
Rebellieren statt zu sehen was passiert und’s leise zu fressen
Ich bin für Nachbarn die helfen, Picknick im Park
Für Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen, Klar bin ich für Peace im Irak
Ich bin für CD’s für weniger Geld im Media Markt
Damit jeder sich’s leisten kann was ich sag und nicht bloß dein Arzt
Ich bin für mehr Jobs, mehr Plätze, mehr Stellen, mehr Arbeitsmarkt
Ich bin für alles was Hoffnung macht und Kräfte schafft jeden Tag


Ich bin dagegen, gegen alles zu sein, doch ich bin gegen so manches was mir bekannt ist
denn manches muss ja nicht sein
Bin gegen genmanipuliertes Gemüse und gegen Schwein
Ich bin dagegen dass man meint man muss kompliziert sein um klug zu scheinen
Ich bin dagegen Depp zu sein, ich bin dagegen nett zu sein
Zu manchen Menschen die meinen sie müssten respektlos sein
Bin gegen Bosse die meinen um der Chef zu sein
Muss man ekelig sein und die Mitarbeiter treten und schreien
Bin gegen Politik die konstruiert ist uns zu kontrollieren
Kommunizier indem ich kontroverse Verse komponiere
Komm mit mir und sieh die Welt so wie sie ist
Denn ich bin gegen jeden einzelnen Faschist der uns verseucht mit seinem Gift
Ich bin gegen Tierversuche, ich bin gegen das Klonen von Menschenleben
Bin dagegen das zur Zeit noch Millionen in Wellblechhütten wohnen
Und, mann, ich bin dagegen aufzugeben
Bin dagegen zuzusehen wenn Menschenleben untergehen

Mir ist egal wie viel du raffst in 'nem Jahr
Solang bis du hast was du brauchst und machst was du glaubst ist alles klar
Mir ist egal wie viel du weißt und welcher Meister dein Lehrer war
Welcher Kaiser dein Herrscher ist, wen du weißt wer du selber bist
Mir ist egal, wie viel Erfahrung du hast wenn du nur stehst und nichts bewegst
Und ganz und gar nichts aus Erfahrung machst, mir ist egal wie viel du feierst und trinkst, wenn am nächsten Tag für die Kinder gesorgt ist, ist das kein Ding
Und mir ist egal wie viel Kritik ich bekomm
Für manchen Tracks denn andere sagen mir sie lieben die Songs
Mir ist egal wie abgehoben du bist, flieg nur davon
Denn wenn du zu nah zur Sonne kommst, dann wirst du schon alleine wiederkommen
Denn sonst zerschmelzen dir die Flügel im Nu
Mir ist egal wie viel du lügst ich hör dir einfach nur zu
Denn irgendwann verfängst du dich in deinem eigenen Strick
Dann ist egal wie sehr du schreist du brichst dein eigenes Genick",Widerstand,2006

Ambassador status bring the loot back to the masses
Who live like hostages, the system be abusive like the music business is
We exist in the abyss but images be marvellous like novelists
Picture this like hieroglyphics on the fines papyrus
The world is ours but is devoured by the hour
Spread the scripture like Egyptians while the wicked spread the virus
Through the lies I realize the righteous bare my likeness
But they spite us so let the weak recite this
Sow my seed amongst the captives let the fleet complete the cipher

I'm passionate about this memory I got this feeling
Question to the leaders and me ask them what them dealin'
See seh that the world need a spiritual healin'
What about the youth that we leavin'?
Cyberspace take their mind only that them a believe in
The elders get bitter so them stop from teachin'!
Miles from the youth than how you ago reach him
Tell me how you ago reach him

We remembering the past but if there wasn't the past
Just remembering seh there wouldn't be no future
So I say it with all costs
On your behalf just like how Christ died for the youths ya
That's just a moment in time
To mesmerize your mind you better acknowledge the truth ya
If your objective is crime you keep bein' unkind
Then your own weapon will shoot ya

And we never used to send text messages

The future is so great, can't forget the past (no)

Certain good things happen in the past
Now everything change everybody move fast
And the youths me see dem act like dem lost
Everybody wanna be a rebel without a cause
(You remember) when we coulda hands out
And a roll down south everybody coulda roll all about
Now the tension so high like it want touch the sky
Dem a plan now fi try get you out
Mannerism is depleted the past is deleted
Dem fi know life s more than a flaas
And the children used to listen to the teacher
Now the children dem a gwaan like dem a the teacher of the class
Dem used to say thank you and good morning
Now not even question a ask
But you can t blame the youth 'cause they don t know the truth
There is no one to help dem stick to the task

Now life seems so much harder
I know jah would show you the way

Rise up and your heart it must be clean
But if you mingle ina corruption jah jah nuh let you in

Never will i be a victim of dem insanity
All i have is love for humanity

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.

On the railroad tracks and broken backs that built it
The highways ran past paper mills and liquor bottles lined the windowsills
Where we all looked out at the dreams that we were chasing

Got high on the Mississippi
We made love on the Mississippi

He worked long, he worked hard
Swallowing pride so that I could survive

With an old piano to keep for company

Hey beautiful, that's what I used to say
We met out in the street under a street lamp
And you asked me if you could buy me a drink

With photographs, lipstick and favorite songs
It was too late to look you in the eyes
And tell you I wasn't full of lies

I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase, I'll see you around

Hey beautiful, are you happy now?
Did you find your prince and does he treat you like a lady?
I admit that I'm a bad boy to bring home
But it takes two to bring a house to the ground

I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase
I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase, I'll see you around

We were on and off, inside and out
Lost my voice when I screamed and shout
Back and forth, drunk and dry
Slamming doors and teary-eyed

Hey beautiful, do you remember your name?
Hey beautiful, do you still look the same? 
Do you think that love is a stupid game to play?
And when love is lost can you win anyway?

I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face

Before I get much thinner
I'll take a job driving stage for Uncle Sam
And regardless of the weather
I'll put on my patent leather
So people won't know how poor I am

We're up and away
Before the light of day
From rapids to reservations
We'll get to our destination

Forty miles down the track
To the town of Hackensack
Where the lady's forty, fat and fair
And she's got pretty daughters three
And they're as hungry as they can be
So my hands are always cold when I get there

We're up and away
Before the light of day
From rapids to reservations
We'll get to our destination

Beads and lace for ladies
Blankets for the babies
Flour from roller mills
Fiddle strings, butter and pills

And in the dusk light we can see
The town of old Bemidji 
And the town's folk gathering out in the snow
They want tobacco, soap and tea
And jugs of jubilee
But there's no time here to drink we have to go

You’re like a big fish trapped inside a bowl
You don’t see that you will fall
Unless you get out of this dead end northern town

Gotta get out on the road
and let the wind fly through your hair
Get out on the road and
turn up the radio

See them born, see them die
Without stepping foot across the county line
You’re not like them, you got a dream
Start the car and leave it all behind

Gotta get out on the road
and let the wind fly through your hair
Get out on the road and
turn up the radio

Scared of the dark but you don’t why
Angry for nothing and hiding to hide
The world is too big to be trapped in your room
Open the doors and then howl at the moon
Now, now Alice
Oh Alice
Oh Alice
Woah, Alice

Snow will melt and rains will come
Mud will dry and flies will buzz around
They’ll be whiskey shots down at the bar
But the same faces every night won’t go too far

I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!
When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?
Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!
Oh, what is it?
We got a bone to pick with you
There's no food, no water
Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
stinkin' entrees!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is. 
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms
No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound
That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is
hunker down and scoot
Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
buzzards for your next bite! 

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?
Oh no, it's the lionesses

Oh, you are so adored

No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches!

I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised

What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?
Whatever!
Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 
That's it! I need a queen!
A what?

descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
