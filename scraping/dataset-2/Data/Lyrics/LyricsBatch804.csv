Oscar D'León,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",Lady Madonna,
Oscar D'León,"Mira bien lo que hacemos los dos 
Siempre peleando as?br> Si despu?vamos a sonre?
Besarnos mucho m?

Para que acabar este amor 
Amor que es nuestra vida 
Para que destruir la ilusi??br> Y hacer nuestra separaci??br> 
Sufro yo y t?res tambi?
Por cosas sin raz??br> Y el amor en momentos as?br> Muere un poquito m?

Y al morir sufrimos m?y m?
Llorando as?n esta soledad 
Pues sin amor, ni t?yo 
Vivimos m?

Oscar D'León,"No sé qué tiene tu voz que fascina
No sé que tiene tu voz tan divina
Que en mágico vuelo le traje consuelo 
A mi corazon

No sé qué tiene tu voz que domina
Como embrujo de magia a mi pasión

Tu voz se adentró en mi ser y la tengo presa
Tu voz que es tañer campanas al morir la tarde
Tu voz que es gemir de violines 
En las madrugadas

Es el divino poder 
Que tienes en mi bien para enternecer

Tu voz que es susurro de palmas, ternura de brisa
Tu voz que es trinar cenzonte en la enramada
Tu voz cristalina corriente cual, cual una cascada
Dios te bendiga mi bien, tu gracia y tu ser que me hacen soñar 

Tu voz que es susurro de palmas, ternura de brisa
Tu voz que es trinar de cinzonte en la enramada, tu voz tu voz

Oscar D'León,"Sé que tú no quieres
Que yo a ti te quiera 
Siempre tú me esquivas 
De alguna manera 

Si te busco por aquí 
Me sales por allá

No me hagas sufrir más (tú ve')

(Oye, oye bien)
Por tu mal comportamiento, te vas a arrepentir
Bien caro tendrás que pagar todo mi sufrimiento
Llorarás y llorarás sin alguien que te consuele
Así te darás de cuenta que si te engañan duele

Y después vendrás a mí, pidiéndome perdón
Pero ya mi corazón, no se acuerda más de ti

Oscar D'León,"O le canto a la luna
Yo le canto a las flores
Le canto a las estrellas
Le canto a los amores

Yo le canto a los sueños
¡Ay! Cuando digo tu nombre

¡Cómo!

Esta canción no será bonita
Esta canción no estará bien hecha
Esta canción no estará en la radio
Esta canción no me hará una estrella

Esta canción no tendrá armonía
Ni melodía ni buena letra
Ni un estribillo de esos que rompen
Pero la canto porque me llena

Porque no parte los corazones
Porque no pide a nadie que vuelva
Y se compuso con mucha guasa
Está compuesta pa' los que sueñan

Y yo la canto y la canto
La sigo cantando cuando estoy sereno
Cuando estoy borracho

Y yo la canto y la canto
La sigo cantando cuando yo me acuesto
Cuando me levanto

Esta canción no llora por nadie
Esta canción no tiene poema
A lo mejor no andará en tu coche
Pero la canto porque me llena

Esta canción no dice, ""Te quiero""
Y nadie va a cortarse las venas
Esta canción habla muy poquito
Y dice más de lo que aparenta

De esta canción no se harán canciones
Esta canción no estará en baratas
Esta canción no será tu agosto
¡Cuanto lo siento Sr. Pirata!

",La Canto,2006
Oscar D'León,"Se ha retrasado más de una hora
¿Qué pasará que no llega?
Y los deseos de tenerla cerca
Hacen más larga la espera

El tiempo corre y no aparece
¿Habrá olvidado la fecha?
Ya son las 12 y me voy a casa
A organizar mi cabeza

¡Te esperé! nunca llegaste
¿Que pasó? De la cita te olvidaste
Me fallaste

Por segunda vez
No me busques, no me llames
Porque no te quiero ver

Yo tan seguro de que vendría
Ya había ordenado la cena
No imaginé que me haría lo mismo
Que idiota, confiando en ella

Tan preocupado por esa cinta
Y preparando su fiesta
No habrá motivos ni contratiempos
Que justifiquen su ausencia

Yo aquí muriendo por verte llegar
Y me pongo a llorar
Porque no te vi
Entro a ese lugar y allá

Me encuentro a Oscar
Me pongo a preguntar
Y a Oscar le pasa lo mismo que a mi

No sé si fue intencional
O será que de mi te quieres burlar
Otra vez que no llegaste

Pero ya no lo vuelvo a hacer
Pero ya no lo vuelvo a hacer
No confío más en ti

Me fallaste mujer
Otra vez que no llegaste, no puede ser
¡Pero soy feliz!

",Me Fallaste,2006

Ni te preocupes 
Yo estoy contento mami 
Pero no abuses 
Te quise mucho 
No siento odio 
Gracias por soportar

Como la custodia 
Si no tengo a ego 
Pa que la gloria

es convivir con la ansieda 
de no saber si volveras
es quererse morir y no poderlo conseguir

Enseñame a mentir, 
a esconder mi sufrimienrto y sonreir
a arrancarme tu recuerdo de raiz
a no necesitarte a ser como antes

A no despertar lñorando 
porque te volvi a encontrar
en mis sueños

Estar sin ti
es no saber a donde voy
es despertar sin ver el sol
es no tener una razon para poder vivir

de no saber si volveras
es quererse morir y no poderlo conseguir

y en vano tendras que pagar todo mi sufrimiento
lloraras y lloraras sin nadie que te consuele
asi te daras de cuenta que si te engaÃ±an duele

oye mira!
y despues vendras a mi pidiendome perdon
pero ya mi corazon no se acuerda mas de ti

Here I am in the place where I come let go

No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill

Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this

Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees

To be actin' in the drammer?

We've heard say
You are gay
Night and day.

We drink water from a dipper,
You drink champagne from a slipper.

Tho' it seems cruel to bust
All your dreams,
Still I must;
Here's the truth I tell you:
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes;
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.
When you let a feller hold your hand (which
means an extra beer or sandwich),
Ev'rybody whispers: ""Ain't her life a whirl?""
Though you're warned against a ""rout""
Ruining your reputation,
I have played around
The one night trade around
A great big nation:
Wild old men who give you jewels and sables
Only live in Aesop's Fables.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl.

Though we've listened to you moan and grieve, you
Must pardon us if we do not believe you,
There is no doubt
You're crazy about
Your awful stage!

I admit it's fun
To smear my face with paint,
Causing ev'ryone
To think I'm what I ain't,
And I like to play a demi-mondy role
With soul!
Ask the hero does he
Like the way I lure
When I play a hussy
Or a paramour,
Yet when once the curtain's down
My life is pure,
And how I dread it!

Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes,
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.

I would cancel all next season.

Ain't nothin' for a girl!

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

It's terribly sad but true,

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

You didn't need me.

With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day

To tempt me to madness

Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

And only last year
Everything seemed so sure

And he'll be big and strong

I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

Oscar Peterson,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca

For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

The only one my arms will ever hold

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together

Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who

Though by tomorrow you're gone

Dangerous rhythm

It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new
It's very subtle, the Continental

It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion, the Continental

Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So, tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see

I love my mister man,

Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).

But when he comes back that day is fine,

Oscar Peterson,"I used to fall in love with all those boys
Who maul the young cuties
But now I find I’m more inclined
To keep my mind on my duties

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don’t follow through
‘Cause my heart belongs to daddy

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine Finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn’t be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you’re perfectly swell
But my heart belongs to daddy
‘Cause my daddy he treats it so well

There was a dame at a football game
Made long for the strong undergraddie
I never dream of making the team
‘Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn’t be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy

Though I know you’re perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy

Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind

The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

In the arctic ocean

With no insults and all morals

In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

Haunts my reverie

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Oscar Peterson,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
