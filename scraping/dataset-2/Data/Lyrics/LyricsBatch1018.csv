Slim Thug,"You ain't nothing like my last chick
Matter of fact you got me hoping this relationship can last
Ask no questions cause I feel like I been granted my wish(granted my wish)
Been a long time since a brother felt like this (felt like this)
I'm not going to the club tonight I'm staying home
Me and my woman some Isley Brothers and sip this Patron
My homies they be laughin' at me telling me that I'm sprung
But I'm in the zone when it comes to lil mama cause she the one
What I really love about her she don't even need a man
But she follow my lead and respect the fact I wear the pants
And I got no problem hullin' myself cause she my queen
Half the time I spoil her half the time I'm tryin' to get her out her jeans
Z-ro still a gangsta he never been a romantic
He spends most of his time with semi and fully automatics
Although my baby been givin' me reasons to leave the streets
So instead of shootin' up the block I'm a take baby out to eat

Cause she my baby girl
I'm used to the wrong woman
Now I got my own woman
She so good to me she gotta be my
Baby girl

No longer do I have to search
She a diamond she down to Earth
It's Understood to me she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

And every time we sexing
That hidden room is like a weapon
Hey she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

More than anything she my friend
It ain't all about the skins
I don't ever want this to end.

She don't ever have to worry if I'm cheating
I'm on the way home to give that bottom a beating
Even though I'm what they call a rap singer
With business to handle I got time to Carat 
My woman neck and her finger (Yea it's that deep)
She there for me when life get hard for me
And if I get busted she willing to take the charge for me
But I can't see her with handcuffs on for me
Soon as they fingerprint
She go be there with my bond money
Feelin' like Martin Luther King Free at Last
I hate you bitch is a thing of the past
Not totally though I still got up a couple walls
But on the other hand I be feeing for her phone calls
And I'll be mad if I don't get it
I ain't to gangsta to admit it
So don't play with me when I'm stressing
I'll take yo shit and split it
Hell naw she ain't no hoe She my old lady
The one that's go gave 3 or4 of Z-ro's babies

Baby girl
I'm used to the wrong woman
Now I got my own woman
She so good to me she gotta be my
Baby girl

No longer do I have to search
She a diamond she down to Earth
It's Understood to me she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

And every time we sexing
That hidden room is like a weapon
Hey she gotta be mine
Baby Girl

More than anything she my friend
It ain't all about the skins
I don't ever want this to end

When I come home my bath water and my food ready
And that lingerie she be wearin' be keeping the mood steady
Lord Heaven must have got robbed cause an Angel is gone
I'm guilty as charged Lord cause she all up in my home
Just let me keep her I'll protect her from the whole universe
I'll say I do in sickness and in health for better or worse
I'm a still kick it with all four homies alive
When I'm not in Europe letting baby shop until she drop
I'm the King and what good is a Queen if she can't rule with ya
Get out there like one of the homies and act a fool with ya
What's mine is hers she ain't gotta borrow nothing
Watch I'll buy her a beauty shop and a foreign car or something
And what's hers is mine. All I want is her heart
And of Course that secret hidden treasure when her legs come apart
And if I was to ever fall off my game she wouldn't leave me
She'd help me get back on my feet and back on my change!

Slim Thug,"Look I be riding through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip
Same old attitude but I'm on that new shit
They say they gon' rob me, see me never do shit
Cause they know that's the reason that's gone end up on a news clips
Audemar on my wrist, bustdown
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winning touchdown
Remember Meek dead broke? Look at me, up now
I run my city from south Philly back to uptown
Thank god, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped
I done sold a hundred thousand before my album got dropped
And I'm only 23 I'm the shit now look at me
Look at me I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shawty asked me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
'Cause I made it from the bottom there was nothin' on the way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch I'm a boss
I call the shots
I'm with the murder team
Call the cops
We in the building
Y'all are not
You short on the paper, you gon' ball or not

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (ugh) I call the calls (ugh)
We in this bitch
It's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

[Repeat: x6]
Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

I plan the shots, I call the calls

Got so many shades they thought I had a lazy eye
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride
No love cry when only babies die
And when I go that casket better cost a hundred thou
I pray to god I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul up out that shirt let's take him for that ride
OG is one who standing on his own feet
A Boss is one who guarantee we gone eat
Fuck a blog dog cause one day we gon' meet
I'm a spazz on yo ass like I'm on e
Or a double stack better nigga double that
Jerry Jones money nigga you a running back
Herschel Walker, Bo Jack, Ricky Waters
Better run that dope back
Boss, and I put that on my Maybach
Fo' hundred thou' bitch you wish you saved that

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x6]
Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

I plan the shots, I call the calls

Couple cars I don't never drive, bikes I don't never ride
Crib I ain't never been, pool I don't never swim
Fool you ain't better, I move like the president
Err thang black on black you know I be strapp'n that
Rattin' ass niggas walkin round wear'n wires fuckin up the game
Got the hood on fire bitch I'm a king call me sire
If you say I don't run my city you a muthafucking liar
Bitch I'm a boss, you a fraud, you cross the line I get you murdered for a cost
Out in Vegas, I took a loss
At the fight we watchin' Floyd we on the floor
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'm a take yo money
I ain't never dropped a dime
You ain't take nun from me
In the hood err day I'm good what I say

Slim Thug,"[50 Cent]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Little Tyrone Toddy gettin' his ass whipped so he holdin' that gat down
His momma think it's my fault cause he listen to back down
Bobby was a fucking bum he pumpin' ? now 
He keeps her fresh chicks white T's and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock-a-whiner we won't put the yack down
Erica the jump shop but he's smoking crack now
The Lunatics the Lost Boys cheap shit is wack now
Country boots shrowden crackers got him on his back now
And Sean runnin' round with his gat now
Up in niggaz cribs sayin' where that money at pound
And Saundra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travel the world she runnin' round boostin'
And Toya got these bad ass kids they a nusince
Their baby daddy's never come around they useless
Everynow and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white six and some chrome deuce deuce.

[Chorus: x2 50 Cent]
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for being me
Cause I can't change it can't rearrange it I am what I am.
So love me for being me.

[50 Cent]
Now I'ma six man momma told me god don't like ugly
I fell scraped my face and thought god must don't love me
So Owen every morning before he sell dope
Niggas keep whoopin' that ass cause he sell soap.
Charlie be beggin' all the time he stay broke
Flip be down on 109 rollin' up smoke
Chamie he a thief catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crash and need new parts
They say they love me because I rap now but they don't like me
I've been locked up 3 times and they ain't write me
Stevey a pump fucker with Shanqua get mean quick
Pop shots at you he sure must suck a mean dick
The blocks hot D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the building but niggas still be on the grime
Wade used to call the cops and tell them G had a nine
Till G put that gunning down that ?

If a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didn't die in vain, and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin' up on the side of me, side of me

[Bun B]
Man I'm a real trill nigga (nigga) I been out on them blocks
With them hustlers (hustlers) them dealers (dealers) and killers sellin rocks
Put in work in round the clock from when the sun went down
Till it came back up and night came back around (around)
I did a lot of shit them late nights for the dough
Robbin niggaz on the low (low) laughed at 'em then I go (go)
Sometimes it went smooth and nobody got hurt
And sometimes I had to leave a nigga's dick up in the dirt
I ain't proud of what I did and if I could go back in time (time)
I'd try to find another way instead of packin' nines
Totin K's and holdin' macs (macs)
But we know time ain't rollin' back
And hungry hyenas, they ain't foldin' jack
So on these cold and black streets, wolves keep huntin'
And a young black man can lose his life over nothin'
If I gotta go, please let it be for somethin' real
Cause this bullshit hood shit is gettin' niggas killed on the real

[Chorus: x2]

[Bun B]
Well if a deal goes dirty or the counts don't match (match)
Or if I catch a motherfucker dippin' in the back (dippin' in the back)
Say if a nigga disrespect me or my fam
And we take it to the streets and let the guns go blam
I don't really give a damn (damn) or really know whatever's gon' come (come)
And I'm a represent where I'm from (represent where I'm from)
Man I don't wanna die (die) but I ain't scared to (I ain't scared to)
Shit I just wanna make sure that I'm prepared to (I'm prepared to)
Can't leave without a couple tickets in the stands
So my wife, and my momma and my children got cans (children got cans)
Cause once I'm gone who goin' take care of my kids? (take care of my kids)
And do the same things for 'em that I did
Man I'd rather do a bid (bid)
At the least they can see me behind the glass (glass)
Instead I'm reminiscin' bout the past (about the past)
Nigga don't know what he got, until he passes on
So let him tell 'em that he love 'em 'fore his ass is gone

[Chorus: x2]

[Young Buck]
We trappin' hard right across from the graveyard
I just pray to God I don't have to work a day job
Niggas gettin' robbed so I'm ridin' with my A-R
They are, not sendin' tape what I done paid for (no)
Walkin' through the bricks on my Jena 6 shit
Like if you ain't from around here, you was gettin' hit (c'mon)
Send a O.G. some flicks, make they time go by quick (hey)
You surprised what some pictures in the penitentiary did (yeah)
We survived but most of us die for some bullshit
Go to church but the devil's standin' on the pulpit (damn)
Niggas lied just to kick it (what) swear to God they got a meal ticket
Then they call you and they bout to get evicted (I know)
A Underground King, I've been one ever since I was sixteen (c'mon)
Pimp and Bun'll tell you just what Buck mean (what's up)
A street nigga livin' the street dream, I seen (for sho')
My whole team go to the feds or get a hole in the head
This what I said (yeah)

",Underground Thang,2008
Slim Thug,"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
The ghetto motherfucking alarm clock
Wake up nigga

Lord forgive us for sinning, give us this day and our daily bread
Cause if a nigga don't call you back when you beep him, he might be dead
Look at this world we living in, everybody got a bad attitude and a glock
Seem like we living just to become a victim, of a random shot
Everytime I turn my back, another y'all motherfuckers turn and crack
It seem like just yesterday, a young nigga stepped up to the plate and
Learn to bat, military minded at a early age bread to live in a murder maze
I don't want to go to the early grave, a motherfucker like me
Ready to murder maze, I want to go to heaven but not right now
Bout to pushing infrared like dimes, what you want to do it like that
I can play eight to the Penn, cut your lights off right now
Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Chorus: x2]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

(slim thugga motherfucker)

I do this for the block I do this for the hood
I do this for the streets keep me good
I do it for the hustler cause I do it for the thugs
I do it for the G's cause the G's show me love
I came in the game 17 real loud only thing
On ma mind make my mama proud
Started rockin' crowds gettin' dough for show's
And as the fame rolls den came the hoes
Den came the cloths den came the cars
Next thing I know I'ma ghetto superstar
He come the haters travelin' by the packs
But never mind them cause uh bitch I'm back

I pour up a cup fill the swisha with good and fire it up 
So I can gather ma thoughts
(lets get high) Mo money mo problems
They say that's how it is when you live like a boss.
(like a boss) You see I've been goin' on ma grind
For sometimes and the streets thought a nigga fell off
(hell no nigga) But if I decide to rhyme no mo rhymes
I'ma still be well off
(cause bitch I'm back)

A born boss got nothin' to loose
Still shinin' in the game got nothin' to prove
Got rich and independent didn't need no deal
Had paper before I signed didn't need no meal
Got hustles on the side ain't got to rep
And if all else fails I still got the trap
I don't fuck wit you rappers
Y'all fake to me
I don't fuck wit y'all majors y'all snakes to me
I don't care about fame fuck bein' a star
Let them take all the pictures just gimme his car
Den gimme his house and his watch and chain
On the bank account, credit cards jock ma name (Thugga)
But I guess one come wit the other

They say stay true for hits no, fuck it
I'ma gone keep it one-hundred fo the public (that's right)
I dropped all ready platinum but they only sell gold
And niggas lookin' at me like I sold ma soul
Cause I'm rappin' wit P and not mister Lee
But when ya on ya grind sometimes ya can't see
Before Mike Camo Paul the sign
I was at anascope can't find ma mind
Still dippin' wooden poppin' 3 kings just droppin'
And I'm an underground artist tryna get on top
So I listen to ma label, plan to break X and learned a whole lot a game from that.
Just stay true ma nigga and do you
And fuck what another try to tell you to do
They'll tell you to spit backs they can bump in them lexis
And oh yeah this a train track. bitch im back

So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

All my niggas is gone my damn bitch done cut
I got sum shit on my dome
Did they love me or what?
I'm one deep with my chrome like I ain't giving a fuck
If I got to do this alone fuck it that's wassup
They say it's lonely at the top an you
Gon' see who your real friends
No more fo doors I'm riding a coop benz
Keepin' it moving ain't focused on shit but not losing
If you don't fuck with me don't fuck with me
It's not confusing
And when you speak on my name watch the words your choosing
You soundin' like a hater to me it's so amusing
Instead of moving on trying to do your own thang
You recruiting for the we hate Slim Thug gang
But ain't shit change here mayne
I'm still the same
Life good up out the hood shit I can't complain
These niggas say they down, but they just pretend
I'm ridin' solo to the end
Fuck friends

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

Sometimes I wonder if god forgot about me
And would my people miss me if they had to do without me
'Cause anything ain't no love
A nigga you think is yo homie is runnin' up in yo girl every time you leave her lonely
Each and every time I leave my house all three of my guns is on me
Ain't none of you niggas is goin' to
Be kicking or punching on me
And I learned my lesson about callin' my homies when I need 'em
Out of eleven one and a half
Shows up and the rest I still ain't seen 'em
One deep till I'm on my back
Ya'll fellas out might be on my sack
I'll shoot a muthafucker
If a muthafucker jump out of line then I'm a put 'em back in line
2006 beretta, gloc 40 with hollows in mind
It's amazing how something so small can flip yo bitch ass anytime
I'm an og original gangster mayne organized general
Army ready to drop off chemicals
64 545 criminals
But it's business
Whenever I'm seen with a crowd that I'm not feeling
Enter the conversation and paper in my pocket I'm not feeling

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

I done seen a whole lot in these 26 years
Never thought I had peers that was undercover queers
Tell these snitches in my circle awhile back I would've murked yuh
I vouch for me an mine
'Til the gavel drop down
An judge gave my time since I hogged up
The ripper
The last time I heard from my niggas
Still in denial in the begginin' of my sentence
Two months turned to years and them years
Turned to bitches
Sittin' in my cell doin' sets of push ups
No money no mail that's okay that's wassup
Momma made a man but these streets raised
A soldier
Where they kill a real nigga make a mo daycloder
I never fold up
I'm a do my time bitch
I'm a make parole hoe
Get out and shine trick
You fuck niggas better stay out my way
I awready wanna blow off yo face
For violating the code nigga

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch

You thankin' shit fake, well nigga come see

It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin' rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin' any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run dat
Give her ten and tell her don't brang nuttin' back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

I've been paid, I'm just tryin' to turn my mans on

I ""Put On"" for my city like Jeezy's song
Please believe me homes, matter fact check my stats
I ain't drop in three years, but I'm back
Where the money at?
That's the first question
You better pack a strap, that's the first lesson
Hard times got the whole United States stressin'
I'm writin' a book, ""How to Survive in a Recession""
Mr. Obama, we so tired of sellin' crack
If you lookin' for me ask the streets where I'm at

It's home sweet home where the D-boys roam
Movin' stone for stone, or zone for zone
All night gettin' it on 'til 6 in the morn'
The shit I'm smokin' on, stronger then cologne
You can probably smell the smoke through your headphones
If you still broke better get your bread long
Call me on that burner 'cause them feds on my phone
And I'mma run the streets 'til I'm under my headstone

I run, the streets all night and day (The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run, the streets all night and day (If you tryin' to find me)

I guess this why these haters always looking so mad, 
I guess this why this girl want her picture so bad, 
Her heart beating fast while we froze for the pose, 
Before rap I was most chose by the hoes, 
Before you go she slip me something else on the low, 
A rigged out list to see me with no clothes,

I'm so fly, all the haters and the killers try'n get me (get me) when I walk by, 
All the girls wanna take a picture with me (with me) so baby just smile for the camera, (hey) 
For the camera (hey) for the camera (hey) so baby just smile for the camera (hey) 
For the camera (hey) for the camera (hey)

Beautiful by the bar you wanna be a star, 
Look like the boss in a big house and fancy car, 
How bout we make everything that's mine, ours, 
For example let me let you hold the black cards, 
And don't worry bout yo man, he just act hard, 
Before we get to you we gotta go through that squad, 
You like swimming, I got a lake in my backyard

I'll take you on a date till the B team sore

I'm so fly, all the haters and the killers trying get me (get me) when I walk by, 
All the girls wanna take a picture with me (with me) so baby just smile for the camera, (hey) 
For the camera (hey) for the camera (hey) so baby just smile for the camera (hey) 
For the camera (hey)for the camera (hey)

Keep that ice on that chest, and we dress so fly,
And we stay smoking on the best so you know a player so high

So baby just smile for the camera, (hey) for the camera (hey) for the camera (hey) 
So baby just smile for the camera (hey) for the camera (hey) for the camera (hey)",Smile,2009

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Slim Thug,"Comin' up as yungsta
Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)

'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

These niggas holdin the piece, cock the hammer, heard it click
Gun held in my hand, but the glock it didn't spit
Niggas takin my shit, I ran my clothes and my shoes
??? robbin a nigga, kill his ass if he move
But why'all ain't killin Lavell, without a fight tonight

Stick, move, can't, lose, do them shows, pay them dues

These demons searchin for my soul, they gettin closer and warm
Enemies in pale skin in my physical form
No, it's funny, 'cause I don't even mourn for the day
I can't get these white pictures of Jesus outta my head
The preacher's Bible said there's no depiction of Christ
But then they lie to a brother, now my mind ain't right
'Cause if God is white, and black folks ain't shit
But they know that he wasn't, but they couldn't run the risk
Of their town praisin one who looked more like ???
They rather play in my mind and send us all to hell
But I'm here to tell the truth, fuck the myths and the lies
But what's bad they can't even look me straight in my eyes

Slim Whitman,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise thru sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue, my dreams come true

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I am so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils

And my secret love's no secret anymore",Secret Love [From Calamity Jane],2006

And sweep the past away
 
Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire
 
Hollywood ain't paved with gold
It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like el dorado's halls
 
Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Leave behind the mad desire
 
The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scarred
Where only fools find gold

Leave behind the mad desire

The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day

And if I could you know that I would

Comme chacun des sourires que je donne pour paraître heureux
Il paraît que je ne le suis pas
Que j'ai vendu mon âme et pleurniché mais faut pas
Pathétiquement vôtre, comment faire autrement
J'aime la mélancolie de ce monde qui se meurt lentement
J'aime, raconter mes peines mais ne pense pas que je sois faible
Quand je suis à terre, je relève la tête moi
Je me souviens des premiers textes que j'ai gratté
Des premiers refrains avec ma putain de voix cassée
Le feat avec Sofia, premier son qui a marché
Quand l'oiseau de l'amour s'envole, tout le monde se met à l'écouter
À l'époque, je vivais sans un sou
Troubadour dans la rue, parfois saoul
Heureusement j'avais quelques amis
Mounir, grâce à toi j'ai mangé alors merci
À tous ceux que j'ai perdu, tous ceux qui ne sont plus là
Comme j'aurais aimé vous entendre chanter à l'Olympia
Si j'ai la tête dans les nuages, c'est pour être avec vous
Parce qu'ici souvent j'ai l'impression d'avoir fait le tour
Peut-être que je n'étais pas fait pour briller
Et que le succès aurait pu me briser
Peut-être, que c'était trop d'un seul coup
Je voulais qu'on parle de ma musique et non pas de ma sale coupe
Je voulais, qu'on aime mes histoires et qu'on vienne les chanter avec moi
Pas qu'ils attendent que je fasse un faux pas
Faut pas croire tout ce qu'on vous dit
Quand la lumière vient sur toi, elle emporte un bout de ta vie
Heureusement que derrière la cabine il y a les frérots
Sinon ça ferait longtemps que j'aurais éclaté en sanglots
Éclaté ce micro qui m'a pris des moments chers
Maman, pour la première fois j'ai raté ton anniversaire
Pendant un an je n'étais pas là pour mes amis
Eux qui m'avaient soutenu comme une deuxième famille
À tous, je vous promets de faire attention
De ne pas devenir l'outil d'une putain d'ambition
À tous, je vous demande pardon
Et comme d'hab', je le fais en chanson

Moi p'tit gars de banlieue, loin des clichés
Bien, avoue, tu pensais que j'étais bête, tu n'étais pas préparé
À tous ceux qui jugent mais ne font rien
Tous ces frustrés qui ont ri de mes chagrins
Comme j'aimerais vous offrir un cœur
Vous voir enfin, vous aimer sans avoir peur
De ceux qui ne vous ressemblent pas et qui ont le courage
De parler d'amour, de fraternité, de partage
J'ai voulu vous raconter la Lune et le Soleil
À l'heure où j'écris, il se couche, elle s'éveille
À toutes les radios qui m'ont trouvé trop dark pour passer mes chansons
Je viens en quelques larmes, de vous donner raison

Oh, il y a eu tout ça, il y a eu la scène
Il y a eu vos sourires pour effacer mes peines
J'aime vous appeler mes amis
Et vous dire que vous avez changé ma vie

Slime,"In jedem Land, an jeder Grenze
Steht Kanonenfutter schon bereit
Gewehre, Panzer und Raketen
Tag und Nacht allzeit bereit
Und die Spannung wchst, der Krieg ist nah
Und fr dich gibt's keine Chance
Du kannst nur warten, bis die Bombe fllt
Dann gibt's nur noch Tod und Asche
Wir leben in einem Alptraum
Das Erwachen wird der Selbstmord sein
Nur der Tod reibt sich die Hnde
Denn nur er alleine wird
Der Sieger sein
Und die da oben in ihren Palsten
Spielen Poker um die Welt
Denn sie haben ihre Bunker
Wenn der Bombenteppich fllt
Millionen Menschen sind am Verrecken
Doch wir leben in der Fortschrittszeit
Dieser Fortschritt ist der Anfang vom Ende
Denn der Untergang ist nicht mehr weit
Wir leben in einem Alptraum
Das Erwachen wird der Selbstmord sein
Nur der Tod reibt sich die Hnde
Denn nur er alleine wird

Yo - we went from nuttin to somethin, bein real and not frontin
No one was givin us nuttin so we resorted to gunnin
Growin up and we comin, up the ladder not bummin
Dodgin warrants and summons, from the cops we were runnin
Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin
Oh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin
It's a conspiracy hear me man it's got to be somethin
I can get guns faster than I can get an english muffin
And the black church ain't sayin nuttin
We on our own cousin, I'm stickin to this

[Chorus]

I'm livin for this hip-hop, I'm spittin for this hip-hop
I'm givin to this hip-hop, my life is hip-hop
Culture, and y'all know that
Hip-Hop in the media, y'all know it's whack
But just like them dopefiends who keep comin back
Like the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack
No disrespect to either one of them but look at that
Study the metaphors in this rap
We bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it
We bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it
Justice, equality, keep cryin it
But the only way to get it is to start applyin it
Fat Joe that's my bro shows 'nuff respect
Talib, that's my bro, shows 'nuff respect
50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Common! That's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Snoop Dogg is my bro showed 'nuff respect
Dead Prez that's my peeps yo 'nuff respect
Cassidy's an MC who shows 'nuff respect
Hip-Hop is one, don't forget
I'm stickin with this

[Chorus]

I'm livin for that hip-hop culture, shape it like a sculpture
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hip-Hop is yours and mine and that's fine
But hip-hop's culture ain't about just crime
You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher
KRS-One's a teacher
But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community
I'm talkin about unity, in other words you and me
I'm with this

This game real, boy, you can get scarred and barred in it
If your heart ain't in it, caught up in this world spinnin'
Before you started you was finished, dehydrated and deplenished
Niggaz is all washed up without a swallow in they cup
'cause every time a chicken cluck, you trickin' a buck
You pressed your luck and got stuck, fuckin' up the re-up

That's the ones with big talk and no game
Spendin' chips but no change
All the dope and no caine, war stories but no pain
The same ones that pop lip then flag ship
Then gotta hip skip before real niggaz pop clips
You better hop hip

Smokin' weed to calm down, I'm so blown off dust
It's harder to feel pain when my brains is mush
I know it's fucked up, how fathers turn they back on us

And our sick sad mamas smoking crack on up
Slime-ass po-po right in the back of us
Connected muthafuckas got better crack than us
But rich muthafuckas ain't gon' mash like us
Hear sirens coming and continue to bust

Lustful ways, livin' in these mistrustful days
Who said crime don't pay, niggaz out here cockin' K's
Don't drop, they spray, one shot, you lay, toxic waste
One pine box, one case, I'll block yo place

I beat niggaz senseless for Jordans and sixty dollars
Pinned hoes' toes to the earlobes and collars
In the back of a Impala, all to deliver pain
Twist her frame and hear her holler
So savage that it's gettin' harder

For me to see redemption in tomorrow
So far from God that I'm finding righteous paths hard to follow
I'm gulping vodka, I'm killin' sorrow in the bottom of a sky bottle
So depressed and sick and Slimm young and gifted
I'm just sick and twisted

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well

Corner-clockin', in the backroom work-choppin'
From Biscayne to Boat rockin', one-stop shoppin'
Guarded by glock and cash, ain't no stoppin'
They party pill-droppin' till all the drawers droppin'
'Droed up, my niggaz stay poured up, sho nuff

Hold up, big bank we fold up, so who wanna roll up?

All my life I've heard plenty of shit, lots of bull
like you just a nigga, you'll never get a job
so you best be at sellin dope or rob
Learn how to shoot a nine before I come around
Stay down on the ground, sackin every dime
Know a nigga seein hard time
Tryin to skip these lines so everything I knew was big time
Before you slip n slide in the dirt
Great crime, til the church fell down on the niggaz on the block
I gotta get mine to get serious when I'm focused
Call the curtain and misplaced all the searchin
I got partner servin life 
Jackin for small change or cause they foundthe habit or couldn't maintain
We're all lookin for better things
And I heard it in my dream, as she sings

[chorus]
If I give you an inch will you try for the yard
Yeah, if my eyes see it
Well he's laughingright now but I know that he cries
He says it's changin, goes like the wind, just like the wind

[Slimm Calhoun]
Situation haters, tryin to superface me and my cousin
Like a dirty half a dozen was buzzin and caught duckin
Slippin with mine ain't safe
God don't let 'em take me 
He's bucks shake, too late for Pammy, she had to get goin
Like an escaper, it was like a train when I was away
Thank the lord for savin me
Took one for the real trip, too greedy
I tell you y'all niggazis shady, so packed out
y'all play me, fight me with niggazthat sick and consistant
I'm tired of all these kids pullin the trigger to show what they did
Kids in world is so fucked up
Little Joey thought he had to make a kill to be cool
And his best friend dropped out of school
Now where could he be, 
somewhere in the streets slangin keys? I don'tknow
But it's to me you motherfuckers, 
in the dope hangin just as many tryin to rap
And I heard a sayin, in my dream

[chorus]

[Slimm Calhoun]
Currently bitch niggaz is still doin the same shit
Drivebys, get some fo-fos since birth
Clickin work, now, who ain't gonna get hurt
Bystanders, innocent, gettin caught in the firecrossin
And lives bein lost in the mix of ammo blastin, cars crashin, gas
mashin, guns stashin while mothers cry
The fools laughin, get shit happen

Never let the money and these broads break us
We right here till the Lord take us
We act a fool cause the laws make us
Baby, you can't stop the hustle'

[Backbone]
You walk your ass 'cross my yard, get off my grass
You want to get to that money, get off yo' ass
You wants to know my name, you wants to ask
If you want to see me for something, it's going cost ya cash
I see ya poking outcha jeans girl you acting bad
Oh, do that again with you nasty ass
I caught her coming out the mall, with 2 or 3 bags
Now shorty got her at the wood shack, throwing her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubble bath
Catch me somewhere outta town signing autographs
Still working street corners, straight serving them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Chevrolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats
And I'm on the microphone with Gipp, Slimm, and Cass

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Gipp]
Since the trashman only run once a week
If I miss it, I'm wait 'til night and dump it up the street,
behind the Winn-Dixie
Quiver, never step or kept up his penny drawers
To get an applause, appeared to have no flaws
In the situation, no dentition, smelling good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touching up would be too easy
 
Sleazy, measly, looking ugly like a person trying to sell me a dub
Fool A, see, D, and me
Trees ain't my reason for sending your ass to grave and
Watch you say the grade is,
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)
Get the gas to go, at the corner sto'
Keep my hand on the nine piece
In case somebody want to disturb the peace (Always keeping my eyes open)
Cause you, can't, stop the hustle

[Chorus: x2]

[Slimm Calhoun]
Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbing, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out mugging like I'm holding twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block,
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste, just for the taste

I'm ready to flee to a better place
Go West, South, and East, whatever the way
Let's make a move, hurry up lets go now
You got to believe we can get away
I'm tired of doing what the devils say
We got nothing to lose, take my hand lemme help ya
I want to be free, see man brother
I want to be free, help each other
I want to be free, love ya sister
I want to be free, don't you miss her
I want to be free I want to be free

[Kalage]
Master say being born colored was the worst disease
And we the worst to bread, worse than flees
As long as I work for he, I work for free
He beat me like a dick in jail and cursed at me
I'm certain we, weren't put on this earth to be, Bustled
Nobody deserve to be, hustled
Look here, run I dare ya
I catch ya, I'ma give ya more lashes than mascara
If its pride or die, I'm choosing respect
I saw my daddy hung dead, wit a noose on his neck
My niece got raped pregnant, won't tell she scared
Master done it, but she blaming it on drop dead Fred
But one day, things gon' change for better
Lord knows it can't rain forever
that's what I told my momma
Two days later master sold my momma (master sold my momma)

[Chorus]

[Boondox Blax]
uh, uh, uh. I'm in the field, that's white lil' niggas and me
From dusk to dawn til the sun come and it leave
Through all seasons, Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring
Picking, pushing, pulling, cutting the field
Sweating bout to dehydrate, stuck in the heat
and when its cold, joints lock up barker than trees
Rest, I don't get enough of my sleep
cause master got us working late night, and then waking up in the wee
Hours of the morning, stacking stalks of hay
Hoping the rain from dawn til shower day
Wishing I could walk away
But then I think about Hardaway
Master cut off his hand
cause you can't talk or sing or speak from your mouth
If it ain't what master talk or say
But I was taught to pray to the Lord and have faith
Please take me away from this awful place
cause you can be so off today

[Chorus]

[Slimm Calhoun]
Man I tell ya drop shit, ain't nothing
nuff suffering, done dealt with more headaches the buffering
Gotta spend my time off the destructive by getting by doe bubbling
can't risk stumbling, fumbling
So I'm bout taking my life, dice tumbling
I drop down the road, trying to get that pot of gold
Still out in the field, mobbing with Sean and Smoke
9 times, nine to five, I'm troop serving
Nine, you bout trying to eat well, get in line
'cause momma got laid off, the lil' sis need shoes
My brother just got popped back in his county blues
and Pops been made it off, there was no money, no food
Coming through next week, my rent and my girl due
Life ain't got no rules, destruction, one-two's
So every now and then, your gonna sing the blues

Slint,"I stepped out onto the midway
I was looking for the pirate ship
And saw this small, old white tent at one end
It was blue
And had white lights hanging all around it
I decided to check out the tent
It seemed like I could hear music coming from inside
As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow
I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line

I pulled back the drape thing on the tent
There was a crystal ball on the table
And behind it, a girl wearing a hat
She smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read
I said okay
And sat down
Then I thought about it for a minute
And asked her if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead

Creeping up into the sky
Stopping at the top and
Starting down
The girl grabbed my hand
I clutched it tight
I said goodbye to the ground

Far below, a soiled man
A bucket of torn tickets at his side
He watches the children run by
And picks his teeth

Spinning round, my head begins to turn
I shouted, and searched
The sky for a friend
I heard the fortune teller
Screaming back at me
We stuck out our hands and met the winds

The girl falters as she steps down from the platform
She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave
The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready
Who told you that you could leave?

The sun was setting by the time we left
We walked across the deserted lot, alone
We were tired, but we managed to smile
At the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller
The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face
But I could tell she was blushing",Breadcrumb Trail,1991
Slint,"Let me in, the voice cried softly
From outside the wooden door
Scattered remnants of the ship could be seen in the distance
Blood stained the icy wall of the shore

""I'm the only one left, the storm, took them all""
He managed as he tried to stand
The tears ran down his face
""Please, it's cold""

When he woke, there was no trace of the ship
Only the dawn was left behind by the storm
He felt the creaking of the stairs beneath him
That rose from the sea, to the door

There was a sound at the window then
The captain started, his breath was still
Slowly, he turned

From behind the edge of the windowsill
There appeared the delicate hand of a child
His face was flushed and timid
He stared at the captain through frightened eyes

The captain reached for something to hold on to
""Help me,"" he whispered, as he rose slowly to his feet
The boy's face went pale
He recognized the sound

Silently, he pulled down the shade against the shadow
Lost in the doorstep of the empty house

I'm trying to find my way home
I'm sorry
Yeah, I miss you

I miss you
I've grown taller now
I want the police to be notified

I am a prince 
On days I try 
To please my queen 

Soon as I start	to smile
With my smiling queen 
Who sits across the table 
By the food she made

Like a bat I flushed the girl
And I flew out my back door
And I came to no one no more
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train

Eyelids are opened 
When the sun is high
I slip away from my queen's
Grey stare

I can be settled down
and be doing just fine
Until I heard that old train
Rolling down the line

With the light she disappeared
And set me in a whirl
And I hope that beautiful girl
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night

She peeked around the corner
She offered me her hand
My teeth touched her skin

On the strength of your faith

Please
Listen to me
Don't let go
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me
With your empty pillow
Promise me the sun will rise again

I too am tired now
Embracing thoughts of tonight's dreamless sleep
My head is empty
My toes are warm
I am safe from harm",Washer,1991
Slint,"I stepped out onto the midway
I was looking for the pirate ship
And saw this small, old white tent at one end
It was blue
And had white lights hanging all around it
I decided to check out the tent
It seemed like I could hear music coming from inside
As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow
I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line

I pulled back the drape thing on the tent
There was a crystal ball on the table
And behind it, a girl wearing a hat
She smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read
I said okay
And sat down
Then I thought about it for a minute
And asked her if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead

Creeping up into the sky
Stopping at the top and
Starting down
The girl grabbed my hand
I clutched it tight
I said goodbye to the ground

Far below, a soiled man
A bucket of torn tickets at his side
He watches the children run by
And picks his teeth

Spinning round, my head begins to turn
I shouted, and searched
The sky for a friend
I heard the fortune teller
Screaming back at me
We stuck out our hands and met the winds

The girl falters as she steps down from the platform
She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave
The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready
Who told you that you could leave?

The sun was setting by the time we left
We walked across the deserted lot, alone
We were tired, but we managed to smile
At the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller
The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face
But I could tell she was blushing",Breadcrumb Trail [Documentary],1991
Slint,"Goodnight my love
Remember me as you fall to sleep
Fill your pockets with the dust and the memories
rises from the shoes on my feet

I won't be back here
Though we may meet again

I know it's dark outside
Don't be afraid
Every time I ever cried for fear
It was just a mistake that I made
Wash yourself in your tears
And build your church
On the strength of your faith

Please
Listen to me
Don't let go
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me
With your empty pillow
Promise me the sun will rise again

I too am tired now

My head is empty
My toes are warm

Do you want to ride?

Sippin yac, I blacks and the chronic fall
Flashback in on days of me and my Doggs
Said it shouldn't, wouldn't file when it was over but yet it still
Started out, fools for real
Now this of course was back when we sorta lacked this
Wit no paper or dealin with a phone
And I mean this broke shit was gettin old
'Cause we was in need of big clockin dollars
And was in need to clock a mound, uhh, beat em out
Situation became drastic and so therefore
We chose twin hos, some of those cum-on-their-lipstick tactics
Now low and behold, well I'll be goddamned
If the stack didn't increase ten-motherfuckin-fold
Must you cover that rolo again 'cause we was trippin
To stay up on top of things, the ???? life we was livin
Strictly business, we was in this to win it all
Didn't give a fuck if no others didn't love us, me and my Doggs

Now this is how it's done like one two three
If the motherfuckers serve tryin to step to a G
Only got love for me and my Doggs
With Capone on a mission with that nigga Boss Hogg

Now this is how it's done like one two three
If the motherfuckers serve tryin to step to a G
Only got love for me and my Doggs
With Capone on a mission with that nigga Boss Hogg

On a mission dippin down Imperial
The name's Capone but first let me inforward the scenario (yeah)
Creepin, holdin one wing to weaken
In a BMW, there they go, I see them (who?)
Them fools across me when I first started off
With the kingpin Kurupt and a G named Boss Hogg
But now I got a stack of Columbian crack
I gots ta cook it in seven so a nigga can make his ends back
Prepare to murder if I have to and I had to
So I blasted the two in front and got the last few
No one escapes as Capone demonstrates power
And regulates the Westside's leading white powder
Separates the boys from the men, you see who's your true friend
And who ain't when you begin stackin ends
That's why I never love no one but myself
There ain't a nigga crossed me that lived to tell (BLAOW!)

Liten now who's a rather step would be (She gotta look when)
See we Kurupt, BG, who? What? (Simply not to be fucked with)
Best to be on your guard
We was stalkin the fuckin boulevard, really lord
But since it wadn't enough for the two-man crew
We disinobeyed em, contemplating on parlaying product in the revenue
Thought about it a minute then we concluded
We're been stupid as fuck not to get up in it
So we's like ""Shit! We had to do it!""
Servin them cavi to make the cash flow, just to let em roll through it
And so we gathered up the proper amounts
Bought ourselves a flight o' motherfuckin birds and me and my niggas sat
Down
(To defeat the rest
So we shook the fuck up from the east to west)
Came up large and come out at ease
Niggas started recitin philosophies like 'True as a rainbow'
Yes why'all niggas was born into bawlin
Since they was swimmin in Pop's balls
And all of a sudden I started noticin decreasin my grip fingers
And I'm like ""What? Hold on, wait a minute""
Wassup nigga with this shortness of my green
He looked me in my face and said ""Fuck, you think of me""
And right before my eyes the partnership dissolved
I sent him like he was a ho, showed him no love at all
He reached for his Glock but I was quicker BLAOW!
Used to be my homey but you's a dead motherfucker now
I'm ashamed but I say fuck it, the day I became the Boss Hogg
'Cause today I buried my Dogg

Check it
This just a quick reminder to let all why'all motherfuckers know
There ain't no friends in this game
Especially when you're dealin with half white and black hearted, cross
Eyed, curly haired motherfuckers, knowI'msayin?
The name's Capone puttin it down with big CPO Boss Hogg
For a second to let all why'all motherfuckers know that it's a cold world
Niggas gotta supply they own hate, realise and analyse that shit ya did",The Eulogy,1994

Went from weed and dope to mics ta sell

Bout it bout it do ya got it

Get cha' walk on, see-walk homie, see-walk homie 
Get cha' walk on, see-walk homie

Verse 2: Tray Deee
Yeah ima tell you like this Kurupt, you know how it was for me
Been regarded as the hardest since I hit the set
Young nigga with a rep, kept that gangsta step
Crocka sacs of blue cordiroy with house shoes on
Flawssin for the hoodrats gettin my groove on
Hangin in the park till all hours of dark
Tryna catch a mark slippin wit this thang that bark
Cry baby on the swamp got the exit locked
And ain't no doubt comin out he gone wreck ya not
Pass me the satin locs so I can wet my throat
While I sag the blue khakiswit tha raoder coat
All the hoes really want is gangstaz just like us
Ruff and don't give a fuck ain't that right Kurupt (thas right)
Stay bangin on these niggaz on a regular basis
Big paper chasin, facin felony cases
Made it to be famous, livin hard and dangerous
Steppin on these bustaz wit my blue chuck taylors

Chorus:

Verse 3: Slip Capone

You know that ganstaz rock, gangstaz roll
Here's the gangsta shit, we on a gangsta stroll
Its gangstaz ride, gangstaz slide 
Then the gangstaz rob with the gangsta glide
'cause gangstaz move, and gangstaz groove
And most gangstaz got nuthin ta lose
Gangstaz live, and gangstaz die
Gangstaz form a gang and the gang multiply
Gangstaz give a fuck a g, don't ask why
Gangstaz don't snitch, and gangstaz don't cry
Gangstaz boogie, gangstaz don't dance
Gangsta pull the strap out cha' pants and blast
Gangstaz don't run, and gangstaz don't hide
Ima gangsta ass nigga from the sick southside
That's how I know exactly what a gangsta do
Ya love the gangsta shit ain't you a gangsta too?

(Aah)
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California hoes

California bitches
(Tim dog)
Some bad hoes
Bitch you digging in the wrong dirt bitch
Ain't no gold in here
Fucking with the wrong niggas
Knoc-Turn'al, Slip Capone, Short Dog

I knew a tight white bitch named Marianna
She lived right around the corner from Temecula
See I was bored, I fucked both of them whores before
So I called my other bitch Elsinore

She wasn't cracking
So I called up Hesperia and Monrovia and Valencia
I got some pussy from Pomona and her sister Corona
It ain't nothing like them hoes in southern California

I knew a bitch named Irvine
She had a cousin with the name Santa Ana
It was short for Anaheim
I got high in Riverside with Receda and Rosarito
And Santa Clarita and [unverified]

I'm pleased to meet you
I've been all around the world
And with over a thousand girls
And homeboy I don't know what you have been told
But Eskimo pussy is mighty cold
(Brrr)

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

You might be gold
But lately I been doing the platinum pose
Knoc-Turn'al's on 128 girl
What? I'll be right over

Magazines choreograph me in photos
I put out with three dime pieces slamming four doors
And if I can use cities in relation to hoes
I probably fucked San Fernando's daughter, Santa Barbera

And her best friend Alameda and Sierra
And Ramona's little sister Covina
And I don't know what you thought
Whether you turned the cat in the night bitch

Still the only manipulation weapon you got
Knoc-Turn'al ain't the one to fall victim to your plots
Before I save a hoe from the block
Her great grandchildren's corpses will rot
Fuck a hoe

I'd rather have money and a multiple round spitting glock
Four mansions with multiple cars investing my chips in stock
Even if I can't spell dow jones I still pull out fat knocks
It don't stop

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

They say this is a man's world
Can't understand it girl
All you ever wanted was a man like Chante Moore
You know us ballers never have one woman

And when you need us we never come running
That's why now you think about your ex again
You want to page him just to have sex with him
But instead you better call your next of kin

And complain these ballers won't let you in
She don't love you she loves money and sex
Bitches shoot you in the head for a Rolex
I know the bitch is a dick fiend

I fucked her one night when she was sixteen
I know it seems like a long time ago
But I fucked her again when she was twenty four
Bitch, I'm an old school vet, they call me Too $hort

Look your woman in the eyes
What she do it for? Biyatch
You know these hoes man
They'd do anything if they think it's for the money, that's why

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us

Got cash sniffin' noses

Hang with my crew blue strings in my shoes
Mary Jane and some loop while we swags in the coupe
I'm addicting to smacking hoes
Tracks, flows Crenshaw Boulevard backing foes

L.A.'s Finest and L.A.'s behind us
Gangsta, hoochies, essays and whinnies
D's still twisting, low low's still hopping
Gangsta shit still dropping, Crenshaw still popping

Gang signs throwing up, body's still showing up
And O yea Time Bomb still blowing up, bitch

The Dogg Pound stays the learn all y'all heard
Please date me when stick before you get serve

You know gangstas bang and gangsta slang
It's just an gangsta thang
Gangstas dip and some gangstas trip
I'm the gangsta slip and this gangsta crip

I used bump brother with the gangsta nip
'Cause nobody else was on the gangsta tip
Gangstas smoke sh room and gangsta rock perms
Gangstas don't listen and gangstas don't learn

Gangsta rock braids and gangsta jerry curls
Gangsta's going take over the world
Gangsta's go to jail, gangstas skip bail
Gangsta's make mail and gangsta's would never fail

Gangsta's goin' stay on top
Because the gangsta is going to make the gangsta shit pop
Just lounge homeboy you in the gangsta zone
Heart thrown in California where the gangstas roll

Let's all roll, throw it up if you with me

The Dogg Pound stays the learn all y'all heard
Please date me when stick before you get serve

My nigga slip is an gangsta
'cause I'm an hood ster, an hood star I'm taking the hood far
The see Riders posted up with the bullet loco blue rags
Smoking the bombing fluid and keep dumping on you fags

I heard and seen it all and I'm hoping you fall
Keep looking at my nuts until I get crip ball
I'm still striving, yeah ya word is about what I'm driving
Your bitch is going me more, pedal to the floor

Fuck an navigator, nigga I can flip ten gators in my living room
If you can't to that nigga give me room
Had an tourney 89' but your bitch made me mine
See the mother fucker ran on that biz state of mind

For mine I did the crime, had to run one time
And you take my dick in your mouth in one time
I fuck you in the butt and crip walk your liver
While I rich roll on the river

Caught up in the land of hard time
Back off mine, I'm mad I'm pushing an hard line
An hard cat with hard raps and hard rhymes
I hardly pay attention to rap

My mine say hard dick serve to an bitch ain't no crime
Hood soft to hard dime, chicken way I flip mine
Hard hit and rip like canines, hit hard heads with no spine
March and start to take mine

Big D let me fuck that bitch and you fuck mine
Off hard liqueurs is harder than wine Knoc-Turnal comes through overtime
When I die build me an shrine all is all is getting in my mind
I ain't begun to speak yet, until that time

Let's throw it up, throw it up
Let 'em know, out in the west represent let it gold
Let's throw it up, throw it up

Now this is how it's done like one two three
If the motherfuckers serve tryin to step to a G
Only got love for me and my Doggs
With Capone on a mission with that nigga Boss Hogg

Liten now who's a rather step would be (She gotta look when)
See we Kurupt, BG, who? What? (Simply not to be fucked with)
Best to be on your guard
We was stalkin the fuckin boulevard, really lord
But since it wadn't enough for the two-man crew
We disinobeyed em, contemplating on parlaying product in the revenue
Thought about it a minute then we concluded
We're been stupid as fuck not to get up in it
So we's like ""Shit! We had to do it!""
Servin them cavi to make the cash flow, just to let em roll through it
And so we gathered up the proper amounts
Bought ourselves a flight o' motherfuckin birds and me and my niggas sat
Down
(To defeat the rest
So we shook the fuck up from the east to west)
Came up large and come out at ease
Niggas started recitin philosophies like 'True as a rainbow'
Yes why'all niggas was born into bawlin
Since they was swimmin in Pop's balls
And all of a sudden I started noticin decreasin my grip fingers
And I'm like ""What? Hold on, wait a minute""
Wassup nigga with this shortness of my green
He looked me in my face and said ""Fuck, you think of me""
And right before my eyes the partnership dissolved
I sent him like he was a ho, showed him no love at all
He reached for his Glock but I was quicker BLAOW!
Used to be my homey but you's a dead motherfucker now
I'm ashamed but I say fuck it, the day I became the Boss Hogg
'Cause today I buried my Dogg

Check it
This just a quick reminder to let all why'all motherfuckers know
There ain't no friends in this game
Especially when you're dealin with half white and black hearted, cross
Eyed, curly haired motherfuckers, knowI'msayin?
The name's Capone puttin it down with big CPO Boss Hogg
For a second to let all why'all motherfuckers know that it's a cold world

It never ends, and with the gifts Luna sends, to the apocalypse

For our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled

As Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm

All the power of the Wyld that runs through me, 
Yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me

That black inside when frenzy is brewing

Slipknot,"Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing mode of pleasure
A pleasure that will take my mind off the reality of life
My past life
Life as I know it know
And whatever may come it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there until I wish to retrieve it

Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands

It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it

Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had
Broke away my tear spout!

As I lie here
With my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me
A sweetheart tube
As I injected
The candid heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate
Just do what you like to do to me!

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin.
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel.
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway.
Just let the blood run red, 'cause I can't feel!

Gotta retract, everybody get back
What is this? it's like a big conspiracy
Fields of dejected morbid progeny
They always say that it's always our fault
But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt
Man, it's always the same, if we talk or complain
We only want to upset the balance

The only generation to suffer extortion

But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside
If the pain goes on

I've waited last, my time's elapsed
Now, all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on,
I'm not gonna make it

Pull me back together
Or separate the skin from the bone
Leave me all the pieces, and then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than dream
But I found out the hard way,
Nothing is what it seems!

It isn't just a one sided version
We've dealt with a manic subversion
I won't let the truth be perverted

We fight 'till no one can fight us
We live and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
We never had to fight in the first place
We only had spit back in their face
We won't walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger

Fell forth, destroy the source,
can't see and my voice is horse,
Trying to wash your hands off,
You should know better than to leave us in disgust,

Let me take you right to the point,
All you ever do is encage in disjoint,
That does it the time has arrived,
Take it or leave it you better not side!

You did it again,
All you ever did was doubt,
What do you want?
Let me tell you what it's all about,

One life
Nine Hearts
And Eighteen Hands that'll rip you all apart

We're here to decimate,
To show you all we will never fall,
Its gonna get serious, and critical,
Don't Stop because the feeling is terminal,

Scream like you never have before,
Scream!
Scream till you can't scream anymore,
Scream !
Scream like your throat is bleeding,
Scream!
Scream till your heart stops beating,
Scream for me!

Get off of me, and get away,
Show the whole damn world this will never die,
No matter how the energies scatter,
Got to know nothing exists but the dream,

Give it all,
Till There's nothing left to give,
Save it all,
Quit saving you,
If you're going to let the pain inside,
Never under estimate the way you live your life,

All our lives,
All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything,
Everything is possible to me,
Why no fate,
Found everything that I had to take away,
Save your life,
Save it all that mean something to me,

All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fight!
Found everything that I had to take away,
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way,

This stress, is a feeling that you can't compress,
Everything your going through is total stress,
Are you going to be a momentary run around,
How will you handle their ? of stress,

All we ever sacrificed has paid,
Everything,
Everything is possible to me,
Why no fight,
Found everything that I had to take away,

Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please  all I see is hate

Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out

Lost, ran at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, all around me, weak, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one your dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

There is something inside me
There is something in you I despise

Post-traumatic war machines, the pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes, it's all I can to feel
Let my weapons be your children, let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence, try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, one day, we'll live our lives again

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own
I am something now that never could exist
My anguish conquers all, pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken, my broken key is only? Me

They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

Baby girl I'm calling to you
I know you can hear me somewhere
I can't believe that I don't have you
It feels really lost and unfair

But we were such a beautiful love
'Til we let trouble come our way
Why did I hurt you baby almost every day?

It's been a while since you left me girl
And I don't feel sorry for myself
You might think that I don't care or I moved on
Or seeing somebody else, oh, no, no

I remember yelling at you and hurting your heart baby
The way I treated you I wouldn't even treat my enemy

Wanna get you back my beautiful baby
Come on girl we'll make it one day
Every time I made you cry forgive me baby
Come on girl we'll make it one day

I can't go with my life without you baby
Come on girl we'll make it one day
I would rather stay alone than not have you baby
Come on girl we'll make it one day

When my life started going the wrong way
You did everything for me
You were there for me every single day
Loving and trying to help me

I was frustrated with my problems
And took it all out on you
Looking back it hurts me so much
Can't believe what I put you through

It's been a while since you left me girl
And I don't feel sorry for myself
You might think that I don't care or I moved on
Or am seeing somebody else, oh, no, no

Have to reach out to you even though
You don't wanna see me or talk to me
I believe that I'm a better man
Give me a chance so you can see

Wanna get you back, my beautiful baby
Come on girl we'll make it one day
Every time I made you cry forgive me baby

I can't go with my life without you baby

I would rather stay alone than not have you baby

I'm not an evil person, baby
Don't wanna live without you, going crazy
All I want is for you to give me a chance
To get back the love we had

I miss you girl, I miss your loving
Know for the fact that you're my woman
Forgive me please, I know we can make it one day

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game

Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood

Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I felt like an ass 'cause I was one

I just ate my young

She is obviously a person with a cause
I told her that I don't smoke or drink
She told me to loosen up on her way to the L.C.

She skips her classes and gets good grades
I go to my courses rain or shine
She's passin' her classes while I attend mine

While I attend mine
While I attend mine
While I attend mine

She wrote out a story about her life
I think it included something about me
I'm not sure of that but I'm sure of one thing
Her spelling's atrocious

She told me to read between the lines
And tell her exactly what I got out of it
I told her affection had two F's
Especially when you're dealing with me

I usually notice all the little things
One time I was proud of it, she says it's annoying
She cursed me up and down and rolled her are's, her beautiful are's

She says I'm caught up in triviality
All I really want to know is what she thinks of me
I think my love for her makes me miss the point

You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off

And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics

On every field of green
There is a silver sheen

And this Indian Summer, It's made me sick
I don't use the phone, I don't write no letters
All I can do is lay here and sweat

And this wretched house, It falls down around me
The air has turned foul, the walls have turned brown
And they rot in the glow of a single light bulb
Once there was paint, now there's just dust

Lay somewhere else, beyond these crops
But she couldn't speak, and they wouldn't listen

Tryin' to grill food on a rusted out grill
Drinkin' a beer and burnin' our fingers
Watching the dog pee on the car

And the trees all look sick now and the grass has turned brown
And the bird bath's broken, and the fence fallen down
And the gate, it hangs crooked on rusted out hinges
And the heat never leaves when the sun sinks down

And once we had meaning, but now, we're just hollow
Once we felt pain, but now we're just numb
Once there were words, but now there's just glances
And once we were smart but now we're just dumb ...

The woods were damp and the air was green.
A beautiful spring morning, now what could serve as warning.
And I'd often seen it, rotten wood and broken bricks,
A long rope and a pail, and a hole going straight to hell.

And your big brother, you'd do anything to catch his smile
But you couldn't catch him runnin', so you'd just duck and hide for awhile.
And I didn't hear you, I didn't even try
I was a hundred yards away and I thought you'd run off somewhere to play.

The ground was clay, we dug a shallow grave.
And laid ourselves to sleep, there just outside the fields where we once played.

And I'd like to hear you when you say that you messed up

Well there's sanity for starters, oh hell, I'll just make a list.

And, yeah, I'm getting married, so just let me clear the air
Hell no, you're not invited, but I know that you don't care
And you'll be there with guns and goofy ribbons in your hair
So I made me a big ol' sign says: ""Crazy, jilted hag! Beware!""

And the car in the lane next to me was driven by a little boy
And he flashed a smile at me then he drove straight off the road
Smacked an overpass, I watched his car explode

There's holes in these walls all so covered with grime

It's just toothpicks and twine, some matchsticks and paste
But it's all too late now, oh my god what a waste
And I feel the ground shaking, I hear a strange sound
Hey Baby, it's the end of the world, I will see you around
Affection is earthbound, our crushes of stone
But these all fall away, still you're never alone
When your one mode of function's steadfast deconstuction
Of attachments once forged with a fiery rambunction
And I can't help but think way before the big sink
That the streets of Atlantis already held a stink
And I can't help but know way deep down in my soul
That the best has already come and now it's time to go
So sign all your yearbooks, give a last glance

There's a few things I need and ones a friend
A few good games of pinball and a double whiskey sour
I'll rinse it with a beer and repeat again

You know I couldn't find you in the place you used to be
I'm a sucker for the old times, that's me
But I asked around the bar and they said you were gone for a couple of days
On a vacation in the drunk tank so they'd say

I saw that girl you used to know at the other end of the bar
I never thought she'd ever get that far
She said you two were through, it seemed you were driving for different things
I said I understood, I've wrecked that car
So now there's thirteen empty bottles, a glass or two or four
The lights came on we headed for the door
But the night was adolescent and she said she wanted more
And that's what she kept the apple blossom for
So up the stairs to her apartment with the Christmas lights that blink
It's the second week of May but that'd be okay
Except that under those blinking lights we opened a big old can of stink
And you smell it soon enough in one more day

Saturday, the twelfth of May, the policeman turns the valve
And the first drunk of the weekend dribbles out
Collect all your effects and take a cab straight to the bar
You're wondering what the whisperings all about
Well I'll tell you:

It's about the easy sheen of alcohol, of better-not-do's done
Of blinking lights and the curse of roomates' tongues
An entire bar's worth holding theirs, but it only takes just one
And then it's pass that can around, it's your turn, son
Because this pinball gane I'm playing, you know it's not the same

Times used to be you and me could always match
Yeah and the multiball came easy just like the replay game
And the wagers won and tossed hard down the hatch

Sloppy Seconds,"People are telling me
That I'm missing out on the fun
'Cause I don't go anywhere
And I don't meet anyone

But I know how rumors fly
When you're a lonely guy
And I'm here to tell you it's a lie

There's strange things going on
At night most everywhere
You know those places well
And you've never seen me there

I walk by other men
And I don't notice them
But then those rumors start again

So I'm gonna tell the world
I don't wanna be a homosexual
I'm gonna find a girl
'Cause I don't wanna be a homosexual
I guess that it's okay
If other guys are gay
But my hormones are one-directional
And I don't wanna be a homosexual

Somebody tell me what I did to start this talk
Is it the way I look; is it the way I walk?

Is it the clothes I wear
That make the people stare?
Is it the way I comb my hair?

I'm only hoping maybe there will come a day
When I can make them understand that I'm not gay

But till that day is here
I guess I'll live in fear
And I curse the day I pierced my ear

There's nothing wrong with me
I don't wanna be a homosexual
Know what I want to be
And I don't wanna be a homosexual

Soft boys and closet queens
Think Judy Garland's keen
But I don't think she's nothing special
And I don't wanna be a homosexual

So now I'm wondering if maybe they're not right
I've gone all paranoid and I can't sleep at night

I went to see the shrink
What did the doctor think?
I swear to God I saw him wink

I pray that I am wrong
I don't wanna be a homosexual
Why did I write this song
If I don't wanna be a homosexual?

I hope it's not too late
For them to set me straight
I'm gonna see a real professional
'Cause I don't wanna be a homosexual

No
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no

I don't wanna be a homosexual . . .

I don't wanna go with guys named Seamus
I don't wanna be rich and famous
I don't wanna go to a French art festival
I don't wannt be a homosexual

And I give the keys to some teethless hick
Who picks his nose and spits
I want him dead!

And later on I go to shop for clothes
And the sales clerk strikes a snotty pose
""Can I help you with those?""
I want him dead!

And every time I see that stuck up topless dancer
I only want her to grow old and die of cancer
Cause I wanna set a bonfire in her hair
See her fry in the electric chair
Cause that's how much I care
I want her dead!

And I ask myself well how can it be right
To wish these awful deaths on people day and night
But when I ask why that's the way that it must be
I only tell myself 'well better them than me'.

Cause it's not that I'm such an awful guy
Don't ask me cause I don't know why
But certain people must die
I want 'em dead!

Yeah, I wish they'd take a leap from a windowsill,
Or overdose on sleeping pills
Curiosity kills
I want 'em dead!

Everyone who's afraid to dance
And everyone who wears panters' pants
And the whole nation of France
I want 'em dead!

You better take a dive on a live grenade
Or slit your throat with a razor blade
I wish you'd all get aids
I want 'em dead!

Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

Slow it down the slow motion
Laugh at my pain I ain't joking
Blood from a stone, hands open
Blood on my hands for my bloods that are broken
Head to big, it’s swollen
Hot in the bits like Moulton
Negative life, stop moaning
Too many things I hold in
I ain't learnt till my legs start floating
Disconnect everyone I don’t like, Don Perrione hype
Catch me in the club, I be selling Snow White
Impose yourself, you might get a goodbye
Pressurise me and get something in your eye
From a yout, the boy has been a savage
Rudeboy deal with the matter
Different planet like I came from Namek
My life they can’t understand it
From a yout, the boy has been a savage

Slug,"[Verse 1 : Slug]
It was a purple-purple sky and an orange-orange moon
And everyone was whistling the same damn tune
Except Brian, Brian staired out across the field
And watch the horizon blossom to cop a field
Over the edge of the world
The one they're all afraid to walk
Ration out the why they're so high on the small talk
But Brian knows where the crows all go
To find the if's, and the and's and the but's and also's

Chorus:
If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light
I?d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock
I?d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block
But as it stands, I stay content
Tryin? to be the magic man, and pay my rent
Wishing that Brian would turn me on to the secrets he sought
While we keep burning the dawn, just to keep the day hot 

[Verse 2 : Slug]
If I could ask you one question, I?d ask where you went
You could teach me a lesson every time I got bent
But the alcohol don't make me forget about it all
doesn't matter the season the leaves can still fall
They slipped hidden messages within the cards that were dealt
I understand myself and all of the sorrow I felt
For as simple as I'am how'd it get so complex
Got me studying the margins and disregarding the text
I open the curtins and listen to the traffic go
But I still get nervous each time my peace passes go
The residue is thick and the memory fails
I still laugh 'cause the path feels a lot like a trail

Chorus:
If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light
I?d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock

But as it stands, I stay content
Tryin? to be the magic man, and pay my rent

[Verse 3 : Slug]
We used to be a couple of pimps walking the hallways with pride
Drunk or sober, life was nothing short of rollercoaster rides
Trip to the clubs, now the skull to the rhythm
All we wanted out of life was what was given
And when you passed I wanted to take back the time we wasted
I'd trade all the buzzes in for one more conversation
We can sit in the shade and discuss the meaning of sacred
Cause I can't see the garden no more, just the avens
But the wind still blows and the plains still grow
And I wish your name was on the guest list at my shows
I got to believe you can see me run up on my freedom
Cause you got to meet up with the son before you got to meet my son

Bridge (x2):
And when I see lightning, feels like my buzz is heightning
Everytime I feel the sun, I can smell the love
And when I smell the air I can hear a child trying
But everytime I hear a river I think the mother is crying
",River,2002
Slug,"Would you believe there's only four more people in the world
And when you're not looking they change masks
Somewhere over the rainbow it's the same
Instead of needle infested train tracks
No matter how fast you run from the eye you hate
There is no escape (There is no escape)
So I wait for the heaven that I seek
Which makes everything insignificant differences
Innocence intendance the vision amongst religion
Visioning innovative criticisms are the state of mind we're living
Time is ticking
If you listen to the sign that wisdom efficiantly spreads
Sing a song that officially deadens the mission
They cling on the friction
I stand stiff in this position
Plans shift
Cause to me your man is in an issue of your ego tissue
Explicit to the point of non-existence
And life in the past is your only interest
I used to build forts in the backyard to hide from the daytime
Missing all the beauty of the sunshine
It's my fault
But I blame the world to a small degree
I've never seen the sky cause I been too scared it would fall on me
So what? You're mad cause I don't want to talk?
But you'd be even more pissed off if I told you what i really thought
So just walk away (just walk away)
You're better off never caring what I say (never caring what I say)

I been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm high on mental piation
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free
Kill my dedication
Put me on your medication
Drop me off in space and never come to get me

Well
Something in the air make me not want to care
Let 'em stare until I'm riding on an empty spare
Follow the vein straight
As it drapes across the landscape and the sand and the lake
Off the beaten path
Learn the secret math
Keeping the laugh, smug
Too deep in the back of luck
Happy as fuck
But nobody's convinced
Play daddy to the love and try to drop a couple hints
Ever since I came to learn all the right turns
I was cursed with the cigarette burns and the lost words
Found inspiration inside your misery
Always trying to take an inch
More than what they're giving me
Dear God
Let me die on the rich people's lawns
Because I'm not so sure they're gonna learn my songs
Every morning he repeats that same shit
Spends the day trying to be famous
Well another day, shot
And I'm thinking this aquarium is deeper than the last one
My castle was never made of sand
It's one big aluminum can
The chateau of the damned
The shadow of the man you pretend you are
Had a rough thought that got caught and went too far
If I did have a car I'd go broke from the gas
On the shoulder of the road
As you roll past

I been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me

Get yourself together now because it's hit time
Your known as the hit makers
Breaker breakers, party makers
They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver
For all you cats, who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
If you don't dig that you gotta hold your soul
If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
Because singing might be loud and clear

[Brother Ali]
Ayo, the music made ‘em jump back
Fuck that, how y'all gonna come tracks, some fat, without lettin Ali touch that?
Gun whack, read his lips
You're not serious, I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is)
A seasoned veteran, an ego reckon
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Y'all ain't fuckin with the ox so put your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons
So no

Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage
Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it, the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Sluggo, even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though

Don't stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs (ohh yeah)

You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers

I write poems, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho

Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on about it
I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass
with your tongue out and write a love song about it

We can go toe-to-toe cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, ""That's all you got?""
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice quit talking it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit - you don't chew, you don't breathe
You'll miss a fucking line
Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot
Leave me in the deck too long I blow up your box: boom!",Boom,2009

God is the highest form of living mind math and matter 

Negroes, complete the data 

Your nation's lacking, you're at the bottom of the living line 

Why? Cause Whitey screwed your simple mind 

You was a God now you're the sucker of the planet Earth 

And crowned your woman slut of the universe 

Pimping, leaning, fiending, scheming 

Trying to be the cooleest nigga for some frozen other reason

Revive the nigga genes revoked while playing cute

Strong tug to mic cord, submits my guillotine 

To eat 'em up and split 'em, 'nuff heads is rolling down 

Degrading gangsta lean, black hole is going down 

You're mudbone, and I stand with ranges shown

Translating my heat to unreachable degrees

To go up to the boat, and start robbing old folks
Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild, yo, check it

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib, it wasn't involving him
Four in the morning, my phone ringing
I'm thinking, ""Who the fuck is this,"" on the other line screaming
Told em, ""Keep down,"" but they was breathing hard
It was my grandmother telling me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezing but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat getting bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while
Not gambling but every now and then they'd smile
Then blow! They had Mag's
And told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzing, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hanging off they ass
Got her some water, and begin to think
How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
Cause yo, it's the big payback

Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggas probably knew something plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playing Jigga
Discussing how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggas next to me, was talking bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nothing
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticing these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talking if they did it, it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring
This Hype came in, selling CD's, said the BD's
Was bragging bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinking bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run
It's the big payback

My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinking when shit went down, I was I was there
Fucking with fam' who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pouring liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me running in place, it's getting tricky
(like who?) like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's, I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck

Three-alarm fire and a possible homicide
The building is entitled ""The Ultimate Barbershop""
There are six unidentified bodies in the building

I repeat they are all presumed dead

I'm tryin to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider ridin she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus, you got a man but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And, he wanna know where you are where you be
Where you going where you today where you started to be (Damn)
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you been
Say, he the type of nigga that's still cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to style in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good it sound tainted to me

Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love

How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doin exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spendin your cash flow cause she was so out hoe
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose thet brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for day, everything in life is just ok
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's ok cause your a star for the day
People a smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free
Love is always free love is always free

Real love, true love, tainted love, real love
True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real

You say you love me but is it really real
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feelin ill
Would you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day
Dinner by candlelight but your the main entree
And if so I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailin rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience with someone who want in they life span, the same

Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love that's real
I would never want nothin tainted
Wait a minute what you feel
Faded if your lovin was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh do you, be, alright
(T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time y'all come on)
If you, be, alright...

One bullet to start a war and be a part of gore

Causing the illest niggas to switch and spit what they ain't feelin'
One! Day a time of alcohol it takes to get by
Is worth more than a mini puff it takes to get high
One, Love was the joint that my cousins used to break dance to
Before they began to pop and lock with the glock handle
This one turn for the worst, my main concern for the earth
'Cause it seems to get even worse when it turns
Purposely burn an emcee, fricassee his hand holding the mic
So he can't fold it to write

Also we fearsome
Known as the Slum and that's just one organism
One crew comin' through 'cause we gotta hit 'em

Soon as I'm done with these silly little rap scrubs
Soon as I'm done making my rap million dollar hits

Waiting for the chance to get to date you

Sure need you around when its all those
Listen, I'm not saying this to offend you
But since the day I met you I knew I would bend you, over
Not saying its about that
Its about us bending like vocals on ill tracks
Classic, like a novel by Stephen King
Always resting by the revel where a social reign
Sex, its the farthest thing from my mind
I'm thinking how we get together like the starter line

This is, one page out a black book
This is, how it goes when its all good, sister

Just keep the sun in my storm clouds
Appreciate you as a man I was born child, young
Looking for young girls to party with
Make your body shift, shake up your cartilage, women
I wasn't satisfied with just one
I'll rip your valentine and having time adjusting, its hard
I thought not a soul could change me
You honor roll, I was down with hoes in grade see, level
I guess there is roses in the ghetto
Gotta find them, always meet the dozen not he diamond, coal
Been supportive now my days shorter
When they was longer dealing with the side effects were calmer, mistakes
I tripped over in my early days
Making the skies over few look a pearly gray, dirty
Until you came along and laid it on
I'll stick with you even if my man say its wrong, for real

[Chorus: x4]

[Baatin]
Since its my last joint I guess I gotta put it down
For the queens who fiend for the kings who come around
I want to extend the jewels to the crown
Behold you are soul that is lost never found
Still a virgin cause you untouched
Fucking around with low-life niggas, getting fucked
You need a king to put it down right
I know you want something that's more than just a one night
Stand tall never fall for the less queen
Naive niggas with tired ass raps stuck in his dream state
With his truck and his real estate, fell for the bait
Not knowing he's trying to change what's sealed in his fate
Just a mouse looking through a crack
Of the gates to a soul never coming back
Cultivators never laid to realize self
And when its done the queen of queens will complete your wealth

And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back
But don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap
Chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater
In the door by the side
Throw you in the trunk and found a preacher for you
Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Ya parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin normal and
I heard you on medication
Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low

Thinkin' to myself the lord must've blessed me many times

Got me on some long term thinkin' other than.

Spending tour money on you girl I don't mind.
But it's been a minute girl, you been on my mind.

Stabbin' each other in the heart through the back
And actin' like the cuts just don't sting me neither
See the sun but the clouds make it smoky
You was my down chick when others just went down on me
Must've saw something in me to wanna birth my first
You changed my mind about raising a child on a earth that's cursed
Wonder where we went wrong when the thing's so right
When our future looked brighter than casino lights lit on the strip
In the bed you shocked me, bit on your lip
Sex was tighter than a leather outfit on a gimp
Was our feelins supposed to disappear the minute we kept, lost
Started out on a good foot then we eventually stepped off
Or is it just troubles that couples go through?
Mad on the phone can't hang up
But I'm hung up on you
Give me a call

Are we in love?
Is it possible to have love within this relationship?
Cause now that I got the time
You should call me tonight
And I'll be alright oohh

I might be forced to leave game alone

No captain save her, my moor dawdle goings
The genie in a bottle, lucky sevens that hit the solid coins
That's all I was, tipping my frame, had a different dip or a dame
Trip over game till they fall in love, had pretty women kiss the ring

Pecking the kicks, bet I'm convinced
I'm everything they wished and dreamed
You was more than just a fish on string
Earned a crown that was fit for queens, you a fix for feens

Know what I mean? Got a dude sick to spleen
Type a girl that could pose for king
(Listen, listen)
You got a body let me pick your brain
Get with dude, get this fame
Ditch your man, shake that lame

Come and take exotic trips
And exclusive whips with the premium bang
Hitting the autobahn, got us shifting lanes
Swear to God, just keep doing your thing
Just

Keep on

Got me in love with you, I'm telling me
All the things you can do for me
To bring my change when you buy my money
I cop the range and now you ride with me

You doing things that make me wanna keep the range
Parked outside when the sun's high
And I love the range but I can't lie

Than I've ever been with any other woman

Might see this pimping change if you keep on

You got me from them things you do
Baby, when you do what you do, when you put it on me
You've got me finding myself going crazy

Entice the moment of innocence
This how we came together
For better bon suited on how to break hearts
Separated then secluded 
Desire was a overwhelming conclusion
Those things of passion created a guard for the delusion 
It makes sense
In a mutual choice the muse 
And states of simple bliss forever we still here 
And in a intense climax the moment a miss 
And the moment of passion is intense enough to commence 
At last we in the depths of orgasm
The experience brought us this far
Now we out fast 
Take the time when expand emotions recommence to the intense
The second is innocence 
Guess the time when expand emotions to the 8 tenths 
A second of innocence, innocence

Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill

To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?

And guess what it lead to

Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart

Without giving up

How do I know

I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear

Sly & Robbie,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

Don't fall in love",Copacabana (At the Copa),1999

You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
You said I've always been a dreamer
`Cos dreaming is all I've ever done
Just like our summer, I thought it would last forever
But as the autumn came, you had gone away
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I`m all all one in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you
Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you've left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
You said I was a born loser
`Cos losing is all I've ever done
Like when I lost you, it proved that all you said was true
And now without you I feel I`m being used
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I`m all all one in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you my Rosalita
All there is left is a photograph
You smile and the ice cream`s meltin` down your pants
And I keep living on, you`re in the past, it`s been so long
Since the Ice Cream Summer, it`s forgotten now it`s gone
Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you've left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
Now you`re just a memory, don`t mean nothing more to me
A photo among others of my old friends and my lovers
And the winter is gone, a new summer`s coming on

La mente non può sapere quello che il cuore sa 
L'orecchio non può sentire quello che il cuore sente 
Le mani non sanno dare quello che il cuore da 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arriuvo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
Il lupo perde il pelo io perdo le occasioni 
Ma non so perdere il vizio delle emozioni 

La vita è più interessante delle definizioni 
E tutto quello che arriva da qualche parte va 
Gerusalemme è divisa sotto ad un solo cielo 
E la mia mente è divisa dentro ad un corpo solo 
Un meridiano per forza incrocia un parallelo 
Determinando la sorte di molta umanità 
E tutto quello che sappiamo non è vero 
E tutto quello che sappiamo non è vero 
Si perdono le origini nel buco del tempo 
Ma tutto si conserva nelle profondità 

Sia l'elefante che il topo non avranno scampo 
La legge della savana li governerà 
Non si può scegliere un sogno non si può scegliere 
Quando ti arriva ti arriva non c'è niente da fare 
Le previsioni del tempo si posson prevedere 
Ma un temporale che arriva non lo puoi fermare 
Si danza per invocare la fertilità 
Si danza prima del sesso o di un combattimento 
Si danza per riscaldarsi dal freddo che fa 
Si danza per imitare il lavoro del vento 

Quando non so dove sono io mi sento a casa 
Quando non so con chi sono mi sento in compagnia 
Quando c'è troppa virtù il cuore mi si intasa 
La cura è spesso nascosta dentro alla malattia 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
Quando tu hai fame nessuno può mangiare per te 
Quando io ho sete nessuno può bere al posto mio 

Anche gli automi hanno un cuore di alluminio puro 
Pronto per farci passare l'amore del futuro 
Abramo lascia la casa senza sapere niente 
Si mette in strada lasciando quel che sapeva già 
E il trapezista si gioca tutto continuamente 
Per pochi soldi ed per un brivido di libertà 
L'autista di scuolabus ha in mano la nazione 
Più di un ministro di un Papa o di un'autorità 
E c'è una terra di mezzo tra il torto e la ragione 
La maggior parte del mondo la puoi trovare là 

Lavori in corso ci dispiace per l'inconveniente 
Hanno scoperto una casa dell'antichità 
Due scheletri abbracciati qualche osso poco o niente 
Ma il loro bacio va avanti per l'eternità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
L'antico impero cinese accolse Marco Polo 
Perchè era un giovane mercante di immaginazione 

Non servono grandi ali per spiccare il volo 
La vita è molto più vasta di una definizione 
E stanno tutti aspettando che succeda qualcosa 
Che tolga il velo di polvere dalla realtà 
E stanno tutti aspettando che arrivi la sposa 
Coi fiori in mano e una promessa di felicità 
Problemi di digestione ispirano romanzi 
Rivelazioni che nascono nell'acidità 
Un pò di bicarbonato dopo certi pranzi 

Si eviterebbe lo scontro delle civiltà 
Gli uccelli volano bassi e sfiorano l'asfalto 
E I cani stanno in silenzio con aria d'attesa 
La foto sulla parete mi segue con lo sguardo 
Nessun allarme per ora nessuna sorpresa 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
E l'invincibile non è quello che vince sempre 

Ma quello che anche se perde non è vinto mai 
L'intelligenza è nel corpo il sapere nel cuore 
Se pensi sempre ad un muro un muro troverai 
Mi son trovato memorie che non sono mie 
Ho un solo nome ma almeno cento identità 
E' naturale preferire le belle bugie 
Alla durezza di ghiaccio di certe verità 

Viviamo comodi dentro alle nostre virgolette 
Ma il mondo è molto più grande più grande di così 
Se uno ha imparato a contare fino a sette 
Vuol mica dire che l'otto non possa esserci 
Senti l'elettricità senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed

I'm so lonely, couples only tonight
You build me up so high, then let me down
It happens every time that he's in town
To know that you're with him just breaks my heart
And that sign above the door keeps us apart",Couples Only,1988
Sly & Sal,"Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning
Donna on my mind the whole day through
Love can't come so quick and real without any warning
Wonder if she's thinking of me too
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me
Even though this thing called love was just fantasy
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine
'Til then I'll just have Donna on my mind
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me",Donna on My Mind,1988
Sly & Sal,"You bring me happiness and leave me loneliness
My world is in distress cause I'm falling for you
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies
You're a heartbreak in disguise and I'm falling for you
Oh darling when you're near my world is happy dear
But when you disappear I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me
It's all a mystery why I'm falling for you
Oh darling when you're near",Falling for You,1988
Sly & Sal,"I called you on the phone to say I love you
And that I'd stop by for you at nine
And my heart broke when you said it's all over
That someone else would take up all your time

And that's an awful lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime

I went downtown to join the marry makers
And told myself that here's where I belong
I thought that I could get along without you
Until I heard somebody play our song

And that's an awful lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
And that's an awful lot of heartaches for a dime",Heartaches for a Dime,1988
Sly & Sal,"I'll just sit back and watch you leave
It seems you want more that I can give
You don't care how much my heart will grieve
You've got to see how the other half lives
Dim lights and smoke filled crowded bars
Loud music that plays until all hours
My today's and tomorrows I would give
If you'd give up the way the other half lives
Dim lights and smoke
If you'd give up the way the other half lives",How the Other Half Lives,1988
Sly & Sal,"From the icy cliffs of Iceland, I've traveled over the land
Through the darkness of Greenland to the islands of Japan
I've met with many people, all kinds of them you see
But I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free

I've seen the hot Pacific, the ocean wide and deep
I've been in old Korea with its mud up to my knees
I've walked the streets of China, seen all there is to see
But I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free

I've sailed the wide Atlantic to France and Germany
The beauty there in Paris just didn't mean a thing to me
I made my way to England and on to Italy
'Cause I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free

And Iceland have its icy cliffs and forty-five below
And Greenland keep its darkness and the freezin' winds that blow
Don't put me off in China or Korea's muddy land
Let Paris keep her beauty and the islands of Japan

I don't want Germany or France or Italy
I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free
I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free",I'd Rather Have America,1988
Sly & Sal,"If you see my baby while making your rounds
In some crowded nightspot or cafe in town
Tell her I miss her and I'm still around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town

Tell her to call me when she's all alone
Cause I'm always waitin' by my telephone
I'd still worship the ground where she walks around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town
Tell her to call me",If You See My Baby,1988
Sly & Sal,"See her ridin' in that long black limousine
There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
And their fancy cars are such a sight to see
Must be all her rich friends that knew her in the city
Yes they finally brought her home to me

All the papers told of how she lost her life
Bout the party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway and the curve no one had seen
Now she's ridin' in that long black limousine

When she left home she told me that someday she'll be returnin'
And she'd leave in a fancy car for all the town to see
And now everyone is watchin' and I guess at last she found her dream
Cause there she goes she's ridin' in a long black limousine

Through tear dimmed eyes I watched as she ride by
With a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Oh I'll never love another for my heart and all my dreams
Are with her in that long black limousine
See her ridin' in that long black limousine",Long Black Limousine,1988
Sly & Sal,"Go with me to Loversville it's just over kissin' hill
I love you and always will so go with me to Loversville
Well we could be so happy there sweet devotion in the air
All our dreams we could fulfill on promise lane in Loversville

Well there would just be me and you the population will be two
True love bloomin' round our door and soon it will be three or four
Any place is Loversville when two lovers find a thrill

Well there would just be me and you
Now go with me to Loversville now go with me to Loversville",Loversville,1988
Sly & Sal,"Hello darling I'm just passin' through this way
Thought I'd call you up I haven't long to stay
Would you meet me in our same old meetin' place
I promise you that I won't speak of yesterday

Just give me one more memory that's all I ask of you
To see you once again would mean a lot to me
We'll pretend I'm just a friend that you once knew
Please be there and give me one more memory

I respect the choice you've made so long ago
If you're happy now that's all I need to know
I'm not here to cause you any misery
But if I could see you I'd have one more memory

Just give me one more memory",One More Memory,1988
Sly & Sal,"You are the key to my happiness lock out the loneliness
Bring back the joyfulness open up my heart
Show me true love again love me like you did when
Our hearts feel young and then open up my heart
I've been so lost without you that I locked up my heart
But I can't forget about you though we're apart
Just show your love for me how happy we could be
You know you have the key that opens up my heart
You are the key to my happiness
I've been so lost without you",Open up My Heart,1988
