Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
And El Dorados, I'm wakin up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, ath-letes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause

[Chorus]

Canarny yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb - Hideout
I'mma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on yo' zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzerd
Or sober; six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eight-ish I know you'll be there for me
Cause

[Chorus]

Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin off at they mouth
And tellin me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't; you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
In double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
(And we are) the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
(In my mind) The sky is falling ain't no need to panic
(But Oh oh) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Oh oh oh) Compatible created in the attic
(repeat)

I just give her beats, I don't give her bread

Bottles on deck and god dammit, god dammit I'm feelin' myself

Pool in the crib you could land a water plane in it
Slick Rick looking at the mirror
Big Daddy Kane bitch Like Shakira
1.5 custom made car
Me and Will table looking like the bar
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And I don't give a fuck that's my fuckin' problem

And I don't give a fuck that's my whole M.O
I rock the whole globe with no problemo
Been rocking coats since my first demo
And now I'm banging hoes in the continental
And I done seen me slidin' out my dope ride
I open up the doors, suicide
I came from the bottom, the sewer side
I made it to the top 'Cause I do it fly
Feelin' fuckin' lucky like the fuckin' Irish
I see the whole game from my third Iris
I tour the whole word like a dirty pirate
To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus

Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' molly
Up in the club, is where you can find me
I do it real big never do it tiny
If you about that bullshit please don't remind me
I step in this motherfucker just to make it work
I get on the floor just to make that booty twerk
Shake, shake that ass like a, like an expert
Shake, shake that ass like a, like an expert

Doobie in my hand, Rollie on my wrist
Got a bottle of that thousand dollar champagne in my fist
Women of in your dreams sleep in my bed
So I don't need your brains I need my ass kissed
But all my homies like give me some head
Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red
Takes shots till our chests burn
We got papers, bottles, mollies, all this let's get it started
The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball
The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star
The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know
The bigger the bank that's more hoes, nigga
And I done spent a quarter milli on clothes
Coppin' them old schools and puttin' foreigns on the road
Real talk and if my fuel get low
I roll up another joint take a shot and reload, pow

DJ Mustard,"When I be in the shower, she know that I leave it alone
So for at least a half an hour, she be tryna break into my phone, oh
I don't know what I did to make her feel insecure
But she gon' have to trust me, cause I ain't even doing no wrong

She won't ever get them four digits
No she won't ever get them four digits
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She won't ever get them four digits

She so damn nosy, don't know why she be listening to her friends
That's probably why she on me, cause they niggas be cheating on them
She just wanna be up in my photos
She just wanna be up in my videos
She just wanna be up in my emails and my DM's

She won't ever get them four digits
No she won't ever get them four digits
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She won't ever get them four digits

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my code to keep
If I should die before I wake
I hope this girl don't crack my bank
Face down, bring her off

What's crackin' baby, other than my code
Just came off the motherfuckin' road
Already it's another episode
I think shawty undercover on the low
You know I be on the phone talkin' real late to 'em
She be walkin' real late on me, getting straight to 'em
I be like ""okay baby stay calm, it's just Jake from State Farm""
On the real, what you searching for?
The thought upsets you, seeing that I hurt you more
I'm out the game but you know that I gotta keep it player
Every night I say a prayer, she won't ever get the four digits

She won't ever get them four digits
No she won't ever get them four digits

She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone

DJ Mustard,"I got a feelin nigga wit it ? and my money be da root.
Look up at da stars, she like ""Honey where da roof?""
Pull up in a Dawes ?, canaries ? dey go on roof,
Even once had a job pourin tar up on da roof.
Dat boy had it hard, no fasad it's da truth,
So now when I menage and get massaged it's da proof.
Proof's in da pudding and dat bakin soda taken,
Paper dat I'm makin, gotta take dem photos naked.
Listenin to niggas like whistlin dat Wendy Williams,
I flip my middle finga, I'm chillin on twenty million.
Da rumors turn me on I'm masterbatin at da top,
These hoes so excited so dey catchin every drop.
I'm dodgin debacles like pot holes in Jamaica,
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on dem acres.
Martin had a dream, Bob got high,
I still do both but somehow I got by.

Creflo prayed, Mike Vick payed,
Bobby Brown strayed, Whitney lost weight.
Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write,
Dat may why the money lookin funny in the light.
But who really cares? You just throw it in the air,
Celebratin wealth, pourin Mo«t in her hair-
Excuse me, her weeve- the bluest of weed,
Trunk full of white, car smell like bleu cheese.
Dat boy get salad ?, beef bout movements,
BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin foolish.
Shawty sittin low, big thangs poppin,
Tip on da glock from a trip up in Compton.
Shootin at da cops- fuck one time.
I gave her to da block, I fucked one time.
We boys in da hood and nigga you Lil' Trey,
Suppress ya appetite, we takin ya lil' tray.
Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit,
Banned in 1994 but I'm too legit to quit.
1996, kilos was the shit,
But dat were better den roofin dat shit be bad for ya skin.
Niggas was ruthless, lord knows dat I sinned,
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin.
Walked out on a gig and I turned to da streets,
Kept my name low key, I ain't heard from in weeks.
I came up with a strategy to come up mathematically,
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me.
Mothafuck em all, they sweat from my balls,
If I drop anotha album I did dat fo my dawgs.
10 Maybachs, everybody ridin big,
I just sit back like: Look what I did.
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness,
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business.

Smokin on a blunt in my own restaurant,
People lookin from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Kunk,
Reincarnated, spirit of a G.
Beef? I'll make you dinner, take a seat so we could eat.
A Farrakhan aura, paws on the Port,
You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork.
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in dey coil,
I'm laughin at you 'cause, kill you niggas when I'm bored.

We steppin on ya crew til the mothafuckas crushed,
And makin sweet love to every women dat ya lust.
I love to pay her bills, can't wait to pay her rent,
Curtis Jackson baby mama ain't askin for a cent.
Burn the house down, we gotta buy another,
Don't forget the gas can, jealous, stupid muthafucka.
To anotha chapter, paper dat I captured,
Caught up in da rapture of gunshots and laughter.
Homicide is human and nigga you lookin funny,
Women love to stare cause dey know dey see da money.
I open up a mind by openin bank accounts,
Deposit a 100 stacks, break up or take it out.
Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live,
I knew it wouldn't work, but I just like to give.
Used to run da street- young nigga, bare feet,
Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin crab meats.
Ice so right, otha rappers envy,
Dey callin all my jewelers up askin wat he spendin.
Thinkin bout Boss, not thinkin bout dem,
This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send.",Deep,2014

On the corner with niggas running them things in
I was told get the money and bring the team in
And never ever let them hoes get between them
Born a slave, but I die a king, and um
For bad bitches with money, I got a thing and um
I'm feeling like King James when he got his ring
Because I started off with nothing except a dream, nigga
I'm cut from a different cloth
They don't make no more, you niggas soft
The streets killed Lil Snupe, I took a loss
That's why my heart so cold, my shit defrost
Everybody saying that I stunt too much
But they don't know where I came from, I done too much
And my ex chick said I like to fuck too much
So I turned around and told her, ""Bitch you want too much""

We knew the outcome and we still tried it
That South Central state of mind
I'm in the field, logic to be a real rider
We did this shit to the extreme where you ain't feel honest
Now this blood is on your hands and you hope these bills wash it
Sinking deeper in regret but that's the real faucet
See man, go for self that was the real Slauson
But do this win lose or draw that was a real promise
Till death do us what's most important was rep to us
The set schooled us to love and lie and respect shooters
Reflect to it this year I'm dropping my best music
Hope you niggas get rich and then reinvest to it
Wish you niggas success and minus the stress to it
Lot of steps lot of losses and regrets to it

Whatever's left to it flying in a jet to it

We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour and they want to tell you a little story
about where they come from

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

You love to hear the story again and again 
of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me 
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn 
Out
By any place any part of the world
And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
When she's in

The Bridge(scratched) (8X)
Queensbridge

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine
And i'm from

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden, 
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'
It was I the abstract 

And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter

Yo, Phife, you remember that routine 
That we used to make spiffy like mister clean?

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then push it along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

Yo, tip you recall when we used to rock 
Those fly routines on your cousin's block

Um, let me see, damn I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender

You on point Tip? 
All the time Phife
You on point Tip? 
Yeah, all the time Phife

Yo, all the time Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Luke Brock
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while 
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own 
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and 
Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

 Friends

 Friends*

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends
 
When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

*Friends
 How many of us have them?
 Friends

 Friends

 Before we go any further, let's be 
 Friends*
 
You say you and your girlfriend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
 
You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

And now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

Every Beat Of My Heart
Red Hot In Black
I met her in a little French cafe
Legs like a young giraffe
She was sitting reading Baudelaire
Not exactly working class

She had a studio in St. Michel
Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall
She can't stand the sun on her face

Hey boys, what a look
Stop a train at fifty feet
Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Revolution running through her veins
A radical from head to toe
The only record that she ever played
Was ""just like a rolling stone""

We started talking by the candlelight
Her lips get closer to mine
We started dancing all around the room
Helped by a bottle of wine

Hey boys, mystery
Didn't even know her name
One night in Paris, with a girl like that
Never going home again
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Oh my, when I woke up
She'd already gone out to her work
My head was aching and my back was scratched
I've never, never, never known a night like that

Took a walk along the avenue
So in love and so confused
My plane was leaving in half an hour
What would you have done in my shoes?

Hey boys, so you see
Couldn't get her outa my head
My regards to the folks back home
Gonna spend some time with red

DJ Nabs,"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up convert it in a hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
Cause you'll get fried in the end if you pretend to be
Competing cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme wit yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stun
Remember me, the one you got your idea from
But soon you start to suffer but you only get rougher
When you start to stutter that's when you had enough of
Biting it, I make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should of broke cause I ain't no joke

I got a question, it's serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pack then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood chores
The e-m-c-e-e don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those 7 mc's
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat dj, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait til e say
Play 'em, so I'mma have to dis and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke

I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation cause when I invent
I nominated my dj the president
When I'm senile, people freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
They'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiendin'
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the r so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
Cause I'm moving the crowd and b a record fader
No interruptions and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And take you for a walk through hell
Feed your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple state darkness
When it get dark again then I'mma spark this
Microphone cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finish when the beat is gone, I'm no joke",I Ain't No Joke,1998
DJ Nabs,"I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speakin so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessin, 
So listen to the lesson I preach,
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem,
Full of knowledge, from my toes to the top of my dome,
I'm kinda young, but my tongue speaks maturity,
I'm not a child, I don't need nothin for security
I get paid when my record is played, to put it short,
I got it made,

I'm outspoken,
My language is broken into a slang,
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang,
I play it cool, 'cause coolin is all that I'm about
Just foolin wit tha girlies, yes I'm bustin it out,
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use,
I'm creatively superior, yo, I never lose
I never lost 'cause I'm the boss,
I never will 'cause I'm still,
The champion, chief one, won't lose until,
I choose,

Which I won't 'cause I don't retreat,
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street,
You're invitin me, a titan to a battle, why?
I don't need your respect 'cause I,
Got it made,

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted,
Never boosted, never shoplifted,
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin,
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and,
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Ever other week I get a brand new car,
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more,
Kinda fond of honda scooters, got seventy-four
I got the riches, to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies,
Even got a little island of my very own,
I gotta frog, a dog with a solid gold bone,
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent
Got gear out wear, to everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A.
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent,
So it really doesn't matter, how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes, daily
You burn me, really?
Think, just blink and I made, a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked, a million times
Damn I'd be paid,
I got it made,

I'm kinda spoiled,
'Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead, I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me,
I got the army brigade,
I'm not a trader,
If what you got is greater I'll trade,
But maybe later 'cause my waiter made potato n' alligator souflee,
I got it made",I Got It Made,1998
DJ Nabs,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

DJ Nabs,"Ah one two, ah one two
Ah one two, ah one two
I'd like to... introduce myself...
My name is... ah Biz Markie..

Well I'm the human ultra called Biz Markie
Making music orderly is my specialty
When I go, ah one two, girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em
I know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow
And I can play rapping records and all disco
Like ""Beat It,"" ""Billie Jean,"" by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous 3 record, they call ""Action""
When you hear me do it, you will be shocked and amazed
It's the brand new thing they call the human beat box craze

[Chorus]
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
Make the music with your mouth, biz!

Well I don't just do the beat box, I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say, all the people like
I get the crowd jumping, get the girl's hearts pumping
All the party people say, ""Isn't he something?""

Rock from New York City all the way down South
Saying rhymes and making music, with my mouth
I'm a tell you party people how I began
It started when I'm living in Long Island

Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Making sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats
Grown people, used to say - ""what""?
Grown people, used to say - ""what""?
.. wrong with that kid making that strange noise

It was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboys basement party
They thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me
When they came by the DJ, and saw who it is
They said, ""Make the music with your mouth, Biz!""

[Chorus]

It may look and sound easy doing the human beat box
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note

I like doing it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all the props, spitting, breathing hard and doing
You need practice, be ambitious in the schooling

Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doing sounds, that's hard to achieve
Making two or three sounds at one time you can't believe

When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, ""how you make all those sounds at one time Biz Markie?""
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doing it since, fifteen years old

And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm telling you a fact, and just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say, ""What up Biz?""

Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test

I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into hysterics!

[Chorus]


You heard the proceeding, now here's the sequel
All human beat boxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doing my beat in a special way

Making musical tunes, orally, I have perspective
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou...

DJ Naughty,"Like a walking dog shifting by the flow
Easy slider wants to blow in Budapest

This endless feeling follows ghostly
And vicious as a plague you know where we are now?
In Budapest

A chest with no breath creeping through a darkness
An iced game of chess melting in Budapest

Building a gambling house in my head
Near the castle a cold hunter lays
In Budapest

Now, watch out
It's coming on

Tokaj running in my veins
What was soaking is now croaking in Budapest

Sniper holes across partitions of my soul
Street cars tearing up the skies of Budapest

Travestied gods, Transylvanian guns
I do hear and see surely I should run far from Budapest

Cave-accordions, they taste my flesh
And in fast motion, men are mean, mean, mean, mean and mesh
In Budapest

I may have a few contacts but no peace I could find
And the burning synagogues are lighting up all
Of Budapest

Paranoid express through excess and excess
Here I am just a guest who doesn't need to be blessed
In Budapest

Now, watch out
It's coming on

Paranoid express, take a, take a, take a deep breath
I don't wanna be blessed
I don't wanna be blessed

DJ Negro,"Aqui estoy filosofo, asi me dicen
Nunca dejo que los grandes me pisen
Yo soy un maestro en la vida social 
why en mujeres para que contar
Soy una mquina llena de sabiduria
Desde pequeno mi papa lo sabia 
Que yo algun dia iba a comprender 
Que importante yo tenia que ser
Tengo mi propio estilo no seas atrevido
O de mi casa te sacamos prendido
Le ruego a Dios por una vida normal 
Que lo malo en mi mente no se valla a colar
Muchos me quieren why otros no por si famosos
why por mi fama hay cien mil envidiosos
Tratando de hacer lo mismo que hago yo
Pero papa como mi inteligencia no bailo
professor de las artes a veces me llaman
Mi espetaculo siempre me aclaman
Me claman a mi porque soy Vico-see
Le digo no a las drogas why a la vida que si
Soy de la calle sin pena, juy!, no te lo niego
why lo que digo no se trata de un juego
Tanto el sexo como la indiferencia 
los ninos los aprenden por negligencia
Todo lo que yo enseno es complicado 
why mis derechos estan reselvados
Hoy why manana yo subo de reputacion 
Por todo lo que sensena mi cancion
Soy el filosofo

Sabiduria why demas
Soy el filosofo

Yo soy muy joven lo acepto pero se de esto
Siempre que canto me olvido del resto
Soy estudiante de escuela superior
A los maestros demuestro quien es el mejor
Como sin tatica, en matematica
Siempre tengo la mejor estatica
Que me convierte en un sabio mortal
why es dificil que yo me vaya a equivocar
Inteligente soy pa la cumbre voy 
A todos los puertoriquenos mamita le doy
En Venezuela, Miami, New York donde sea
Lo dice el filosofo pa que usted vea
Que no es lo mismo pensar que decir
Cuando hable tu palabra tiene que medir
Si no te apean un tiro no muerete chivo
Pero en un mes te van a dejar vivo
Asi que quidao de lo que estas hablando
Pero esa gente que me esta criticando
Que hoigan que escuchen lo que contea mi cancon
Soy el filosofo no hay discusion
Lo bueno lo malo ventajas defectos
Es el vacuna de aprender que yo injecto
why si lo injecto en toda tu consciencia
Aprendera de religion why de ciensa
Soy una clinica, para que aprenda
Para que el resto de tu vida tu entianda
Soy una clinica creada para ti
Supervisada por Vico-see
Soy el filosofo

Sabiduria why demas
Soy el filosofo

La politica es verdad why es engano
En esta epoca te hare dano
Criminalidad cad cuatro anos
Esos politicos son muy estranos
Ofrecen las cosas why nunca las cumplen
En las elecciones que nadie los culpen
Palabras bien falsa ellos siempre dicen
Nacionalistas siempre los maldicen
Muy mala cosa va en esta era
why la politica es la falla primera
Tengo en mi mente una solucon
Que el F.B.I. investigue la movida de la corruption
?Quien sabes lo que es filosofia?
En realidad escucha la mia
Soy un filosofo sin doctorado
Porque en la calle es que me he graduado
Contribuyendo a la sociedad
why matando las bestias que afecta en la comunidad
Contribuyendo al poder del bien
Protegiendo la madera manuciada por el comegen
La inteligencia o tiene creencia
La supersticion es como una sentencia
Si tu cree que halgo malo va a pasar
Supersticiones no te podran salvar
Actua con mucha sortura
Unete a tu gente why a la gefatura
Asi nivelara tu vida mucho mejor
why por el crimen no sentiras temor
Soy el filosofo

Sabiduria why demas
Soy el filosofo

Las criticas comentaron bien sinicos
Sean de embuste o sean veridico
Son opiniones que la envidia construye
El bochinchero al problema le huye
Despues de que habla por ser envidioso
A todos demuestra que soy un miedoso
La envidia lo hare actuar enganosos
why el demonio seguira con su gozo
why, hoye esto, no voy a permitir
Que me saludes, despues hable de mi
Soy enemigo de toda la hipocrecia
Que esto lo aclare mi filosofia
Cantando why no chismeando
why el problema siempre analizando
Esto es un caso controversial why por eso
Todos nos tenemos que percaptar
la competencia ese jueguito termino
Pues el mejor representante de la calle soy yo
Soy el maestro, memoriza bine
Cuando yo termino todos gritaran amen
Te di consejos gratuitos
No tuviste que pagar
Ese no es na a mi me gusta hablar
Conversar why arreglar problemas que afeta la gente
why tengan esto bien presente 
Luis armando es mi numbre, me dicen Vico-see
why a mis alumnos ya yo los convenci
Con mi conversacon why personalidad
Contra la gente corrupta llena de maldad

Pues he prometido que venia a verte aunque estubiera fligido
Cogiste el camino de la separacion
why tu no sabes como eso afecta mi corazon
Dios mio ayudame, why nunca permita
Que mi alma se destroce con esta visita
Mi mujer no me escucha, estando ahi acostada
No me mira no me abraza no me dice nada
Culpa tengo yo por no cumplir con mis promesas
Haciendote pasar muchos dias de tristeza
Por que no me di cuenta que yo actuaba muy mal
Ahora el remordimiento me quiere matar
Hombre al fin donde quiera que me paro
Las lenguas me persiguen cuando formo mi relajo
why asi sucesivamente pude perder
La gente habla sin parar sin tan siquiera saber
Pero ya es tarde
Ya escogiste tu decision, me abandonaste why asi cumpliste con tu mision
Pero yo lucho para que unque sea pueda sentir
why se muy bien que es imposible pero voy a seguir
Mi sentimientos hoy, se inclinan a tu vida
Manana buscare un camino a la salida, pues
Esto me encierra en un circulo vicioso 
Que me aparta de lo que pudo ser tan hermoso

Coro (2X):
Me acuerdo cuando te entregaste a mi
Me acuerdo como me aferraba yo a ti
Me acuerdo los dos sonando en una noche de pasion
No me escuchas, no me miras, se remuelde mi corazon

Te noto bien palida 
No eres la misma
Te falta la sonrisa que dibuja tu carisma
Te siento muy fria tus labios resecos
Hinutil te ves, why sin faltarte al respecto pero
Eso no importa te amo como eres
why nunca sentire lo mismo con otras mujeres
Dios me creo para quererte a ti
Yo maldigo el momento en que te perdi
why esta perdida es indudablemente eterna
Quisiera inventarme una luz moderna
Que alumbrara el camino de la felicidad
Porque sinseramente no acepto la realidad
Un ser humano no es capaz de aguantar este peso
Yo sufro me remueldo why lloro en exeso
Si crees que exagero pues lo hago por ti
Porque demuestro lo que tu significas para mi

Coro (2X)

Me acuerdo de la brisa que nos acarisiaba
Pues el viento a nuestra relacion apreciaba
Tu pecho junto al mio el calor provocaba
why asi por el estilo nuesras almas se entregaban
Me acuerdo de la noche en que tu me conocistes
Todas las caricias agradables que me hicistes
Me acuerdo de todas las palabras que digistes
Diciendome en secreto que el amor si existe
Pero con el tiempo el libreto cambio
Pues la malicia como siempre pasa se involucro
why yo un ser humano como los demas seres
Adopte el punto debil del hombre, mujeres
Ya en ese tiempo no pensaba muy bien 
De la pasion por exeso parecia un reen
Te ahogabas en tus lagrimas why en tus sufrimientos
Yo no se lo que pasaba con mi sentimientos
Luego escuche a todo el mundo decir
Que por mi la vida te ibas a destuir
Yo no crei en tus palabras te ignore como a un perro
why mirate ahora manana es tu entierro
Metida en esa caja sin poderte mover
Todos te lloran why me culpan sin poder comprender
Que fue un error no tina los ojos bien abiertos
Mi amor perdoname aunque hayas muerto

Tenia un carro del ano ropa moderna why en su cuello un cadenon
Me presento sus amitadas profesionales de alta posicion
why yo solo aparentaba tener dinero para formar mas union
Conoci una muchacha de ojos azules why cuerpo fenomenal
Dije que era el hijo de un doctor para poderle interesar
La invite a salir why me miro de arriba a abajo hasta que quizo aceptar
why no sabia que estaba formando parte del mundo artificial

Mundo artificial

Al llegar a mi casa me puse la mejor ropa que tenia
Era la cita mas cara de mi vida asi que vacie mi alcancia
Cogi el carro de mi tio prestado why sin decir hacia donde iba
Conduci a la casa de la chica why era un palacio desde abajo hasta arriba
Toque la puerta, abrio el papa why pregunto, ""?Tines Dinero?""
why yo le dije usted despreocupese que eso para mi es lo primero
Me invito a pasar me invito a senar pero para ser bien sincero
Me sntia como un simple guzano en el medio de un gallinero
Por fin salimos, fuimos al cine why gozamos sin descanzar
Todo lo que ella tocara con la vista yo lo tenia que comprar
Pero, que importa, nos hicimos novios why nos fuimos a celebrar
why mi mente no comprendia que ella estaba en el mundo artificial

Mundo artificial
Mundo de fantasia

Mi situacion economica empeoro de la noche al amanecer
En esos dias tuve que trabajar duro hasta mas no poder
why todo ese lo hacia para que mis panas ricos pudieran ver
Que a cualquier senorita de cualquier posicion la podia complacer
Su supuesto amor que sentia por mi la hizo pensar en la boda
why yo me dije a mi mismo ""Dios mio pero quien me salva ahora""
why solamente para que todos me dijeran ""Vico-see el casanova""
Decidi complacerla why convertirla para siempre en mi senora
Conclui en que mi pobreza ya no la tenia que negar
Ella decia juraba why aseguraba que siempre me iba a adorar
La lleve a mi casa para que se pudiera familiarizar
why ahi comenzo la tragedia hecha por el mundo artificial

Mundo artificial

Al mirar los humildes muebles que adornaban mi apartamento
Se mostro extranada why se fue, sin tan siquiera tomar asiento
why yo, que no comprendia lo que pasaba en esos momentos
Decidi perseguirla, pero mis pasos fueron demasiado lentos
Me llamo why me confeso que fue una gran desilucion
why yo afectado le dije que queria una simple explicacion
Me dijo que habiamos terminado sin la minima compasion
why colgo el telefono, why esa fue su ultima decision
Decidi salir a buscarla pues yo no podia aceptar
Que me dejara asi porque si con todas mis dudas sin aclarar
Al llegar a su casa mis lagrimas se empezaron a derramar
Cuando la vi con amigo el rico
Asi es el mundo artificial

DJ Negro,"El nino Antonio Perez, asi su madre lo nombro
En el medio del bajo mundo humildemente se crio
Sudando, buscando el pan, compitiendo con la miseria
Su pobreza era seria, pero luchaba con mucho afan
Queria ser arquitecto why los estudios su padre pago
Pero al crecer su ambicion era enorme why el crimen escogio

Las seis de la tarde esta oscureciendo 
La venta va bien why el dinero creciendo
Mucha precaucion velando la jara
El joven Antonio Perez se prepara
Tony, asi le dicen a Antonio
El tiempo lo ha convertido en demonio
Su biblia un 357, su ofio *disparo* why cobrar un billete
La palabra paz el no la entiende
Es un asesino why de eso depende su casa su ropa su alimento 
Quitando vidas en cualquier momento
Seis de la manana, tocan la puerta 
Es el jefe why Tony se despierta
Le dan un retrato why una direccion
Prepara su revolver why empieza la accion

Tony llega al sitio indicado
Vigila a la victima que esta al otro lado
Cruzando la calle frente a el se para
why sin pena le pone un magnum en la cara
El cuerpo cae con un count de dinero
Tony lo recoge why se lo lleva ligero
El hombre en el piso mucha sangre derrama 
El denero robado se invierte en marijuana
Tony sigue con su cruel mision
Es uno de los grandes en la asociacion
El corrupto esconde su identidad
Es el sal de la droga rey de la maldad
Las tres de la manana, Tony dormino 
Los guradias tumban la puerta con mucho ruido
Tony pregunta ""pero yo!, que paso""
""Es una orden de arresto asi que shut up""
Llega el otro dia compran el vocero
El pueblo lee lo de Tony primero
Sale culpable con to why poder 
why su familia sufriendo why llorando por el 

Pasa un ano why dos o tres meses
Tony en el banco pierde intereses
Su nombre nuevo para el es un fastidio
Ahora le dicen, Tony Presidio
Controla los guardias corruptos que venden
Los que obedecen, pero pretenden 
Romper la ley vendiendo esa cosa que llaman quimica extra-peligrosa
Asi es que la addicion prosigue en los presos
why Tony Presidio se aprovecha de eso 
Pues el es el grande el distribudor 
El que vende el polvito que le cura el dolor
Pero Tony quiere rehabilitarse
Planea una fuga why logra escaparse
Es un fugitivo que quiere lo mejor para su vida
Asi que se largo a New York
Pero las cosas alla no le van muy bien
El taxi es muy caro why no le gusta el tren
El clima es muy frio
La cosa no es la misma
Asi que prefiere progresar en su isla
Llega el avion, Tony Presidio se asoma
Pisa su tierra sin duda se emociona
Llega a su barrio saludando a su gente
cuando siente un disparo que se cuela en su vientre

El hombre Antonio Perez en el regreso a su hogar
Queria rehabilitarse why una nueva vida comenzar
Cuando de momento siente un valazo en su cuerpo
Callendo ya casi muerto se fijo rapidamente
Un hombre que por venganza lo siguio sin descanzar 
Pues Tony le habia quitado la vida a un familiar
Que pena que el bajo mundo
Prosiga con este fastidio
Quye pena que muchos muerean

DJ Netik,"We're going to begin to act
Beginning, today
To do whatever needs to be done
Let's get on with the job!

World has turned over many times
And it transformed the history of men
In the will or the skill to fight
We're ready to take part
But now further direction is required
Tonight a battle has been join
We will not fail
Regrettably, we know believe that only force will make them live.

I just wanna say this right now
That regardless of what they say about it
There's nothing new, only different!
Never forget this, the future is to those who take it
All I say is that noting is easy, and the best things are the hardest.

That isn't enough, it is madness!

Some men see things as they are and say why?
I dream things that never were and say why not.

Epic battle has ended,
Thank you, good night and farewell.",Le Banquet,2012

Surpass bliss with the pain so strange it fascinates/
Go rabid as the savage engage you need to vaccinate/
pack a razor blade in my skin slash it to make you grin/
stuff a slut full of my nut just to break her in/
It pays to sin motherfucker you gotta play to win/
They're hating him Forsaken the worst and I've disgraced my kin/
Fuck it though your face where my fucking knuckles go/
So pucker up this ain't no sucker punch its my fucking show/
I punish foes with blows and flows that eat the soul/

The hatred and racism and placed it across nations/
Embracing the heartbreak as I'm breaking the foundation/
Aroused by bloodshed its he sound and these frowned faces/
I wish your spirit to fry like a pound of bacon/
I've questioned their every move like they're building around masons/
Now they're about facing I'm never about patience/
They should've been out so now their flesh I'm about tasting/

clenching my teeth  none as evil as Im destined to be/

And lava so warm and red and wet! 
Mountain is rumbling, must find a safer place, 
Soon the wrath of Pele, will fall upon your face. 
Great nectar of the gods, spews rock from Pinutabo, 
Mixed with a woman's sweat, makes the lava we know. 
Oh, baby, every time that we kiss, hot lava! 
And every time that we make love, that's lava, hot lava! 
It's lava so hot it makes me sweat, 
And lava so warm and red and wet! 
Burning through the forest, where red hot lava flow, 
Rolls down the island's body, and into the ocean below! 
When it meets the cool cool water, here's your main sludge of living rich 
Magma flowing into a subaqueous environment produces pillar lava 
Hydrostatic pressure of sea water tends to inhibit the vesicle size of the basalt! 
Oh, baby, every time that we kiss, hot lava! 
And every time that we make love, that's lava, hot lava! 
It's lava so hot it makes me sweat, 
And lava so warm and red and wet! 
And after the eruption, 
You lay dormant for a while.. 
Let's just hold each other and talk. 
For now, Pele sleeps..

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

It wouldn't even be a midwest without Bone Thugs
Try to knock me off my square, nigga I won't budge
Born from broke, I speak in a street for coins
I keep heat in a jeep, you can't beat Detroit
Try that strong arm shit and you get buried alive
All y'all niggas is big, but none y'all is ready to die
It's a freak mind game we play when we smart
You say it's a art, blame nothin' you say in your heart
It's a sixth sense that real niggas got
Yo, we know, just know, if you a hoe, or not
If I could filter out the game, I would
I'll speak niggas name, I'ma bet they got the same opinions about me

Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Ohhh

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh

DJ Ötzi,"Ein falsches Wort, ein Augenblick
Ein schlechter Witz und kein zurück
Hab so viele Fehler gemacht
Doch du hast nichts gesagt.
Nicht zugehört, mich übersehen
Wollt deine Sorgen nicht versteh´n
Dabei war mir doch klar
Du bist immer für mich da.

Doch wenn ich seh´ wie es dir geht
Und wie traurig du jetzt bist
Dann fang ich an zu versteh´n
Was allein mir wichtig ist.

Denn dich weinen sehen, sollte wirklich nicht geschehen
Nur Freudentränen sollten die Wangen runtergehen,
Ich schenk' dir mein Leben, kann ich noch was für dich tun
Zusammen wird alles wieder gut.

Ich hab gedacht da gab es mehr
Von allem mehr es fällt oft schwer
Das wahre Glück auch zu sehen auch wenn´s direkt vor einem steht
So fragst du mich wie konnt' das passieren
Mir fehl´n die Worte dir zu erklären
Doch dann nehm' ich dein Hand
Und ich sprech' dich endlich an.

Wenn ich nun seh´ wie es dir geht
Und wie traurig du jetzt bist,
Dann fang ich an zu versteh´n
Was allein mir wichtig ist

Denn dich weinen sehen, sollte wirklich nicht geschehen
Nur Freudentränen sollten die Wangen runtergehen,
Ich schenk' dir mein Leben, kann ich noch was für dich tun
Zusammen wird alles wieder gut.

Hab ich auch Angst dich aus Sorge zu verlieren
Schau ich dich an und spreche leise zu dir.

Ich hab getanzt, gelacht und auch geweint, in meinem Elfenwunder Land.
Nicht einen Atemzug bereut.
Komm der Sonne viel zu nah und wünsche mir, dass es Liebe war.

Einmal Himmel und zurück. Abenteuer und Traum vom Glück.
Wieviel Träume bleiben ungeträumt?
Schieb' das Leben nicht mehr auf, bau' den Drachen und steig hinauf.
Es kommt kein Augenblick jemals zurück.

Halt still mein Herz, noch siehst du die Sterne nicht,
Doch ein Zauber hüllt dich ein, wie ein zärtliches Gedicht.
Vertrau dem Wind, denn er kennt den Weg bestimmt.
Große Träume sterben nicht, auch wenn das Glück zerbrechlich ist.
Ganz egal was auch geschah, ich wünsch mir, dass es Liebe war.

Dann gehst du hindurch und dann stirbst du dafür

Se que eres chico y quiero que empieces a entender 
No quiero que juegues jamás con mi guitarra 
Es juego de manos que después te llega al alma 
Yo la abrace mas tiempo a ella de lo que abrace a tu madre 
Es por eso que te pido no trates de acostumbrarte 

Te dolerá el corazón
Cuando quieras desahogarte con ella en una canción 
Por la que quiso engañarte

Sentirás que es tu mejor compañera 
En un momento de tristeza 
Con ella te desahogaras
Y nunca trates de olvidar algún amor con una copa 
Porque mas la recordaras 

Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
(Y nunca, nunca trates de ser como yo, te aconsejo por que te quiero 
es por eso es que te digo hijo escúchame) 

Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
Voy enseñarte a respetar a una mujer 
Si algún día te enamoras y ella tiene un feo pasado 
Solo tienes que preocuparte como se porte a tu lado 

Trata de nunca fijarte en mujeres que no están solas 
Yo sé que eso tiene un gustito tentador, pero hay otras

Algunas buscan amar 
Otras buscan aventuras 
Y muchas miraran solamente tu postura 
Serás seguramente un buen amante 
Ninguna podrá atraparte 
De esas que quieren lastimar

Serás un hombre echo y derecho 
pero para mí siempre serás

Too many rappers ain't droppin no jewels!
Too much negativity, in the things we say

Too many young black soldiers, in too many graves
Too many of us still thinkin like slaves!

My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason

Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed,2006

And a henn from a smile
Bucket side blood cooking
Got a problem wit' my style
Wit' the click, wit' the clan
Lanes I don't understand
If you feel that you real
Fuck it's on lightning steel
On the real hoes but they mouth
And get pimp smacked
Automatic gat, get yo' motherfuckin' head crack
Heat tight, trick tight
Killas pullin' pistol plates

Nothing hoe but the dick
Got me bent out of shape
To you hoes that are fake
Get the fuck out my face
Before I shoot you in ya face
Murder rate, shell increase

And I'm bringing this paper faster than
These other lil bastards can
So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay
Like a bitch weigh
And then a bitch stay
Wouldn't sit still
Fuck how this shit feel
This ain't studio pimping
This shit real pimping

To many niggas out here buying hoes a meal
Nigga that ain't the way a bitch supposed to feel

Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt hoe
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser

Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown
Niggaz with them gold teeth
Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover
Make your baby mama love us
Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash

Always got to watch your friends
Backstabbers cause a snitch

Now see let me blow your mind the real business in the wind
The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggaz pimping hoes
Take a look around now it be hoes pimping hoes
What the business what the deal man these hoes got me fucked
Make me walk up in the strip and kind of get like buck
Oh you fucking with my cheese oh you fucking with my paper
Bitch you got to pay the piper even if you straight rape her
I ain't mad about my girl licking pussy with a girl
Cause she got to get it done but that thing ain't my world
Bitch I'll tell you what your job and your job nonstop
I need the spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch
I need the coke keys, door keys, low keys, rover keys
On knees and Bentley's, mozzarella cheese

Come back to love.

Can you see it all that everything we were turned into dust.
Do you believe it? Can we ever get back to us? (Us baby)

Memories in the breeze are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right but I'm wrong now.
So many feelings, I miss you just a little too much

We built it all, then let it all crash down.
We had it all, then let it burn to the ground.
But maybe we turn around and get back

DJ Polo,"He's the big boss when his hands criss cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJs relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

DJs he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm cool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle cool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Cool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral
Contact, and at the maximum, yo he's climax

He's a record spinner winner, that you can bet 

Eats DJ's for dinner on his table set 
With cuts he concocts and the party rocks 
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box 
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer 

One hundred percent excellent entertainer 
The mker and creator of the lyrical line 
Idea of Shakespeare, the mind of Einstein 
Surrender, pretender, you don't exist 

As a vocalist, so you can kiss this 
I'm cool G Rap, greatest of all times 
And you can see it, inside my rhymes 
See it's a demo 
[Repeat: x4] 

My recital will form a musical brainstorm 
Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn 
The performer recites, competitors ignite 
Audiences tonight I came to incite 

Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult 
Equivalent to a thousand volts 
To my brief rap speech you attach like a leech 
Examine when I'm jamming and when I preach 

Before I'm completed, you will all be deleted 
You said I sucked, instead I succeeded 
Fan fascinator, I supply data 
According to the groove, I'm a real smooth operator 

I activate a musical device 
Dialogues are concise, no need to splice 
My system contains musical rap rain 
Instrumentals inserted inside your brain 

All levels rate low with a medium tempo 
I give a dramatical cameo show 
And now you know DJ Polo 
These party people are ready to go 
See it's a demo 
[Repeat: x4]

Better than a Snicker when it comes to a snack 
I go solo with Polo when I'm in combat 
I'm the MC humanoid and I just get annoyed 
Boy you'll be destroyed cause you copy like a Polaroid 

Coming like a meteor inside any area 
Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier 
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize 
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise 

The microphone fanatic, cause I'm the Asiatic 
Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatic 
Ly suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate 
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate 

Mutilate at a rate to penetrate you 
No other crew can rescue 
My talents are balanced my audience is silent 
MC's stop biting or I'll get violent 

It's a demo... 
[Repeat: x4] 

Take a scene to the extreme 
To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream 
So don't even quote what you write is dolt 
Your rhymes are small-time through a microscope 

More cooler than an Ice Ages 
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages 
Different stages of rage that I'm going through 
And like an owl, you'll know who to 

Feed your greed, you want and need 
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed 
'Cause my fury is scary 
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy 
 
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing 
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying 
Then I release steam like a radiator 
And attack MC's like a gladiator 

As my talent proceeds to grow, yo 
This ain't the end of the show, it's a demo

DJ Polo,"Deadly rhymes, here's the solution
Smoking so bad, I'mma cause a pollution
With satisfaction, bad assassin, fatal attraction
Drop you to an improper fraction
Ill insanity, kill like Amity-
Ville horror, as I wipe out humanity
Won't leave a path, a track, a trail to trace
But when you're staring inside a mirror, you see my face
And I'll terrify, so don't ever try
To shake or bake or flake cause I never fry
Letters together sly as a fox clever than ever
Silly ducks write rhymes with feathers
Really no needles are needed to inject this
Dope cause I'm a death wish, not even Bob Hope's
Rhymes are rugged, soul flooded, cold blooded
You ain't better, you're butter, so just shut it
Here to perform, having a brainstorm, make a rain form
Hot rap groups run to keep the name warm
Putting heads to beddy-bye like Freddy so get ready
Cause I'mma get crazier than Crazy Eddie
I'm alone but my tone is a sharp tune
Developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom
Rappers are captured and tortured with rapture
In 3-D is a G coming at you
Words in my rap will surprise you like Cracker Jacks
You dig them like Sugar Smacks and bite them like Apple Jacks
Brother, sister, misses or mister
My style is complicated, patterns like a twister
FOES, my shadow grows when I walk slow
Nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low
But I've been urging to drill in your brain like a surgeon
Rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin
More competitors change to challenger
You need to talk into a mic with a silencer
My defeat is like a mission impossible
My brain is unexplained, not illogical
Therefore I'm passing bait to assassinate
Busting your ass so fast, it'll fascinate
You try to duplicate to get up to date
Can't wait to be my pen pal or paper mate
The innovator with greater data, deeper than a crater
Of course, Polo's the boss of the crossfader
The rage is on, my rhymes are airborne
Stage is torn to wreck, my murdering gear's on
Moving a head, never bled inside a bloodshed
Nothing is said, instead heads are dead
G Rap manages styles, taking all the advantages
Putting sucker rappers in bandages
I got a plot so hot it'll tan
I might be cool but I'm far from a fan
Letting you know how it is in show biz
Give me a quiz and I'mma a show you a G wiz
Bright as Einstein, brighter than sunshine
Rhymes will intoxicate like moonshine
Total disaster the broadcaster master
Passed ya as the tempo goes faster
Sparks shoot out from the mic when I rhyme ignites
All types of words I write, put in flight
Rappers evaporate to vapor
I drop science on paper and then build a skyscraper
When I die, scientists will preserve my brain
Donate it to science to answer the unexplained
But as long as I inhale and exhale
I challenge the next female or the next male
What you hear in your ears all appears to be clear
Consider me fair cause I share ideas
That sticks to the mix, more tricks than a 666
So you better grab a crucifix

Men at work

My ideas overload
And the records I make explode in every zip code
Definitely def, the five fingers of death
Doc the Butcher, Polo's the chef
And I'm the waiter cause I serve imitators
Who try to duplicate like an emulator
Try to get paid copying a name brand
If I was Gucci, then you would be Dapper Dan
Now hear the diaper, cause I'm a sniper
You want to get hyper?
Prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass
And fall in place, just keep up the pace no time to waste
Just enter the place to see the entertainer
My rhymes keep me fresh like a container
Some rappers said, my rap is dead
Shake your head to my bass like a basehead
There'll be bloodshed in the meat shop
Those who beef get sliced into pork chops
Until your fork stops stabbing my rhymes
From the latest and the greatest of all times
Sleep while you knock Z's, I'mma clock G's
Freeze rap heroes below zero degrees
Rhymes like these will seize enemies
That want to be G, like the Bee Gees
Not rated PG, we break necks
Like sex, rated XXX
Yes, Doc Da Butcher is who I recommend
DJ Polo let the record spin

Construction put on paper
Listen cause I'm building a skyscraper
For a strong foundation of wheels of steel
Not a reel to reel, but the real deal
Polo works the crossfader, he's a bricklayer
And the record player turns like the Himalaya
Doc the Butcher supplies the cement
And the rhymes that I invent is the blueprint
While I'm using my mind to make a design
Polo puts up the Men at Work sign
Yeah, we still building, making a skeleton
One of the sucker MC's just fell again
So take caution if you want to know the truth
I'mma elevate you up to the roof
Listen to the sound, don't dare look down
Cause you're far from the ground
Now you're impressed cause words I manifest
Takes you more higher than cess or Buddha bless
Hard as concrete, the building's complete
Yo Marley Marl, let's stop the breakbeat",Men at Work,1989

Back again 
What? 
This is poison so be alert and cautious 

Those who act courageous you will get nauseous 
Infected or contaminated 
Turn on your stereo never come radio activated 
Deadly and fatal poison the title 

My recital hits the parts that are vital 
So tune in the tone of beats and poems 
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones 
Pull out your Q tips clean out the earwax 

If you're still hard of hearing, I'mma scrub them with Ajax 
With maximum drum so behave and remember 
You're a slave to my sound wave 
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find 

A new method time after time 
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen 
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then 
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper 

Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper 
Like cherries or some say berries 
Mandatory for the auditory and its glory 
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me 

G speaks in a new technique of fury 
Domination of drums and noise and 
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison 

Poison! [Repeat: x3] 
Look-alikes on the mic you should get off 
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get rid of, cause you bit off 
Bite off ate off imitate off 
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off 
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup 
Male or female shut them up, Po shut her up 
 
Yeah hide my line as you pick them up 
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as well have said stick them up 
Letters of metaphor matters to better the fatter your pocket 
Rhymes blast off like rockets 

Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased 
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass 
Made in a minute the sky is the limit 
For reaching the goal and the dream wouldn't you want to be in it to win it? 

Biters are wanted like animals hunted 
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it to the suckers who fronted 
The rappers who made it and did it 
Forget about winning the battle cause I'mma shake rattle and roll 

A little something for girls and boys and 
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison 

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time 
One step beyond and not behind the line 
That separates dogs from divine 
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign 

Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them 
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's 
With Polo and while he's slicing 
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson 

My brain is like a factory constantly creating 
Material stitch by stitch for decoration 
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining 
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing 

Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it 
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it 
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show 
And my brain glows just like a rainbow 

Rappers and poets they already know it 
G Rap is a terror not a error and never will I stop reaching for better 
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel 
G Rap will make you feel the real deal 

I usually rap hardcore and I know 
That why'all thinking am I somehow semi, so

Musical outcome, lyrical tantrum
Energy enters me, power absorbed
Phonograph arts and crafts mic warlord
Kool G Rap the lyric dictator
DJ Polo the fader operator
Will crush, squash, rhymes are harsh
All spectators will be brainwashed
Sons, daughters, paper reporters
Receive my command and follow our orders
Poetry slavery biters observe
This is hip-hop your optical nerve
Deserves no need to explain
Plain simple, created by the temple, the brain
Maintain order with pain, well

Words I chant my competitors can't
Physical structure is of a power plant
Mic master interpretating faster
Than any perpetrating fraud broadcaster
I display and MC's pray
Cause under x-ray they are Parkay
And artificial down to their initial
In no position to be official
In hip-hop not the surface or the median
I'm at the top you're a clown and a comedian
A big waste of wax plus tax
Your royalties couldn't buy a can of Ajax
Not energetic rhymes are pathetic
My beat is so sweet you'll become a diabetic
Fascinating revolving and rotating
That's how the record starts motivating

Vocally discharging lyrics like magic
Poetical recital is vital and tragic
Strikes are fatal on the mic I label
Me Kool G Rap and Polo on the table
Violators and intruders
I'll exile barbarian style like an executor
Then muta-late later
Copycatters I batter, G Rap impersonators
Brains scatter my rhyme is the solution
Record rotation forms a revolution
The spin extends another plate blends and
It corresponds to the message I've sent
Even destroy boys with a safety pen

DJ Polo,"Love is pain left out in the rain
With nothing to gain but teardrop stains
Being haunted by a memory as I think back
The things we used to do and how we used to act
With love and trust, passion and plussed
Because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
Between us, never argued about
And I never gave a clue for you to figure it out
How I miss being blessed with your sweet finesse
As we kiss and twist and caress on the mattress
Sweet body heat, your heartbeat
I'll grip your hips and both of our lips will meet so neat
Staring up at the moonlight with someone to hold tight
Given a chance for romance until the sunlight
Brightens the sky, it reflects in your eye
But now, the reflection is gone and I cry out

She loves me, she loves me not

Looking at your picture as it sits on the table
As I put on my cable I wish that I was able
To touch but it's a shame that you had to go
So I watch the hands on the clock go real slow
Gone with the wind, is love a sin?
If it is then God, then bring it back again
Not a girl that you rate as a fine blind date
I need a love mate so I can create
So I open a window to feel the wind blow
Try to figure out how can a love end so
Fast and just pass and not even last
First grow like grass, then shatter like glass
Now I stare at the walls, clock five Tylenols
Unplug the telephone to avoid phone calls
As I sit and crave for the love she gave
But when I wake up, I'm the same love slave
Saying

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me

When you lost a good friend, dreams seem to end
Cause broken hearts and men don't blend
So I'm not here to stick every chick I can pick
You move too quick, you become seasick
And a one-night stand is for the one-track mind man
The kind of guy you kick like a can
So I race in space and try to replace the pretty face
But it's a waste, this chase is a kiddy case
Now I whisper how much I missed her
My lips should have blistered the way I kissed her
So soft and slow, laid back and relaxed
And when I move, the groove is as smooth as a sax
She kissed me low and then proceeded up
Bedsheets heated up, the pace is speeded up
Slowly but surely we reach our destiny
She got the best of me and left the rest of me
Now all I got is total confusion
She disappeared and it's not an illusion
My life is bitter, the memories glitter
I feel like dirt, so please do not litter
My heart's deflated, doctors can't rate it
I don't know how the hell I made it
So farewell sweetheart wherever you are
I'll just look at a star, and say yo

DJ Polo,"I run rappers like races, cut them like razors
Burn them like lasers, and stun them like phasers
Cause my brain thinks and it blanks your memory banks
Sharp as shanks and poetry is like a cleat hanks
Give me a pen, a typa-writer then
I'll cut your whole posse into gingerbread men
With diction sparked from friction
Plenty of dope like the pope cause it's a G Rap prediction
Tower going outer space, louder bass
Replaces the weak rap race
Ashes to ashes, flashes of smashes and crashes
Another big man bashes
Fright, it's a silent night but it's a violent fight
My talent might explode like dynamite
Lyrics blast out, all evil will cast out
Fast and at last all rappers passed out
Wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
Clear like crystals, loud like pistols
Here to get it straight for the '89 era
This is a killer G
In a trilogy of terror

Uh
Yeah

Lightning and thunder, rappers going six feet under
Kool G Rap makes you wonder
No blunders or mistakes, this takes hard concentration
Effort, for the method, meditation
Visions of light, collisons, tight decisions
Suckers'll end like divisions
Listen I'm like a seed from a demon, a blessing from an angel
Way more mysterious than Bermuda's Triangle
Riddle fit to hit, put together bit by bit
Like a do-it-yourself kit
Then I'll hold your soul on a remote control
So-called MC's will freeze so cold
Then get viewed and examined in a test tube
If you're a square, you freeze into an ice cube
Talent switches, words to riches
You get stitches, rhymes are wicked like witches

I wanna say something to this girl I know
She tried to play me out though, check it out

This I dedicate to the girl I hate
It's a piece of my mind rhyme put on a plate
So yo, go ahead swinger, I'm putting up my middle finger
I'm not sad or mad, I don't feel anger
You're not all that fly, trying to play the role
I had girls that looked better on the ho stroll
Working night patrol, ya know what I mean?
I get cash and still wear Jordache jeans
You thought your drug-dealing man was much better
Because he always came and got you in a plush Jetta
Or a Audi, a Benz, or a Jaguar
You didn't think G Rap was going that far
I'm here to tell off, because you thought I fell off
And now if you're riding the tip, just get the hell off
You wanted to leave because you didn't believe that I would achieve
Cause you had something up your sleeve
Perhaps you might have thought I'm a dreamer with a fat head
Now you're stuck with a baby from a crack head
Come to my shows, you want to check it to see if I wreck it
The only record your man got is a jail record
I know you like him a lot because he's a big shot
The only picture you got is his mug shot
I'm on a label with well-known singers in it
Look, your man's getting booked and fingerprinted
Polo drives a Benz from state to stae
By the way, guess who made his license plates
Thought I was finished, down, going through the blues
Here's a hundred dollars, go buy some new shoes
Go ahead good looking, you can keep booking
From my recital I'll never get my title tooken
So you got a little 9 to 5, so what?
What do you do for a living, slice cold cuts?
You look slick, but you know every Tom and Dick
You're more quick than a chick from a porno flick
While you scrub floors, I go on tours
From me, G Rap, yo, truly yours

(Yo G man! You should diss her man. Yo I heard he's a homo anyway)

Listen up money, or should I say honey?
You're looking more sweeter than a Playboy bunny
Fingernails filed, your hair is styled
And the gear that you wear looks hot and wild
Everybody says is he, some kind of sissy?
Your name was ""Moose"" but now they call you ""Missy""
Night or day lights, you fight for the gay rights
I thought you would stay bright, but you wanna play fight
With men, and Len, your real close friend
But you wouldn't be his friend if his knees didn't bend
You're not a lady dear, you're a square and a queer
Barrettes in your hair, bamboos in your ear
Running to cars, hanging out in gay bars
Winking your eyes to guys that wear bras
Skintight Levi's and even knee-highs
Don't try to lie, sugar, I know why
In the ladies bathroom, spraying on perfume
Stuffing your t-shirt with two balloons
You don't think about the opposite sex at all
Instead of sugar walls, you'd rather have the balls
Way back in the days, you was as big as a cow
But look at you now, at jams you say ""Ow!""
A sex disease was as common as TB
But gays today get VD in 3-D
And that is called AIDS in case you didn't know
And the only blow I'm giving is this knockout blow
Switching with your bandana looking like Diana Ross
From me G Rap, yo, truly yours

(Hey yo, finish dissing that girl, man)

Yo, do me a favor, and pick up a pen and pad
And try to write down the numbers of the men you've had
So remember when you're putting someone else in check
Go to the Wizard of Oz and get some self-respect
Won't say no names, it might leave a permanent scar
I don't have to go that far, you know who you are
And if you don't, then everybody else does
Cause all the fellas be telling me how good you was
I can't accept a girl with a ruined rep
I'm like a chef, I just cook up the stew and step
Off with her clothes, like Moby Dick, there she blows
She wanna throw like the girls from the peep shows
Your man was large, but now he's getting kinda tiny
And you run up behind me trying to get pregnant by me
And in a year, I bet you'll be on welfare
Don't cry for help dear, you put yourself there
The way it looks, you'll end up in Playboy books
While your man is in Manhattan snatching pocket books
Bugging and mugging with a big 12 gauge
Starving so bad I can see his ribcage
Yo, you used to tell me all the time you're gonna be a model
Later in life, you're living in a crack bottle
So when you're begging on your knees because I'm clocking G's
You'll be in zero degrees getting processed cheese
Wearing dungarees, yo baby I don't need a girl with broken hands
Cause her man's a woman beater
So when you getting sores from giving up your drawers
Remember Kool G Rap said truly yours

Yo, I don't even know why you tried to play me honey

 Because I'm dead and stinking 
 Soles on my shoes winking t shirt is shrinking 
 Soon I see some ties and my eyes open wide quick 
 Who's that with you, chick? Bill Blass my sidekick 
 What's up, black? Give his hand a smack 
 Up pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back 
 Jumped right on inside, not too many people saw us 
 Thinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us 
 The drove us down to the sober section 
 Of town where the clowns don't be paying for protection 
 The want us to send a message to Jimmy the bartender 
 Lend a friend the money next you're ripping off his car fenders 
 He's coming up short cause he snorts 
 Coke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught 
 He owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of em 
 But Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him 
 But Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her 
 Hopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver 
 Blass, you distract him while I go and whack him 
 Entered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him 
 He's screaming for his life, reaching for his wife 
 Shot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife 
 And that goes for anybody who's gotta pay they dues 
 You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues 
 
[Chorus:] 
 You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (repeat 4x) 
 Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers 
 You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors 
 So I got to get with the business of hit quick 
 Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick Slick 
 Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot 
 Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop 
 Hit the deck I got the Tech right on your neck 
 And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveller's check 
 But if a vic' tries to choke me 
 I'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie 
 Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey 
 Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me 
 So to the next weasel that freezes 
 Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus 
 Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck 
 Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a fuck 
 Hyper as a sniper piping niggas like a plumber 
 Cold vicking and sticking up the ones that run the numbers 
 Or even a bigger score, the lady in the liquor store 
 Go inside and kick in the door, pull her then I'm stickin her for 
 Money or your life, honey hurry and choose 
 You lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
 Extra extra read all about it in the papers 
 The boss tried to rape us, so we tossed him off the skyscraper 
 Because he pulled some other people to try and hit us 
 Get us, but none of them did us, he must be trying to kid us 
 But that's dead, I'll thank God in the red, 'cross the bread borders 
 So nobody can short us, he fled down to headquarters 
 Ready to put some work in, we're not a lazy crew, we'll do a job or two 
 But yo, the man can't even stick me with some Crazy Glue 
 Ready to tore him even more because she saw him 
 We took out all the lookouts in the front and kicked his door in 
 What's up snake, why'd you violate? 
 Because I'm a hossa (What's that?) 
 Yo, that's a pig that don't fly straight 
 Getting ready to jab him, I grabbed him by the necktie 
 Homie tried to get fly, and swing I gave him a decked eye 
 You know the evil that men do, hell is where the men go 
 We snatched him by his hands and feet and threw him out the window 
 Up, up, and away cause I don't play, clown 
 Buck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down 
 I'm hoping you got springs and wings on your shoes 
 But you lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues 
 
 [Chorus]",Ill Street Blues,1992
DJ Polo,"""Late last night two undercover police officers were found brutally murdered in a Fort Greene 
Apartment building in Brooklyn New York. At this time police have no suspects. 
Now to the weather but first G tell 'em what time it is!"" 

I got a chance to get some money so I'm takin' it 
No joke because this bein' broke shit just ain't makin' it 
Cause I grew up in the fast line 
See my pops ran the numbers and my moms held the blackjack games 
Now I'm able to leave the cradle 
I don't remember the dinners, only the kilos on my kitchen table 
Sittin' right beside a pistol 
And I'm watchin' my pops, pick up bricks made out of crystal 
While he was countin' the green 
I seen nothin' but strainers, containers, scales and rocks on a triple beam 
People was too afraid to stick him up 
Because he had the most notorious brothers to come and pick him up 
When I reached ten years old 
I never recalled seein' any more money and drugs in the household 
'Cause now pops was on his feet 
And to keep us from gettin' hurt he kept his dirt in the street 
And if he tried to attack, your family's wearin' black 
Because he just got your death, put on a contract 
Another sucker to rub 
Even my mother's walkin' around packin' a .357 snub 
And many cops dropped dead 
I seen a man pull out a pistol and blow off an undercover's head 
'Cause it's hard to get by 
And that's why, when you're young in the streets 
You gotta live and let die 

Some say this ain't the life to choose 
Rage is snapped away you get a page in the Daily News 
But I just want to get paid off 
'Cause if I was workin' a regular nine to five I'd get laid off 
Some people say, sellin' weight, is a death date 
But I can't wait, to set up shop, in the next state 
I ain't worried bout a brother tryin' to take mines 
'Cause my plot comes with a hundred shot nine 
Police are right on my heels 
But I'm always one step ahead of the punks makin' dope deals 
They can't stop me 'cause I'm proper 
And if they ever try to raid they better bring choppers or helicopters 
I broke a lot of punks ribs 
Dumpin' they bodies in lots, then I ran and shot up the cribs 
Because a brother ain't fakin' it 
If there's a record for killin' the most niggaz then yo I'm breakin' it 
I wish a brother would flex 
I spray him up and then take all of his money and give his girl sex 
That's how I'm livin' in the street 
You either give a sucker two in the head, or you'll be dead meat 
I'm sendin' punks six feet deep 
And gettin' money in lumps, cause this ain't Twenty-One Jump Street 
You want to stop what I supply 
Aiyyo, the hell with that, I gotta live and let die 

Police, police! Everybody down, everybody down! 
Don't fucking move, get down! 
Hey, where is everybody? 
Look, there's nobody here 
What's that fucking noise?  
It's a bomb, it's a bomb, let's go 
Get the fuck out of here! 

You gotta live and let die 
Forget all that bullshit about savin' the soul 
Some chump'll pump your ass full of bullet holes 
So I'm out to make a killin' 
And all you suckers are chillin' 'cause I ain't just an ordinary villain 
I got a rep for mass murder 
If you look bigger, I just pull the trigger, a female I just hurt her 
I got the .38 long 
But a dame can get the same if she's comin' out of her mouth wrong 
And if you try to oppose this 
Next time you see your mother she'll be covered with roses 
It ain't about a fair fight 
Because I only get open for smokin' suckers in daylight 
Another punk bites the dust 
'Cause I just bust blood out your butt like pus 
The broke life I ain't missin 
Because now I got a lot, and that's more than a pot to piss in 
And if I'm sellin you ki's 
Just put the G's on the bed, and then go head and take a freeze 
And while you're numbin' your tongue with the yum yum 
I pull out a gun, cause I want every last crumb 
I put a slug in your face 
Then I waits to start packin' the trap back in the suitcase 
Another punk had to fry 
I don't want to do it but yo I gotta live and let die

DJ Polo,"I got a job with the mob, makin G's
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie
I'm ridin around with ten kilos inside my trunk G
And I'm holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin face
And I'm tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to make a motherfuckin run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? They'll find me floatin in the Hudson river
But if I escape, I'll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I'm supposed to make a stop
To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
Cause I'm sick of puttin my motherfuckin ass on the line
I got the money and the hit
Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain't droppin off shit
Then I thought of a plan
So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man
C'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready
""God damn why your face all sweaty?""
Just hurry up and get the shit
I'm a dead man bitch, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin like I was goin on a motherfuckin world tour
Grabbed my bags and my gun
C'mon we gotta go... I'm on the motherfuckin run

Now I'm drivin and I'm lookin at my passport
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport
I loaded up the automatic
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin traffic
I'm gettin nervous as a fuck see
A Lincoln Continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low
*gunfire, breaking glass* Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin italian motherfuckers in the neck
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin up a motherfucker
Niggaz runnin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by fuckin inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm
Now I'm drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is catchin motherfuckin heartburns
I got the car shakin wildly
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin shit is done
I'm on the motherfuckin run

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin on my hoe
""c'mon man what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin South no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
I pulled it -- bullets started flyin
Now I'm hittin all them bastards
I'm droppin em fast, splashin blood out niggaz asses
Then I'm finally done and
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?""
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk""
I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun
Now I'm no longer on the motherfuckin run",On the Run,1992

I hop into the hot tub
To lay back and relax and get a scrub and a back rub
Sippin on some wine
The view is dope, you see the Manhattan skyline
I got it made in the game
No stress, no worries, the only pain is the champagne
Put on the silk bathrobe
I liveth the life, plus I been around the globe
Throw on a Barry white tape
While girls file my fingernails and feed me grapes
Step on a paddy-o and look at the city
No need to look for a girl, I got three right here with me
I'm gettin paid all at once
And I got money in jackets I didn't wear in five months
Nothin come up but fast bread
And I be countin it all while I'm layin in a brass bed
I got a maid and a chauffeur
Girls comin over, sit on a plush leather sofa
I got a smile on my face
Bank accounts and chase group signings inside my pillow case
Now I'm livin kinda fat
Cause I came from the street and made a g with a rap
Now you know what my name is
G rap livin the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

Spendin money like water
Rich men across the border offer me their daughter
And I'm never in a slump
Cause my big pockets got more lumps than donald trump's
Pretty women in my face, see
Took Gayle to Bloomingdale's and met Tracy at Macy's
Suckin on money like a vacume
Never got it hard, cause I got credit cards that are platinum
Not to mention the gold visa
Got a safe in the wall behind paintings of Mona Lisa
Chandeliers in the hall
Ten stuffed deer heads are on my living room wall
More bills than Stills & Nash
I like to flash, cause I got more stash than johnny cash
Gold faucets on my sinks
Inside of my bedroom I got at least 20 fish tanks
I got power, and I'm known
See, I can call the president up straight on that red phone
So now you know what my game is
It's the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

[ verse 3 ]
I get the opposite sex
Cause while I write out checks, diamonds are shinin in my rolex
My clout is outrageous
I'm on the phone with the owners of casinos in las vegas
Lookin heavy every day
I wear a pair of shoes once, and I'm throwin em away
Everything is like a breeze
I hired mp's just to guard all my ki's
Girls throwin lilies in my path
I got a yacht that makes the love boat look like a life raft
Mega-mega-mega-bucks
To make a deposit, I gotta call up armored trucks
Smilin while I'm stylin
I gave a girl her first lesson in sex on the virgin islands
Cause I'm the real money maker
More bread than a baker, the dead-president undertaker
A young brother gettin notes
I flew to london for the fog, just because I had the coat
So much money to spill
Whoever's not in my will might even get a mill
You want a car? that's miniature
No cash, don't sweat it, because my credit is my signature

DJ Polo,"Ladies and gentlemen 
Back by popular demand 
We got cool G Rap and Polo 
Singin it is now 
Rhyme Tyme 

 
I be funky to a junkie cause the rhyme is dope 
I use my microphone wire like a cowboy rope 
So I can lasso any rapper that think they can cope 
And the microphone is my horror scope 
Magnificient and excellent cause I'm no scrub 
I could rock in a club with only one light bulb 
All I need is a mic and a crowd to react 
And I'll turn a damn jam into Radio Shack 
All suckers in a place I'll erase and replace 
Just in case you want to copy and trace 
My word is superb, intoxicates like herb 
Orally, musically, and mentally disturbed 
Soundwaves are outrageous 
I'm brave and courageous 
Fillin up pages for ages and ages 
Released to rock, too acquiesced to shock 
All biters get writer's block 
When it's rhyme tyme 

To play this game you gotta be a rap pro 
It's not dominos or tic tac toe 
It's the rhyme tyme game, it challenges the brain 
Strategy is the key to unlock the chain 
My lips do not chat when I start to rap 
Project my voice so loud, my tonsils flat 
Excellence defense on the phonograph 
Is DJ Polo, he's cooler than Shaft 
Fresher than a item that you find inside a deli 
Fatter than the man that they call the Fonzarelli 
Colder than a icey, hotter than chili 
Rap in every language, I can say it in Suaheli 
My body has a flavor, girls says I'm lickable 
Daffy Duck-MC's call it despicable 
I say it's similar to fat, incredible 
I got a taste, but it's not edible 
I'm goin' down as a MC champ 
Kinda wet on the set, but it's just damp 
Some day you'll see my face on a US stamp 
Like Evil Knievel I jump and I ramp 
In my rap I'm like an other Johnny Dangerously 
I can do two things simultaneously 
I can rap real fast and speed it up, and not a word you'll miss 
I can slow - down - at - times - just - like - this 
I can rap, stop - start it again 
Then count to ten 
With a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
So there, my friend 
I can box, do karate, or even do judo 
Rap in spanish, but I'm not Menudo 
Ask me why I classify 
My rhymes will terrify 
It's rhyme tyme 

Now I could rap to your sister 
Or rap a tongue twister 
Those who want to bite it, it makes your lip blister 
Cause I'm the guidin light, I recite on the mic 
For parasites who bite it's gonna be frightnight 
Mighty microphone phantom, my rhymes are fiery 
Because of biters I write em in my diary 
So don't dare, my idea is ideal 
Polo is on the wheels of steel for real 
??? this division the like micanician 
What I wrote is voted unanymous decision 
Eardrums are struck when he conducts a cut 
If a sucker deejays, he gives an uppercut 
Just like a dog cool G Rap will train 
Every bitin MC that went insane 
At the top I will maintain 
I'm not a lamebrain 
I leave a bloodstain to show I give pain 
Not a skinny dipper, a fat rolly-polly 
My hair is very curly, it's like a ravioli 
I'm very good at physic, and also scientific 
My rappin has a meanin just like a hieroglyphic 
The rhyme is very hot, you gotta blow on it to bite it 
Sometimes I just recite it, but usually I write it 
Girls make me grow just like Pinocchio 
Before the show I go: ""Geronimo!"" 
Makin a video inside the studio 
Never had the chicken pocks, the measels, mumps or polio 
And you'll be sorry when you bite what I create 
You say to yourself: ""i shoulda had a v-a"" 
Like the mayor I'm a ???, love Pina Colada 
In Copacabana with cherry and banana 
Captivate your mind at the drop of a dime

Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others
You can discover, kids fathers and mothers
A meltin' pot, no one felt they got prejudice
Listen I could never assist someone diss this

Havin' fun, without one bein a fake snake
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed
I believe, we all breathe the same seed
Unless it's diluted, for somethin' to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin' in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin' Indians
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom
Take a taste and erase the racism

[Chorus]
The ink is black, the page is white
Together we learn how to read and write
People are black, got people that's white
LYo V, bring that beat in
Yeah that's aight
Ahhh man!
Yo G, yo Kool G, yo
I'm doin this right here
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
Because you know, we came a long way
You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X
[Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see
Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free
We gonna talk about this, is he gonna talk about this racism
Stop that, you know what I'm sayin', we gonna stop that
So G, why don't you just do your rhymin' part, and then I'll come on after you
(Aight, check it out, here we go, yo)

[Verse One: Kool G Rap]

I'm tryin' hard to explore, I'm not sure
What all the racial war for
It's makin' me more sore
I walk through a color blind corridor
Seekin', for peace in the people I'm meetin'
Black white and Puerto-rican men are greetin' each other
Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others

And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst
Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse
We got to better this world of prejudice
People, make peace, and learn to live equal
'Cause I don't look at myself as a
Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build
A united nation, eliminate segregation
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly
And we can all live together in harmony
Without thinkin' what color is harmin' me
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To E-R-A-S-E the racism

To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
And I hope they stop racism and it's comin' from our hearts

DJ Polo,"[Verse One:] 
 When I was five years old I realized there was a road 
 At the end I will win lots of pots of gold 
 Never took a break never made a mistake 
 Took time to create 'cause there's money to make 
 To be a billionaire takes hard work for years 
 Some nights I sheded tears while I sent up prayers 
 Been through hard times even worked part time 
 In a seafood store sweepin floors for dimes 
 I was sort of a porter takin the next man's order 
 Breakin my back for ?a shack for headquarters? 
 All my manpower for four bucks an hour 
 Took the time, I wrote rhymes in the shower 
 Shoes are scoffed 'cause the road gets rough 
 But I'ma rock it til my pockets ain't stuffed enough 
 All the freaks wouldn't speak 'cause my checks was weak 
 They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek 
 A way to get a play, and maybe one day 
 I'll be performin up a storm for a decent pay 
 No matter how it seems I always kept the dream 
 All the girlies scream and suckas get creamed 
 Dreamed about it for five years straight 
 Finally I got a break and cut my first plate 
 The road ain't yellow and there ain't no witches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
[Verse Two:] 
 I used to stand on the block sellin cooked up rock 
 Money bustin out my sock 'cause I really would clock 
 They were for kind of fiends bringin jackets and jeans 
 Magazines, anything, just to hustle for beans 
 The cash was comin fast, money grew like grass 
 People hungry for the blast that don't even last 
 Didn't want to be involved but the money will getcha 
 Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture 
 But I still supplied, some people I knew died 
 Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide 
 Money, jewelry, livin like a star 
 And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car 
 In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino 
 For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino 
 I shot up stores and I kicked down doors 
 Collecting scars from little neighborhood wars 
 Many legs I broke, many necks I choked 
 And if provoked I let the pistol smoke 
 Loyal members in a crew now down with the game 
 Sellin nickels and dimes, sunshine or rain 
 What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad 
 In the first time in my life loanin money to dad 
 Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
 [Verse Three:] 
 A thug a-mugs? for drugs, he eventually bugs 
 Lookin for crack on carpets and rugs 
 The squealers tells? but the dealer still sells 
 Little spoiled kids inheritin oil wells 
 I was the type on the opposite side 
 Of smokin the pipe, in a beef I got hype 
 'cause rags to riches switches men to witches 
 Become stitches, body bags in ditches 
 Bloodshed, I painted the town red 
 People fled as I put a dread's head to bed 
 That mean's dead, in other words deceased 
 Face got erased, bullets got released 
 Bombs were planted, the kids were kidnapped 
 In fact that was a way to get back 
 At enemies who tried to clock G's 
 on my block, now they forever knock Z's 
 Plans of rampages went for ages 
 Some got knocked and locked inside cages 
 Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts 
 In God We Trust, now rots to rust 
 Plus caps to cops, policeman drops 
 You blew off his top when the pistol went pop 
 Troopers, soldiers, rollin like boulders 
 Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder 
 Some young male put in jail 
 His lawyer so good his bail is on sale 
 Lookin at the hourglass, how long can this power last? 
 Longer than my song but he already fell 
 He likes to eat hardy, party 
 Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati 
 Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello 
 Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello 
 One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate 
 But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes 
 And than a-wait and wait and wait 
 Til he breaks, that's all it takes 
 So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand 
 On his own two feet because now he's in a new land 
 Rules are different and so is life 
 When you think with a shank, talk with a knife 
 Not my lifestyle so I made a you-turn 
 More money I earn, more money to burn 
 Pushin all buttons, pullin all switches 
 My name is G. Rap, I'm on the road to the riches",Road to the Riches,2000
DJ Polo,"It's a demo

People in the audience Kool G Rap is my name
I write rhymes and insert them inside your brain
And DJ Polo, the man I'm behind
He operates the turntables when I'm rocking my rhymes, see

It's a demo

Psychopath on the phonograph, nut of the cuts
You heard the boy slice, is he nice or what?
He's the main entertainer inside the show
And he goes by the name of DJ Polo, see

It's a demo

I supply the data, he's the wheel operator
We're walking tall and we're called The Terminators
I'm Kool G Rap, and he's Polo
He cuts like a pro when I go solo
He's a record spinner winner, that you can bet
Eats DJ's for dinner on his table set
With cuts he concocts and the party rocks
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer
One hundred percent excellent entertainer
The maker and creator of the lyrical line
Idea of Shakespeare, the mind of Einstein
Surrender, pretender, you don't exist
As a vocalist, so you can kiss this
I'm Kool G Rap, greatest of all times
And you can see it, inside my rhymes
See it's a demo

It's a demo

My recital will form a musical brainstorm
Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn
The performer recites, competitors ignite
Audiences tonight I came to incite
Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult
Equivalent to a thousand volts
To my brief rap speech you attach like a leech
Examine when I'm jamming and when I preach
Before I'm completed, you will all be deleted
You said I sucked, instead I succeeded
Fan fascinator, I supply data
According to the groove, I'm a real smooth operator
I activate a musical device
Dialogues are concise, no need to splice
My system contains musical rap rain
Instrumentals inserted inside your brain
All levels rate low with a medium tempo
I give a dramatical cameo show
And now you know DJ Polo
These party people are ready to go
See it's a demo

It's a demo

Better than a Snicker when it comes to a snack
I go solo with Polo when I'm in combat
I'm the MC humanoid and I just get annoyed
Boy you'll be destroyed cause you copy like a Polaroid
Coming like a meteor inside any area
Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise
The microphone fanatic, cause I'm the Asiatic
Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatic
Ly suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate
Mutilate at a rate to penetrate you
No other crew can rescue
My talents are balanced my audience is silent
MC's stop biting or I'll get violent
It's a demo

It's a demo

I take a scene to the extreme
To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream
So don't even quote what you write is dolt
Your rhymes are small-time through a microscope
More cooler than an Ice Ages
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages
Different stages of rage that I'm going through
And like an owl, you'll know who to
Feed your greed, you want and need
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed
Cause my fury is scary
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying
Then I release steam like a radiator
And attack MC's like a gladiator
As my talent proceeds to grow, yo
This ain't the end of the show, it's a demo

It's a demo",It's a Demo,2002
DJ Polo,"This is poison so be alert and cautious
Those who act courageous you will get nauseous
Infected or contaminated
Turn on your stereo never come radio-activated
Deadly and fatal, poison the title
My recital hits the parts that are vital
So tune in the tone of beats and poems
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones
Pull out your Q-tips, clean out the earwax
If you're still hard of hearing
I'mma scrub them with Ajax
With maximum drum so behave and remember
You're a slave to my sound wave
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find
A new method time after time
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper
Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper
Like cherries or some say berries
Mandatory for the auditorium's glory
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me
G speaks in a new technique of fury
Combination of drums and noise and
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison

Poison!

Look-alikes on the mic you should get off
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get
Rid of, cause you bit off
Bite off, ate off. Imitate off
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
Male or female shut them up, Polo shut her up

Yo, you heard what he said shut the hell up, man

Yeah, hide my line as you pick them up
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as
Well have said: ""stick 'em up.""
Letters of metaphor matters to
Better the fatter your pocket
Rhymes blast off like rockets
Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass
Made in a minute the sky is the limit
For reaching the goal and the dream
Wouldn't you want to be in it to win it?
Biters are wanted like animals hunted
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it
To the suckers who fronted
The rappers who made it and did it
Forget about winning the battle cause
I'mma shake rattle and roll
A little something for girls and boys and
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison

Read the label sucker
P-O-I-S-O-N yeah, Poison

Poison!

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates dogs from divine
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign
Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's
With Polo and while he's slicing
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson
My brain is like a factory constantly creating
Material stitch by stitch for decoration
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing
Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show
And my brain glows just like a rainbow
Rappers and poets they already know it
G Rap is a terror not a error and never
Will I stop reaching for better
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel
G Rap will make you feel the real deal
I usually rap hardcore and I know
That y'all thinking am I somehow semi, so
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and
Remember Kool G Rap, Doc the Butcher and Polo is poison",Poison,2002
DJ Pone,"Pardon de n'avoir su rayer
Les mots qu'il fallait travestir
Et puis d'en avoir oublié
Les jaloux qu'ils ont fait souffrir

Et qu'on m'excuse auprès des juges
Qui ont dû en rougir

Je vous laisserai me dévêtir

Applaudir ma témérité
De vous parler pour ne rien dire

You niggas want beef, I feed it to you raw in tiny, small portions

Spitten, created for the part of use only if it's hard-hittin

Maintain, hold it down, claim the victory over the golden crown

DJ Pooh,"I got an idea... 

I had a plan to grow indo' 
Therefore the outdo' was to be recreated, duplicated in a grow room 
Wanted to produce the kinda plant that you could display up in a showroom 
So beautiful, but yet stinky 
Stick to your thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky 
And the brain 
First thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation 
Discrete location 
Ten by ten foot spot 
Lit up by a thousand watt lamp, plus two air-vents for the air to circulate 
And ehm - I calculate 
30 gallons of water a week, I'm really into this 
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis 
To proceed, after I choose the right seeds to fall in motion 
With a little love and devotion 
I can make the front cover of High Times 
I hope I never get busted and have to pay some fines 
For havin' a, secret garden, like Barry White 
I must not tell anyone and keep my lips sealed tight 
I got the grow room 

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 

During the first stage of growth the seeds germinate slow 
Start a root system, sprout up some leaves, and grow 
Towards the light 
Make sure the temperature's right 
I was told by this one guy 
Watch your plants closely, beware of bugs and fungi 
They'll hurt your garden, they'll only interfere 
With the vegetative growth that lasts about two months to a year 
When full grown flowers bloom big buds and leaves 
Watch out for thieves 
People like to stash shit up their sleeves 
It's not been three months 
I'm tempted to break off a piece and roll some blunts 
I wonder what it is, is this some Skunk? 
I see some purple stems and orange hairs 
Could it be the Humble mixed with Maui? It's a hybrid 
Wow! Look what I did 
I got the green thumb 
Observe the superb herb 
Bushy branches, loud smell 
Like green pastel 
I got it on deck for all seasons 
And if anyone asks, it's for medical reasons 
I got the grow room

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 

It's been over four months, time to get high 
Uproot the plants and let them hang dry 
In a cool room with dry air, for 2 to 3 weeks 
And I'ma be waitin' right here with my loose leaf sheets 
The lovely harvest, it came in different amounts 
Four trees, each one just a few grams short of an ounce 
I can't wait to smoke it, I know it's the bomb 
Been waiting so long, make me want to write a song 
I guess I'll sell 2 ounces and puff on the rest 
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my fillet of chicken breast 
Or some tea shot full of THC 
Hit the bomb, cut open the swisher sweet 
Then come off on weed 
Plant stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down 
And when lit, the fruity herby taste is profound 
It have me buzzin' for a light year, and you best believe I'll have some seeds 
And be at it again, yes indeed 
I got the grow room 

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope",Grow Room,1997

[ VERSE 1 ] 

MC's   you need deeper concentration 

Cause wack rhymes and crews lead to non profit organizations 

I attack like anxiety with the variety 

>From the western society   baby 

Seeing is believing  but looks can be deceiving 

You might think you're coming with it  nigga  but you're leaving 

With lyrics I'm conceiving 

Morning, afternoon and evening 

You can't wait 

My shit's special like a .38 

(You got a problem?) 

I smoke some boo boo, now I'm spaced out like astrology 

Getting in MC's asses like proctology 

It's seems that everybody's going through a phase 

Thinkin they can bust, but they're weak like 7 days 

All 12 months for every ounce I get 12 blunts 

Get the munchies, eat up 12 MC's at once 

Thinkin that they wasn't, when they know that they was 

The one with the style young, they still got the peachfuzz 



(What goes up 

Must come down) 

(What goes up...) 

(MC's) (...must come down) 



[ VERSE 2 ] 

When I get stoned like Fred Flint I begin 

To smoke MC's like Marian, bury them 

Cause most be comin unnatural like a cesarean 

I wish my rhymes were meat and MC's were vegetarians 

Cause when it comes to biting, I don't condone it 

Besides, you couldn't manage my style if you owned it 

I got gruesome rhymes in my mind 

And they'll jump on a beat 

Infect it when the rhyme is injected 

Metaphors are connected 

Booty lyrics are deflected 

And the mic is intercepted 

Cause I never ever leave it neglected 

I'm tryina hold my position 

What kind of man would I be if my rhymes weren't in mint condition 

They say ""(Hey) Grimm's nowhere to be found"" 

But they catch me on camera beatin MC's down 

Always tryin to ponder what I'm pondering 

They need to find theyself, because they're somewhere lost and wandering 



(What goes up 

Must come down) 

(What goes up...) 

(MC's) (...must come down) 



[ VERSE 3 ] 

As we mix a little lyric and track 

Like coke and cognac 

Premium blend 

You're gonna need a driver, designated friend 

Cause I intend to seep in your system 

Hit hard, make MC's change agenda 

Disregard their rhymes, return to sender 

I got soul like Dr. Scholl eatin a bowl of neckbones 

I like my shit loud enough to where it blows your headphones 

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys makin hits 

Assassination other crews, posses, and clicks 

The main thing's to get down and say my peace 

Whoever disrespects, I'm Rushen like Patrice 

I'll never cease with the funky, funky vocals and beats 

Cause we need more rappers around flauntin new styles and speaks 

I know we're amped to get the money, cause we need it 

But if your lyrics ain't tight, the whole purpose is defeated 

You can't shine and be on top with the wack sound 

It's time to watch all the burnt out stars hit the ground",MC's Must Come Down,1997

How much mo' can I take
I'm all alone in a world gone mad
Brothers is doin bad
I had hopes and dreams, it seems like though nobody care
Who says life is fair cause ain't no justice out here nowhere
I prepare myself to hold court right here in the street
Don't come at me with no b.s., homie, give me five feet
I can't get no sleep, peace and quiet or rest
I got ulcers, migraines and pains in my chest
So God bless my soul, I feel old when I'm not
But physically and mentally I'm going through a lot
I know my time on this big blue baloon is short
Stress and pray everyday while people playin sport
Worry myself sick, so I be tryin to stay active
But death is lookin more and more attractive
Lord have mercy, why me, I know you ain't make no mistake

And I don't want to see no friends until I get my ends right
I got enough problems, and it's messin up my health
I keep puttin my family and friends before myself
When I'm the one who need help but too proud to ask for it
When there's somethin wrong with me why'all be the last to know it
Cause I don't show it, I handle it and privately suffer
Havin patience is a mutha
Trials and tribulations, that's how my lessons begin
I'm overpowered by death and the impressions of men
I'm tryin to overcome these obstacles that I meet

The chosen sperm to explore and reach the egg for sure
A child through the birth canal on the nine mo' trial
Released on this wild earth, my generation hit worst
Will my development arrested by the government
Younga niggas strugglin', livin' life got me wonderin'
New shit I'm discoverin', yo son I can't sleep
Situation so deep, my niggas drownin' in the streets
Another rapist'll stalk, a younger murder is walked
They got shit locked in a fort, a buck fif' if you're tossed
Verbalizin' hard times, findin' ways to recline
Dedicated to the rhyme brought your shades and your wine
I survived hard times prime time, as I rewind

Rest in peace to my peeps who died up in the streets
Fuck Halloween treats cause ain't shit sweet

Change, my life has changed

Growin' up on the Brooklyn streets
It was hard for Black T to make these motherfuckin ends meet
The first store that closed up got stuck
and if you didn't gimme your cash
I'd put one in somebody's gut
I ran buckwild through these streets with this group of individuals
committing crimes well performed like a ritual
Until one day my momz tried to send me up-state to job core
I didn't know what the fuck for
So I, pulled out my pals
And called up the nigga Al
What's the deal son it's been a fuckin' long while
He said yo Black T, I had this dream about this cream
I'm going all out for mines by any fuckin' means
We grabbed our pen and pads
And wrote about this world gone mad
And how times was getting real bad
But what we need to do
Is connect with them other two
And make that dream you had come true

I'm out the front door
Don't want to deal with this bullshit no more
What for? I'm ready to throw this heart on the floor
Back in the days, yo, Ty had it all
Women on call, sex and all
Summer, winter, spring, and the fall 
Then my momz broke out to get away from men why no doubt
Then I settled down and made one girl a spouce
Should of known, couldn't replace momz
My heart rang the alarm, situation was da bomb
I roamed the streets, started smokin weed
Drinkin Heinie's tappin' hinies
Writin' words to rich beats
Became an everyday stuggler
Stereotyped a hustler
Constant bother
Resided with my father frequently talked with my mother
Reactions crazy, revenge thoughts, maybe
Asking what am I doin here
Someone come save me 
'Cause I feel I got no purpose
Dabilatino surface
There's different type moves
With an attitude that's nervous
And nothing can help me maintain my mind frame
Now I'm doing shit I never did before

Change, my life has changed
Change, (change) and I will never be the same
Change, the world has changed
Change, (change) and it will never be the same

Brought up on green and patch
You'll never have no ash
and everyday I find myself in the same old fashion
Saddened, my same fuckin' Pumas and Lees
Tore up at the knees
That would always squeeze
My buns, I have no funds
I'm young and dumb
Left school at three o' clock
To face an eviction
In tears as it appears my crib for years
Has just been rented to the landlord kids
No rhythm, cause my rep grows rather rash
Surpassed third class quick to stash, when the photo flash
In contrast, I was labeled as an outcast
Afraid to tell the cast
Cause chicks can tell me kiss they ass
Low self esteem but mom dukes kept me clean
Swayed from Spalding, Paydays and madman drinks
Shantlell my princess, she will live to be a queen
And as the moonbeam
Me and my team we'll be countin' cream

Change, my life has changed 
Change, (change) and I will never be the same

DJ Premier,"[Chorus:]
Yo, you suckers is playin' a role
You niggaz is out of control
This world could swallow you whole
The evil could snatch your soul


Yo nigga put the gun away, or you get done away
If not today there'll be a bullet for you one day
The gun play used to be the forte
As a youth, bustin' shots off the roof for horseplay
But once you get a glimpse of the shots, flyin' at you
You think about the possibility of dying and that's true
You won't be stressin' the gun my son
You'll be askin' the Lord for a chance, just one
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
Read it in revelations, check the configuration
They poison our population no matter your occupation
No matter your congregation, this is a troubled nation

[Chorus x2] 

I've seen the worst of the worst, I've seen the best of the best
Seems like the weight of the world is ridin' on my chest
A universal pain, my soul has absorbed
Don't respect no phonies, don't pay attention to frauds
The Lord only knows the depths of my sorrow
And some don't follow because their brains are hollow
So swallow these words and observe the signs
Yo turbulent times, are disturbin' the minds
of the youth, and ghetto life, is the proof
The only skills that's taught, is how to cock and to shoot
Poverty crack guns, hustlers stack ones
Take money is the motto cause we all lack funds

[Chorus x2] 

Nobody owes you nuttin' so you better get yours
My desire flows like sweat, from my open pores
My sores heal, but still the scars remain
A lot of niggaz gonna feel, much more pain
But yo I guess that's life, it don't make things right
Been through a lot of fights, cause ignorance makes me uptight

Cause can't none of why'all bitches ever stand in my place
Pop the Remi, some for L, Tah, 'Pac and Biggie
Really? Niggaz want to stop the jiggy?
Fuck a willie, still you know you gots to dig me

Then I told 'em, ""Do that again, I'mma fuck you up""
Now take a journey through a nigga's psyche
The only snitch in my life is the chick tryna split up me and wifey
You think you like me, I'm aight with that
I don't even call my nigga Budden ""Mouse"", it sound too much like a rat
So may your steps be just like your stacks
High, afraid of death, having a life attack

One deep on your city streets nigga, no hawk or no Glock
No blades in your mouth or box cutters in socks
Cause real niggas show love and bad bitches on your jock
Every corner got a homie you know well
Even if somebody see a deal, then they won't tell
Your man say he got the goods, so you trying him out
The ice cream truck roll through, you buying 'em out
The youngstas helping out the old folks, with something hard to do
The kids is playing, nobody beefing and it's a barbeque
And every backyard with the old school jams on
Sweet potato pie courtesy of your grandma
Already, everybody's home, nobody on the yard
We drinking and smoking the night away with no regard
Nobody arguing and everything's good

Sit on that project bench and have some of the funnest nice
We spend that wrong doing making money the summer right
The smell of somebody barbeque got my stomach hype
'tata salad, rice and some chicken, a little something light
A beast with the cards, they always ask me to shuffle twice
Swear that I be cheating, I'm just fucking nice, cut that
Rug rat, niggas that robbed, never tried your boy
Only just me, no security that I employ
I never need to wear iron toy, I ain't naive
I just hang with some killers and I'm their pride and joy

DJ Khaled!

And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to heal you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya
(Bitch) I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked Hip Hop

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
""She's dead!"" and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck Hip Hop",Hip Hop,2012

DJ Q-Bert,"It's Del baby back again now,
Shit gone change and it ain't gone change
Wanna play games That's out of Your Range
I got, mad brains I interpret things
Precisely pick em apart, my day start with art
Foul remarks are met with the tart
Attitude, that is rude boy, buddy embark on a Journey
Boy the tumble and dry keep turning
I be burning the midnight oils
Computer screens glaze while my ideas coil
I'm a Leo, I veto my ego, when I greet all my peoples I see through the evil
Can't outfox this, I'm cautious with gob stoppers
Who pop they choppers, uh uh
No go, I said so. you're flaky like the outside bread on an egg roll
Diesel, the measles, you don't wanna catch those
Slap foes, dap bros, welcome to the black hole
Lets all act now unless you cracked out
My mouth spit math out, hope you don't pass out

And we can do this with a bit of
Samba Soul
I want yall to really get wit it let it hit your in the
Soul
Can you dig it, can you dig, can you dig it?
Yeah yeah yeah...

Out of sight, I knew you could so lets roll and get down with this
Soul

Diesel neither come back or flow back, know that
Cut off a limb this shit grow back
Slip it a kojak, blaze up a drosack
Just so I can get in the Bo black
Hoes that's
Difficult, Just cause they weak inside, like speakin lies
I'll ignore them, symptom of boredom
Whores come in dozens, plus they a dime a dozen
No time for frontin', better find em something
My motto is don't be sayin' shit you don't be doin and you wont be ruined
I don't be foolin', I hope these useless gooses stop the foolishness
They're excuses merely lead to my
Inclusive clairvoyance about a fear of enjoyment
Of hoes tryna snare em a billionaire boyfriend
Bitch your pussy's not gonna hold me
My mind calisthenics is my whole motif, my flow go deep
Know those streets from the solo creep
Know those beats
So don't sleep, that's how you get taken unaware
Aching for a Share, hatin' on a playa
Never wanna look toward, just sit there and look bored
And got the nerve to be materialistic when knowledge ain't nowhere on their wish list

And then they blow they whole goal
Don't even recognize inside they own soul
And then they blow they whole goal
Don't even recognize inside they own soul

And we can do this with a bit of
Samba Soul
I want y'all to really get wit it let it hit you in the
Soul
Can you dig it, can you dig, can you dig it?

Out of sight, I knew you could so lets roll and get down with this
Soul

D-E-L the man you know he'll rock it too
Whenever you hand him a microphone to use
He is down to business, you know that he don't play
So just bear witness to that Samba Soul he display

And we can do this with a bit of
Samba Soul
I want y'all to really get wit it let it hit your in the
Soul
Can you dig it, can you dig, can you dig it?
Yeah yeah yeah...

Out of sight, I knew you could so lets roll and get down with this

DJ Q-Bert,"I'm a rider and provider and I don't tolerate ho shit
I Bun B out on emcees meaning I obliterate yo' shit
Man, every time I try to like a rapper they turn and do ho shit
Make me ski mask on they a-a-ass, run they jewels and mo shit

You looking at the guy who the guy that you think that 
I got my style from got his own style from ('sup?)
I came with a sly wink and a shit grin with a pimp limp and a foul tongue
I'm a Brooklyn son, set adrift in a chemtrail sky
Bad guys knock when the doors are locked, I got no shots left, better prep for God
Not long, He'll be talkin the same shit, I am just impossible
Got a right to be hostile, motherfucker life is a coffin, layin' down in it ain’t awesome
Every single moment you spend in the dirt is a worse time than the last moment, own it
We all know you don't know shit (no shit!)
Me and Mike will straight write your obit

And the obit goes like this: ""Here lies a punk bitch, real fuck boy type
Who never want shit, 'bout as soft as his momma's own tit""
And sensitive as his old lady's clit, real bust-out bitch
She fuck my clique, obscene, absurd with the words
I cleaned up curbs with the blood and the bones of you nerds
I kill with the mic and murder with words
I'm known on the corners where murders occur, I cruise in the verse where murderers lurk
When god in the building, who they gonna hurt

Not a butterfly, bunny, bee, bird bein' hurt
Got a third-rock-from-the-sun claim for the turf
Never learned how to love, gimme brain then it burnt
Yeah that hurts, but at worst it will already start
With a curse in the heart that'll hurt til it's worse

Bttt Stick, Bttt Stick!
Let that four-fifth turn and twist em
If they all got the mark we miss em
I pray death come quick and kiss em
If he need help I assist him
Follow? All of my tips is hollow
I could kill your ass today but right now I’m playin' Grand Theft Auto
Brain check
I’m just come through your hood, and just shoot your ass tomorrow
Brain dead
Scattered over the hood of my old lady’s brand new auto
Man, knew I should have kept it G and drove my Monte Carlo
It got like this, it shake in pieces, I shoot your ass again tomorrow
Bang!

Ok, I’m an asshole, kiss me (good luck!)
Break a leg in a bear trap, skippy
Wasn’t in class when the lunch bell rang
Due to Colt 45 plus smoke got shitty
Mike already a help assist with me
Tag team of the goddamn century
I never asked for shit, it ain’t in me
You go to work now, but the style haunts history
No doubt I’m a dick, fuck with me
Liberty bell cracked, the cops aren’t kidding
The rabbit in the hat is all deaf now, ain't it?
Came for the freedom, stayed for the prison
Came for the women, stayed for the money
Presidents are better worth dead to feed tummies
You came for the brains, but you stayed for the fucking
The money’s by the side of the bed, it ain’t nothing",Pew Pew Pew,2013

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door

[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist] 
They want to know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a hoe, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your hoe
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
""Hey nigga where you goin'?""
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
y'all niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes.

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm ""The Answer"" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, ""if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs.""

DJ Quick,"Here we go 
Yo a day in the life of a player named Quik 
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick 
And just because I drink the 8  they say that I'm hopeless 
But I don't give a fuck  so blame it on the loc est 
Now this is how we do it when we checkin' a grip 
Teddy Bear's in the house  so don't even trip 
We're bustin' funky compositions as smooth as a prism 
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm 
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook brrrrrring 
And AMG is puttin' down girl rhymes in his notebook 
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack brrrrrring 
I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?) 
He said he's comin' down at about two on the dot 
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot 
And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin' 
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken 
My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy 
Yo open up the door, they think I'm Freak Man in a Caddy 
Now Freaky's in an El doggin shabbies in at Alco 
And everybody's sippin' on a quart (here we go) 
D just came with a forty and a quart 
In addition to the three that Greedy just brought 
But I don't want to start early, so I just might 
put my forty in the freezer 'cause I want to get bent tonight 
Tonight's the night (yeah) tonight 
Tonight is the night tonight 
Tonight's the night (yo when we gon get bent) tonight 
Tonight is the night (aww yeah) 
And now I'm out of the tub up in a fancy freak 
Spray on some serious and put on my Girbaud jeans 
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim 
And it's a medium, fit me proper cause I'm nice and slim 
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin' 
And I am steadily thinkin' about the 8 that I'll be drinkin' 
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful 
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful 
Ham is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil 
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil 
Freakie lit it up and hit it one two three 
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me 
It's the bomb! 
Yo I can feel my senses Get numb!
Yo fuck the forty ounce I need some rum!
I'm chillin' like a villain Here I come!
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty 
Proper Friday evening and I'm ready to party 
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps 
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps 
(Yo what they in fo') A fin or a half 
(Yo shoot that ten nigga) Don't make me laugh 
Hi-see want a dove and he think that shit is funny 
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin' niggaz money tonight 
Tonight's the night (yeah watch me fuck the hoe) tonight 
Tonight is the night (passin' naturals on motherfuckers) tonight 
Tonight's the night (yo, I'm unfadable) tonight 
Tonight is the night (ahh let's break it down, so I can get funky) 
tonight 
Ah yeah 
Givin' em somethin' they can roll on, hold on 
Wake up Saturday morning and I got a headache 
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank 
last night Soon as I felt it comin' on 
I should quit, it's true that a drunk ain't shit 
To the man up above, the whole thanks I give

grab my blunt and pull my dick up out this bitch mouth
I'm feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something
Multitasking, cooking breakfast, making a nigga wanna (smack that ass)
See, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said ""If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive.""
'Cause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't
I'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam
They had the bomb, and if her baby daddy tripping fuck that nigga
I push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron
make a nigga disappear like J-Kwon
Body found by the Swans, nigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing
I'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if
he do or don't die, he ain't never coming back
Now it's one, two, buckle my shoe
Padded leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do

With The Game, its a goddamn shame niggas can't see that we to blame
For putting Compton to flames, ignite it up
Haters knotted up, when you trip, with canker sores in your whip
That's what I do, to protect my party
My goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy, then its back to shawty
All the ladies drink free, all the players grab a tab
That's how that's supposed to be, drinking Casamigos
Fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now, she so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fires the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first here

Now DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay
Say she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize
You ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?
And had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?
Treat my dick a newborn, hold the head
I told a bitch ""Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared
So stop that bickering,"" I got a bitch from the
Nickersons that got a fucking bounty on my head, uh ho

I'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs
And when I get there baby work your lips
If it don't make Dollars don't holler
It's DJ Quik in any year Impala
And if it don't make Sense then don't flinch
What you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass? No shit

DJ Quik,"[ verse 1 ]
Pass me the... (8 ball) so I can get fucked up
My name is dj quik, so yo, what's up?
Cause I'm the baddest, I feel, gettin ill for real
With a forty of o.e., yo, you know the deal
I'm just chillin with a forty in hand
I'm so damn bent, that I can hardly stand
The bottle's in my face, and my lips are all around it
So stand to the side and watch me (down it)
Take it to the head without feeling no guilt
If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with me when I'm on tilt
Cause I'm a funky dope brother who just won't stop
And I like to drink the 8, cause it's good till the last drop
If I can't get it, then I get the discouraged
I gotta get a bottle of that liquid courage
I take a big gulp, and my head starts zoomin
But I'm feeling good as hell, so let the bass keep boomin
I'm dj quik, and the shots I'm callin
But the posse don't mind, cause we all 8-ballin

(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(drink it like a madman, yes I do)
Pass me the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(40 ounce in my lap, and it's freezin my balls)
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(that vodka I was drinkin said, ""dude, go 'head"")

[ verse 2 ]
Now a forty only cost about $1.95
So we finna mob 17 to the liquor store
And get a case, fuck a six-pack, what's that?
I don't drink no st. ides, so forget that
Now one nigga said that bull got pull
Just drink a quart of o.e. and your ass'll be full
And if you don't think o.e. be workin
Then fuck it, bust the irkin and jerkin
Cause I'm a muthafucka that think when I wanna drink
And how can I tell that you're drunk? cause your breath stink
I know you know you need some double-mint
And you can't mack to a bitch when you're too bent
So take it from me, the homie dj quik
You better rush your cooler, cause you might be sick
Cause the 8 is for the true niggas, and the grown-ups
But that don't matter, cause quik got it sowed up
And punk muthafuckas wanna squab and all that
But we can get em up as soon as you pass the...
(8 ball)

(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)
(take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 ball)
(here we go)
(ah yeah)

Pass me the

(fuck it up, y'all)
(and here comes the...)
(8 ball rollin)
(it'll have you trippin)
(party)
(cause I was drunk)
(ah yeah)

Right about now I'm wonderin who else gone off that 8 ball besides myself
You know all the homies goin off of it
And I know
The l.a. posse's goin off of that (8 ball)
And g wayne goin off of that (8 ball)
And donzelli goin off of that (8 ball)
My homie shot is goin off of that (8 ball)
And playa hamm goin off of that (8 ball)
And shabby blue goin off of that (8 ball)
And mike p goin off of that (8 ball)
And n.o.e. is goin off of that (8 ball)
And little shawn goin off of that (8 ball)
And big duck goin off of that (8 ball)

And lou balls goin off of that (8 ball)

DJ Quik,"Now in my lyrics I kick this shit that the critics debate to
But I still create the shit that the brothers relate to
'Cause it's simple, but I'm no simp, I'm lettin you have it
To the temple leavin a scar MUCH bigger than a, pimple
You want the rubber from a gangsta boot to your grill?
Come take a ride with me and witness the thrill
Of an ass-whuppin, issued by the brothers in the khaki pants
Some think I'm too light to fight, so then they'll win but I grin
When I sail to your motherfuckin chin (MMM)
So suckers keep walkin until the po-po is talkin
In plain simple Englishno wait in plain simple slang, no jivin

Fuckin with me is more lethal than drinkin and drivin
Or try to figure the flow I deliver
Punk it makes you shiver when you think I'm takin two to your liver
The D-to-the-E-to-the-motherfuckin-A with a vengeance
A side of Quik that you ain't never experiencin
I'm stutter steppin with crap on the low and I flow well
Intensifyin with every line, cause I show and tell
My backup is backin, never leavin me lackin
With Double or Nothin, KK, D, and AMG and we're stackin
Up sales for motherfuckers just like you
(For a punk motherfucker with a punk motherfuckin crew!)
Yo I know you peeped that you just can't creep
It's too steep so take a leap because we roll too motherfuckin deep

""(How deep?) Deeper than Atlantis""
""Niggaz can deal with that shit""
So I'm rollin DEEP deep
""Deeper than Atlantis""
""Man that's bad "" "" naw that's good!""

You see we rollin deep, cause a nigga playin the backseat
We won't get beat, so run up and get sweeped
By a young motherfuckin ass nut
We whup your ass and make your momma feel it
And watch you just fold up
It's Tha D in the back with the strap
Down for some shit with a bitch in my lap
Punk motherfuckers like to play the brave role
But I don't give a fuck, you can still get T-rolled
It ain't like you never been checked befo'
You stupid nigga, your bitch, your hoe
The motherfuckers rollin the back streets
Not givin a fuck, because we roll too motherfuckin deep

""(How deep?)""

Deeper than the crack in your momma's cock
Too deep for a nigga, now I can't stop
'Cause niggaz'll roll deep, deep in the middle of the street
So deep we roll onto next week
Two's and fo's, that nigga K throws heavy blows
Heavy enough to knock the snot out of niggaz nose
'Cause niggaz ain't nothin but head and shoulders
Nigga, we should be rollin this
And I'm a roll, cause I'm doin my own thing
(Yeah, motherfuck a posse, we roll with a gang, niggaz)
For those who wanna sleep, time to creep
Straight up fools, cause niggaz is rollin deep

""(How deep?) Deeper than Atlantis""
""Niggaz can deal with that shit""
So I'm rollin DEEP deep
""Deeper than Atlantis""
""Man that's bad "" "" naw that's good!""

Fuck a one-time jack, I eenie meenie miney wet the hoes
Back in the alley I be rollin on the pimpin mode
Unfadeable, cause I'm D-double-E-P
AMG be catchin niggaz slippin constantly
And hoes wanna hoe, with a nigga-role like so
And after I trick, yo see you later bitch
And niggaz think they know what they talkin bout, whatchu sayin?
It was your bitch, that I was fuckin layin and playin
So, if she was fine don't be denyin that I did her
Trust your data nigga, and let my dick get with her
Because another motherfuckin gangster's strollin yo
In the 9-0, nigga-role, this is how I'm rollin

DJ Quik,"One day I was chillin' on Araabie and spruce
Forty in my hand and it's time to get loose
Got my Nikes, Fila t-shirt, and black khakis
I heard a horn blowin' and I jumped in my jacket
John was chillin' in the passenger seat
Stepped up out the car and started dancing in the street
Now John was lookin' fresh and it wasn't no joke
He had on some fresh khakis and was sportin' some Locs
Some gangstas poppin' wheelies came up from behind
He got off throwin' up his favorite gang sign

Here come Little Snub, from the Maple block
Groovin' on the handlebars, ready to rock
And now my posse's gettin' bigger, 'cause of all these niggas
I got the .38 and I'm about to pull the trigger
Looked up at the corner and who did I see?
Wayne and his little man Pop and Nookie
Now Sha came rollin' up on a little scooter
Lookin' for a match so he could light the Thai huddha
I told him I didn't have it, but yet I went to grab it
I lit it up and hit it up, and now I'm draggin' it

Wayne took a hit, Pop took a puff
Nookie started chokin' and now he's fucked up
The forty-ounce is hittin', so I busted into school
I'm never gettin' sweated 'cause I'm just too cool fool
Sun's goin' down and now it's night
My posse's cold chillin' and we're feelin' alright
We heard a lot of noise and it sounded like a rally
Boomin' ass sounds comin' out of Sherm Alley
We all jumped up and we started to stroll
A young nigga like the Quiksta was takin' control

The D.E.A. posse so deep we walked three twos
Now if you want to join then you gotta pay ya dues
We got up to the alley and everything was chill
They was just makin' that dollar dollar bill
Reesa came down and she sat on the stairs
I stood up 'cause I didn't have a chair
Now Pop said, ""Yo! Let's get some cuts
Get that Old 8 so we can get fucked up""
Now I'll put a twenty H put a 10 
And said, ""Fuck it! Super soca and gin""

Now everybody's gettin' in the twilight zone
Head up stairs and they're gettin' weirdo
Gangsta's on the steps and he's tryin' to bang
No belt in his khakis so his Lee's could sag
Here comes Stick with a twenty dollar bag
But he can't roll a joint 'cause he ain't got no zigzags
I looked up at my watch, it said 10:28
You better run up to the liquor store before it's too late
He went to the store and he got the zags
He came back walkin' with my homeboy Cash
Sucka came over he was lookin' for a ride

Runnin' from the police, he ain't have no place to hide
A smile came on my face when I swallowed my beer
I'm chillin' like a villain and I got no fear
Now Tony Lane came he said he was bored
Eatin' on some chips that he got from the store
I said I'm bored too, so what's up with that?
Wayne said ""Is anyone down to jack?""
Now I can get the AK and you can get the pump
But I don't want no deuce-deuce, 'cause I ain't no chump
Now Mike said, ""Dane which one do you choose?""

""I could take the .38 and you can have the Uze""
But before we can jet and be on our way
Some niggas rolled up and they was ready to spray
Rollin' real slow, they turned off the lights
Waitin' until the time was right
A fool jumped out all dressed in Guess?
(Yeah) shot him in the chest
The niggas tried to jet, but the couldn't get far
'cause Mike had the uzi and he aimed it for the car

Ha Ha 
Now that's how it's done and we do it good
Just another day in my loked out hood
Now all y'all remember that we can't be stopped

Bout how a nigga can't keep from gettin jacked

You gotta hold your own at any cost
'Cause if you don't boy you might get bossed and tossed
By a sucker who claims he got more game than you
Bein' true is what you oughta do

Or you just might find some chrome pointed at your dome
Think fast or you might not make it home
See a nigga like myself ain't goin out like that

'Cause I'm a playa motherfucker named DJ Quik
Yo, maybe it's the way, I hold my dick

That makes all the girlies want to ride my tip

Cause all I have to do is hop back and spit
And watch all the lil' mommas start havin fits
When I slide through the city in my Escalade
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, cause we extra paid
Tryin to stay sharp as a razor blade
And you thinkin 'bout now that we got it made
And I'ma take you right down, that ain't the case

Chasin pay, smash if you in my way
With 3 dimes and I'm lookin for a place to lay

And tryin to spend the rest of my life with the right team (who that?)

I'm going down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be having a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doing nothing but (claiming my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doubling up and proving to suckers that I can throw
I'm passing a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely free styling, all the while still profiling
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm living
I do as I please, you see

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, motherfucker silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're ducking, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is taking over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm coming like this, and I'm coming directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doing damage quite effectively
Rhyming is a battle zone, and suckers have no win
Cause I'm a veteran from the see-o-m-p-t-o-n
Kick it

From Denver to Phoenix and even St. Louis
Everywhere we went, fools tried to do us
And to the suckaz thinkin' that a nigga wouldn't steal
How your jaw feel, and is your nose healed?

Somewhere along the line they musta heard the rumor
Of my underground days mixed with bangin and humor
And when I got on stage, they all jumped in my way
Shoutin', ""what up 'cause?"" just to see what I'd say

But I ain't trippin, just checkin' a grip
I ain't crippin' or even ruinin' blood'n, just smokin a bud'n
Gettin' bent, so if you want to see me throw a full fit
Then come up in my face with that bullshit",No Bullshit,1992
DJ Quik,"Sometimes I just don't even understand why people
Like this dirty talkin' shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
But since they do an' people buyin' this shit
I'ma kick it like this

You see a pimpin' ass nigga like me, is wanted dead or alive
Because I jack these hooker hoes for they ten's an' they five's
An' twenty's then I leave 'em branded 'cause I'm the love bandit
I'm not tryin' to be mean, I want your green or you'll be stranded

'Cause you know it don't pay to play for free, yo
So you shit out of luck, I need a buck to fuck
You duck, hoe, bitch, tramp
An' I don't take no food stamps

This is a reminder, I'm lettin' you know that if I get behind ya
You're gonna have to kick up or eat a dick up 'til you hiccup
I treat yo' ass as if this was a stick up
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a pick-up

Trick, hell, yeah, I'm offensive
A spin around the bend can be expensive
An' the effects'll be, they can be extensive
So if I gotta fuckin' take a chance, I want my grip in advance

Oh, yeah, I'm a hoe, what you think I gave you the dick fo'?
See, I can play the bitch but see I ain't the bitch
You better checkin' her in an' better do it quick

See, the Devil made me do it 'cause the devil was you
'Cause I done seen all the shit you took niggaz through
But not me, wench, you cute saditty skanch
Think I'ma be the trick nigga? Well, bitch, I ain't

'Cause I'm the type of nigga that can get you cocked
Without payin' you but straight be playin' you
Bitch, I thought you knew better than that
See, it only fucks you up when your weak game lacks

Manipulatin' moves like I do
See, it just goes to show you, hoe, you can't play a true

I find a stupid hoe an' talk her ass to matrimony
Now I can be cool until we hitched
But I'ma switch up on my role an' play the motherfuckin' bitch

Waitin' for the mailman to come around
Oh, you'se a low-down nigga, naw, man, I'm just a money hound
I play the roll well, check out my limp

Yo' check is short, I ain't gon' sweat, huh

DJ Quik,"[DJ Quik]
Oh yes I'm new and improved, and to a funky-ass groove
My name is Quik and I'm smooth, and I'm making yo' ugly bitch move
With the streets you can't lose, but if you still want to choose
To be a sucker, I got a 380 punk, so duck her
And to you motherfuckers thinking you want to fade me?
I'm running the underground, so fool, you're crazy
And you better step, 'fore I beat you with a switch
And tie you up, and make you watch, while I'm fucking yo' bitch
Cause I'm a low-pro nigga that you should not fol-low
Putting suckers in the wind cause my voice is hollow
Put the pistol to your grill and your punk ass rolls
You grab my shit and I pull the trigger now you're missing a nose
And umm, I don't fear your crew because my back is got
Chasing nothing but the suckers when we hit yo' spot
Yeah, straight Bronx killer, mark ass niggas can't check me
But gotta respect me, cause I'm Way 2 Fonky

[Chorus]
Fonky, yeah, fonky, ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky, yeah, fonky, ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky, yeah, fonky, ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky, yeah, fonky, yeah

[DJ Quik]
Now no sooner than I hit the fucking streets
People be approaching me, all throughout the swap meets
Asking me shit like, ""When your new album coming out?""
""Is it different?"" ""Is it dope?"" ""Where yo' perm?""
What you talking bout?
I know you don't expect that a nigga gon' quit
Being nothing less than funky and banging out the dope-ass hits
Cause DJ Quik is a name that I take much much pride in
No egoes to hide in and no limos to ride in
Maybe a Cutlass or two, but still the same ol' shit
And me unclever? No never, I'll have this talent forever
The producer get funky down to the last ounce
And I'm creative too, so I don't need ""Mo' Bounce""
But to you suckers in my city claiming I got a ""Def Wish""
You should try again fool, you ain't hitting near this
Them wack ass tracks, make you sound like a monkey
Just a shot in the dark, from a punk-ass mark who ain't Fonky

[Chorus]

[DJ Quik]
Now when you records ain't that funky then it's easy to disrespect this
Cause you know that when I hit I didn't miss
Just like that ""I'm Born and Raised,"" you wish you could fade
And when you picked up that album cover you knew I was paid, Tim
Cause we ain't going out and we ain't stuck in that old school shit
That boring flavor that just don't hit
Cause this is ninety-two, and yes yo' style is through
And if your record ain't selling well fool I thought you knew
That this is straight Bronx killer, straight Bronx murder
Yeah yo' city's a dump, and fool yo' shit don't bump
And 'member the ""Jack the Rapper""? Yeah, your punk ass sat
That's when my homeboy D, was bout to flatten yo' cap
And you apologized to him, started kissing his ass
Saying you only dissed Compton for the money, so he gave you a pass
But you ain't moving shit on the streets
Get off the nuts of my city with them wack ass beats that ain't Fonky

[Chorus]",Way 2 Fonky,1992
DJ Quik,"When you a G, niggaz wanna be like you
Because a G has images what they look up to
But some don't make it, so they takin' the funk
They get hot and they be poppin' that gangsta junk

But that ain't G, that ain't even close, nah that ain't shit
It ain't about who can bang or slang the most 'caine
And ki's or O's, sport new clothes
Or about who can fuck the most hoes

'Cause it's a mind state, it's playin' it's manipulatin'
It's winnin' from the freakin' and maneuverin' and then captivatin'
Livin' the life that make the bitches wanna fiend and dream
And all the jealous niggaz mean and scheme

And weak minor suckaz they wanna show they ass
But a nigga like Quik'll check 'em real fast
They don't know the real and so they quick to assume
That's why they shut up when I enter the room 'cause I'm a G

Playin' tough
But them niggaz ain't really rough
Creampuffs is a better word than tough

When you a G, attention is yours
When you demonstrate power
And game the untrues imitate
They get frustrated, they sock girls and slam doors
But when you're a G you just check yours

Takin' up the slack, all the way around
And then my back got yours, then we ain't goin' down
Like Playa Hamm said, it's the thing that I pray for
And play for, that I slay for

'Cause I'm the G when it comes to a funky track
I'm the G when it comes to the whole sack
I'm the G when it comes to decision makin'
I'm the G that got all these niggaz blinkin'

I'm the G that's young and intimidatin'
I'm the G never sprung got the bitches waitin'
I'm the G suckaz fear because I'm strong
And I'm the G, never standin' alone

Fadin' 'em, left to right, front back to center
I'm a natural born winner
I got connects on a quest to be true
So I won't teach you what I know
I'ma teach you what you know, yo

My game is tight so if you're lookin' and listenin' and learnin'
Apply it to yours and you'll earn respect in abundance
And you can never be checked see
When you're a motherfuckin' G

y'all better get hip
And come off this trip
Wit'cho [Unverified] killin' asses

The G-ness, when you a G it's the description
The suckaz are fearin' it
'Cause in the mack they keep on hearin' it
They wish they could neglect it
But they can't so they disrespect it

And when they run up, yeah they get chin checked
When you a G, backs to backs never duckin'
Suckaz freakin' yo' bitches though, dismissin' the hoes
Before a bigga nigga, when you a G you're the teacher
Any other way that I coulda come just might not reach ya

The G-ness, such as my gangsta mentality
The G-ness, such is the greatness of my pals and me
Destiny's testin', trueness of character
Since I'm a G, fuck with my brothers that fucks with me

Come to the Penthouse if you want if you aren't true
And journey through the mind of a G since he ain't you
It ain't just the mack or the sack or the strong back
It ain't just the plain simple fact we got all that

It ain't just the dead weight, that we droppin' daily
Crews I don't forget, 'cause my memory don't fail me
Those that know, know I know that they do
Those who are wondering?

(Motherfuck you)
I only owe to P.P.C. a chosen few
I got players all around me, doin' what they want to
The rise of the wise got suckaz droppin' like flies
When you a G nigga, peepin' the prize from these eyes

DJ Quik,"Finally out the motherfuckin see-p-t
Off to other cities and shit
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs... a local nigga made good
And made a name off of making tapes for niggaz in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that i been to and the shit that i been through
Like fightin and shootouts and bangin and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it
Nineteen-ninety-one, it was double or nothin that a nigga would hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggaz and gettin drunken off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was i to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And that they didn't like this
That compton was the home of a foot in yo ass
Where you got blast
And now that's just a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in oak-land
And niggaz was kickin up sand, to them bangin ain't nothin new
And slangin ain't nothin new
And for every nigga we done shot
They done shot two
Straight through and on since the sixties before i was born
Families of young niggaz mourn
So i'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay
Keep your hand on the clip
Becaue oakland... 
Yeah, i'm telling why'all oakland... 
Moving on to st. louis, where thecountry is fucked
With gold teeth int hey mouth, but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a motherfucker
Hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why i kept my ass on the bus
But later on, whenit cooled off we came down
And met a couple of friends
Who put us up on the st. louis cap
The smith center, with big bob, little steve, tojo, biss and rich
And a couple of bitches
Then they took us to a man named gus in a store
He put me down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when i started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
'cause later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, bloods and crips start scrappin and shootin -- in missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?
Now st. louis... 
Yeah why'all, st. louis... 
I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin that ""colors"" and ""boyz in the hood""
Too busy claimin sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the shaw
But now, back to the story that i'm tellin
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin
When we arrived i saw red and blue sweatsuits
When i'm thinkin bout horse dookey and cowboy boots
I guess texas ain't no different from the rest
And san antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test
And before it was over the shit got deep
A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin of scrappin
Little did they know that we was packin
Yeah, we was puttin em down and squaring the rest, shit
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest
Now san antonio... 
Yeah, san antonio... 
After a month on the road
We came home and i can safely say
That l.a. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of niggaz in a town like this
Have such a big influence on niggaz so far away?
But still my story ain't over 'cause i got one more to tell
And the people of colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show i did in denver
With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink
Bitches was loving it, but niggaz was shovin and shit
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But i'm getting paid so i didn't pay it no mind
Then i poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my guests
When it was over two niggaz needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches
Now denver... 
Yeah why'all, denver... 
And ya know that oakland... 
Yeah why'all st. louis... 
Uh-huh, san antonio... 
Yeah, and denver... 
I thought ya knew...",Jus Lyke Compton,1994

Telling my homies be careful o' the things that you do
Cuz I went out, assed out
I shoulda never tripped and put my lips in between hips
But I used to eat that thang that didn't sit on a plate
Didn't taste like stank I up and left about 8
But I had to build her make for the fact that I was young
I was showing to prove the hoochies I could work they pearl tounge
But then game got kilt
Cuz the girl kept pushin' my head all up under the quilt
And I was like damn, you must be sick
You mean you'd rather have a tongue
instead of a pair o' nuts and a stick (You goddamn right)
And every single night, I lick it till my tounge turn white
I thought I was a freak till I heard my homies brag
(Eating that coochie make you grow a mustache)Ya!
So I took that advice and right before I hit it
I took baby monkey lift it up and I bit it
Yeah homeboy I had the coochie in check
But then I got this real bad cramp in my neck

Not in here and fuck cuz all coochie got a taste to it
See I don't know who been digging you out
And licking ya down
I aint the first girl so I can't clown
But instead Im'a tell you how its done
You gotta tell a ho 68 and I owe you 1
Cuz if you don't then she'll play you like a sucka
Have you lickin on a lollipop......{dumb motherf.....}Ya
But it aint no trippin on mine {Why is that?}
Cuz tounge condoms are hard to find {Yeeeah}
And even if ya dicks protected
You can still catch the high by doing a nose dive
So be cautious and don't be anxious
Even though you never could now you wanna catch ST-Statures
(Now you wanna catch ST-Statures)
But niggas still put they nuts in a frier
Then they get burnt and they wanna fight fire with fire

DJ Quik,"Baby baby  baby  baby  baby 
Who taught you how to do this shit? 
Yeah  you bad than a motherfucker 

Tell me  why are you so curious 
And why you keep on starin' 
At the motherfuckin' zipper on these jeans 
That I'm wearin' cause baby what's in there 
Is beyond your wildest dreams 
And although it seems that I'm on the nigga hoe team 
Girl  listen  listen  Mary don't you weep 
I don't come cheap and I'm not just no nigga off the street 
I'm a certified specialized pro 
Who's got a lot of soul when you're swingin' 
Off the end of my pole 
But the matter at hand is the size 
And how it makes ya act 
When you get it up and in between your thighs 
You could squirm and squeal and try to make a deal 
That'll keep me on your jock 
For whenever you get that feelin' for the real 
And when it gets swollen 
You think you'll be controllin' me 
Because I put the pole in your hole, see 
But however it's done, it's 68 and I owe you 1 
I'm doin' it for the thrill of it 
So tell me can you feel it? 

Itz your fantasy baby, tell me if you feel it 
You know you want to feel it 
Itz your fantasy, sing it if you feel it 

Okay, let's find a place, somethin' out of dodge 
Like the Quality Inn or the Travelodge 
Since I'm goin' out of my way 
Baby you pay for the spot 
See it's only right since you gettin' the cock 
Now tell me who's gonna get the rubbers? 
First things first, yes I like a bitch 
Who carries Lifestyles in her purse 
So since you know the play 
Close the curtains all the way 
And get ready for a toss and some rib sauce 
With a little weed I could do a good deed 
And as long as you ain't bleedin' 
I can give you what you need 
But I got a little ritual before we make love 
You gotta dish-a-dish-a-scrub 
Wash-a-wash-a-wash-a-rinse in the bathtub 
Hennessy and apple juice to sip on 
Get a little buzzed and we can get our dig on 
So don't trip cause when you 
Takin' off your clothes to reveal it 
I'm a make you feel it 

Sing it if ya feel it, it's your fantasy baby 
Touch me if ya feel it, I need to know if you feel it 
Can you feel it baby? 

Now put it where you want it, get in where you fit in 
Cause when it comes to hittin' it, splittin' it 
I ain't bullshittin' 
See, you look so good you make me want to go bare back on ya 
But I ain't hittin' unless I use the whole pack on ya 
Bitch didn't ya know I have more stamina than a horse? 
So don't trip just let the Hen take it's course 
Yeah right now your frontin', 
Shy, actin' like you nervous, naw, turnaround, lay down 
And let me pound on your cervix 
Yeah, it's the Log Ride, like at Magic Mountain 
Take it out your mouth and shoot it like a fountain 
Pull and watch it explode 
Let me change my tire and I'm right back on the road 
Now is this more than you expected? 
You let me drive that coochie and I wrecked it 
So even though I'll never get another chance to kill it 
It's cool just as long as I made you feel it 

Itz your fantasy, tell me if you feel it 
You know you love it, sing it if you feel it 
You make me feel it, I know you feel it 
You know you feel it, tell me if you feel it 
Sing it if you feel it 
Yeah, you feel it, I love to make you feel it 
Oh, you feel it",Itz Your Fantasy,1995

DJ Quik,"Guess who motherfuckers? 
I don't give a fuck  my attitude is Gotti, yeah 
And I'm hard to love 'cause I don't love nobody, Hell nah 
All I give a fuck about is music and sex
A fifth of Remi Martin and some big fat checks

Yeah! Ha ha ha
Back up in this motherfucker for the n fin 
And this one is dedicated  to the West side of the Tree 
Four hundred block  you know what I'm sayin'? 
And this is still Eight Killa 
And fuck all his old scary ass homeboys too 
Yeah 
Nineteen ninety-one 
Just when all these other rappers seem to be fallin' by the wayside 
We put a team together and came out with some of that ol' funky shit 
But during the course of then and now 
Some of my homeboys went Hollywood, now I ain't gon' say no names 
But they know who the fuck I'm talkin' to 
And it's all to the good, 'cause this is still P-Funk on mine, huh 

Street level, street level, street level

DJ Quik,"[Quik] 
Hamm, what's up, nigga!

[Hamm] 
What's up, my brother
Just loungin, you know
Bout to crack this 40 ounce

[Quik] 
Oh, look at you, lil' ol' alcoholic-ass nigga

[Hamm] 
Well, you know I got to have it, my brother, ain't nothing changed
You want to hit it?

[Quik] 
Yeah, what's up?

[Hamm] 
Hey man, you tell ME
What's up with the album, man?

[Quik] 
Hey man, we tryin' finish that motherfucker, man 
And eh, I need one more song

[Hamm] 
No shit

[Quik] 
Yeah, I wanted to know if you wanted to bust on it?

[Hamm] 
Oh, without a doubt, you know I'd love to

[Quik] 
'member that shit you was busting for me over the phone
That sucka-free shit?

[Hamm] 
Yeah, I remember that shit

[Quik]
Well, won't you put that shit right about
Here!

(Sucka)
(Sucka)
(Sucka)
(Ha?)
(Now a sucker raises up off of you)
Did you miss me?
It took a little time to get sucka-free
But since a young g it's PPC 
Ain't no shame in the name
And still true to the game
Still serving suckers, just the same
No sense, and dwelling in the past tense
I roll with Quik, so you better check your ladies, gents
Cause I'ma teach her how to break you, right before I break her
After I make her, then I shake her
Yeah, I know, you heard it all before
But I can't deal, cause I see you're still simping for a hoe
Claiming pimp, but you're paying for the pu'
Silly sucker, punk motherfucker
They only flock and jock
Cause you're filling up they pocketbooks
And you're still judging bitches by they looks
When it's really all about what she can do for you
I do for me and still see a True
Ah-ha, really? Do you hear me, bro?
Got your name all on your lips, but your chick trips
Oh no, never will I lower to your level
And I got 17 for ya, devil
Too True to ever let a sucker like you 
Make me do something that I don't want to do
I'm still real with it, you got's to deal with it
I serve that ass like a clocker, I don't give a fuck
But who you're doing, how you're doing
Or what you do it with
You better miss me with the dumb shit
So when you're speaking on the Playa Hamm or my nigga Quik
Everybody knows you're sucking on a fat dick
It ain't nothing to nothing in your ass, so that you see clear
Booming in your ear, so I know you hear
Bump this in your Coupe with your R&B want to-be-me
Trick-ass, I'm sucka-free",Sucka Free,1995
DJ Quik,"Now even though I was only a young buck I was still trying to kick it.
Having a gang of fun, and much too young to be wicked.
'Cause when I was thirteen you know we didn't have cars.
It was either double ride the peg nuts, or hop on the handle bars.
And then we went and bought a gang of balloons and had
A water balloon fight that lasted until the night.
Then after that we played some ""hide and go get it""
With the neighborhood homegirls dumb enough to be with it.
All in fun and games and keeping it cool,
But my, my, when you're kicking it, time flys by;
'Cause every hour's a minute, and every minute's a sec.
And if I'd came home late my moms would ring my neck, yeah,
But I regret not the whoopings I got.
'Cause to be able to play the next day was okay.
On a mission, to hit up the neighbor's fruit trees;
Just a bunch of kids chillin', enjoying the summer breeze.

[Chorus]
Summer breeze, flowing like the wind;
Boy, you need to know that you got a friend.
It'll always be me; (I'll always be here.)
It'll always be me; (I'll always be here.)
It'll always be me; (I'll always be here.)

Now I'm growing some fuzz; getting older - like seventeen, eighteen,
And the only thing I know is to stay clean.
T-shirt, short pants, Nikes on spotless.
I was even old enough to buy me a Cutlass;
A little vehicle to ride around town, play with the hos, and
Roll down the window and mack to the one who's chosen.
Yo, them biker pants is looking kinda right on you.
My name is DJ Quik, and my homies is having a barbeque.
Before I finish my whole sentence complete,
She was off the bus stop and in my passenger seat.
And we was sliding to the Westside, stopped at the store
To get some farm; 'cause that make 'em kick it a little more.
And at the spot, you know that chicken was kicking.
The pig on the grill, and, so, the day was chill,
But that night my girl was tipsy and ready to skeeze,
But I didn't even trip; too busy jocking the summer breeze.

[Chorus]

Now I'm twenty-three, and I remember the times when
We was chillin' like villians and didn't have no nines.
Like when we used to mob to beaches to kick it and swim.
Now I hang around and watch the tides come in,
And I'm thinking how many funerals I've been to.
Watching all my homies get buried in them boxes they put 'em into.
And then I read a letter from upstate, from my homie G-Wayne,
Who's been locked up since '87, '88.
And it really ain't nothing fly about it,
So he go: ""I'm a stay strong, or I'm a break down and simply cry about it.""
And when it seem like things just ain't gon' be right
I gotta thank my creator for letting me sleep last night.
And wake me up in the morn 'cause I shutter to think
That could be me dead, or locked away in the clink,
So I'm lifting my homie's spirits as tall as the trees,
And I can even hear him calling me, in the summer breeze.

[Chorus]",Summer Breeze,1995
DJ Quik,"Yeah, welcome to Club Hub City

Yo a day in the life of a player named Quik 
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick 
And just because I drink the 8  they say that I'm hopeless 
But I don't give a fuck  so blame it on the loc est 
Now this is how we do it when we checkin' a grip 
Teddy Bear's in the house  so don't even trip 
We're bustin' funky compositions as smooth as a prism 
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm 
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook brrrrrring 
And AMG is puttin' down girl rhymes in his notebook 
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack brrrrrring 
I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?) 
He said he's comin' down at about two on the dot 
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot 
And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin'

Spray on some serious and put on my Girbaud jeans 
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim 
And it's a medium, fit me proper cause I'm nice and slim 
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin' 
And I am steadily thinkin' about the 8 that I'll be drinkin' 
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful 
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful 
Ham is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil 
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil 
Freakie lit it up and hit it one two three 
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me 
It's the bomb! 
Yo I can feel my senses Get numb!
Yo fuck the forty ounce I need some rum!

I should quit, it's true that a drunk ain't shit 
To the man up above, the whole thanks I give 
I'll never drink again if you just let me live 
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it 
Call it Earl like a mother while I'm grippin' the toilet 
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin' 
Round and round I think I better sit down 
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint 
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't 
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door

But life in a brick now, now, knew her, huh, huh, bullshit she
Took her stinky ass, come up to my parole officer and say he hit me
He'll do a violation, and she know west [Incomprehensible]
To realize only reason, that bitch work is to keep her ankles warm

I, pimpin' a padron on the first degree
I'm writin' letters to a bitch that ain't thinkin' 'bout me
But I'm a pimp, mayne, so I'ma sharpen up my twos and 'bout that
'Cause that bitch lips so big
Chopstick had to invent a spray,so, hey, fuck that

You know that player hater, he ain't got one pinball in his body
That's funny, I, I can't, can't wait, wait to, to get, get my, my money
In a real way, hey, Mr. pimp player, max superior
Drivin' that pussy in a pink Cadillac

With some of that jack, off nut colored interior

Tryna get whatcha on me, nothin' mo, nothin' less

'Cause in my black Lex, I rolls from county to county
City to city, lookin' for the dark honies, suckle brown red titties
And bitches, y'all can't play a technique for a trick
Because I speaks softly and carries a big ol' dick

And um, I like the bitches that ain't scared to use they hands
I like the bitches that'd get naked in the back of the van
Yeah, see, see, I paid ya like I'm major
You bitches steadily gettin' over them, niggas, that done paid ya

But then I just fire my Newport and look at ya stupid
And then shoot you with an arrow like dick 'cause I ain't Cupid
Now, learn to tip toe ?

Hold on, here we come

Tip Toe, but don't ya run, 'cause me and my dogs be chillin' in the tree
DJ Quik, Blac Tone and Suga Free
Now, tell me what ya want, baby, what ya need?

I slap meat to a freak and make the ho, nose bleed
'Cause bitches like you smoke up all the weed
And ain't givin up shit with yo nappy weed

See I a hoe, like you can shake my spot
Or suck my dick, till your taste of snot
Naw, it don't stop, we stays on top
And bust like a muthafuckin' fo, fo shot

Fuck what you got, I'ma ride and swerve
Intoxicated, man, I hate it when I scrapes the curb
Just slammed the do and the ho tried to work me

Get covert & infiltrate yo' clique
Crack yo' shit & mack yo' bitch
Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver
Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather
And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her
'cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno-
Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl
Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas
Baby do you really want to play the flute on me?
I'll give you a sack & take it back & you'll die to get it

Now who says we can't be fly? 

Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla 

At the same time get some thigh 

Well uh that's the subject of my conversation 

Cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar & some penetration 

Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days 

But uh some of you playas still be going out sideways 

So umm just take this game with a tic tac 

Cause if you was on Skid Row you can get 

Pussy faster than a Big Mac 

I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy 

Cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy 

Because uhh ""Sometimes they feel like a nut"" 

But they rather have it more often than they don't 

So I won't go flippin' & makin' it topsy turvy 

Now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp & that ass curvy 

Cause ain't nuthin' on my mind but to be fly through time 

Havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine 

Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub 

Eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' & getting a back scrub

Hot bare back until I felt that quake 
She told me shoot that milk shaker shoot that milk shaker 
Goddamn I don't want to get sprung 
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy 
Ran home to tell my nigga Top 
About this cock that just wouldn't stop yeah

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

From the low bottoms to the skies, I got 'em open
On the scrotum they blowin' like it's chronic, high hopin'
The P never leaves, be conceivin' 'em like intercourse
Up in somethin', keep 'em comin', Playa Hamm be the source

Of the force you now witness, and this is just
Another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin', P clique swangin' down the shore

Tricks out here, tryin' to make hits instead of makin it hard hittin'
And perpetratin' frauds when they spittin'
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders, you know

What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin' P's, players, we be the essence
For life, it's the JB and pimpin' Carl
When LTD we havin' it all, no doubt

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what I'm all about

Now I'ma tell ya straight up, one nigga planned on havin' hands on
Messin' with what I stand on, but trick you find to get ate up
I feel like a [Incomprehensible] but this pimp ahead of me
Has [Incomprehensible] to within an inner trace of the mind
Disintegrates her kind like battery acid

You never got no money from a hoe or seen my max
[Incomprehensible] buddy be somethin' broke
I'm a pimp, but you don't know
You better stand up, now empty out your purse I told you
Get out, I don't trust your ass, now throw your hands up

Take it to the bump-bump-be-ba-dump
Dip, give me my chips, witchcraft
Now let me see what I can check you with now

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in your eyes
And tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does

Ho, what, you can't see me with it, why, probably 'cause
I stay G'd up from the street up
And subject to make your trick, go get it

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now run and tell 'em what we all about

No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
No doubt, no doubt, I got somethin' for ya mouth
Now let my man press like some dookie in your mouth

DJ Quik, Hi-C, Tony Lane, stay in somethin'
Playa Hamm, oh, Bubba Brown, Clue Dog, Peter Gunz as well
El DeBarge, what's up, baby?
Ain't nothin' but a party up in here, yeah

Because me game is stil the same

I never rode a pony but I'm genuine 

So give me just a little bit of nicotine 

And a sticky greeen 

And I'm a hit it with the icky cream 

Booyah I hit her on the neck with a whip 

And made the hooker jump without a safety net 

Hit the ground break her back 

Get up and do it again because she can really take a shot on the chin 

caffeine cappucino chase it with some no-doz 

Up all night like the moon glows 

Searching for new hoes 

They really want to follow my lead 

indeed and give a nigga just what I need 



Chorus: 

When I'm on speed 

I'm faster then most 

And I can rock a party from coast to coast 



The Q-you-I-K is the name I spell 

124 beats per minute I rock well 

Because I'm tight to the second power 

When I hit the liquor 

And I don't serve emcees 

I'm serve dickas 

Bang bang boogie 

When I hit a shot of loogie 

And the Booger try to put it on me 

But I get that moves to show her 

I flaunt it like Noah 

I strut backside like a Boa 

Constrictor when I dicked her down 

Game feel just like a circus clown when I work this 

Jack of all trades 

Master to few

Got hookers from Cancoun to Reo 

Fire (?ignite it?) 

But we don't even try it 

You can't but it 

Got freaks have to hide it 

Hit the weed up 

Then turn the speed up 

The booty from the backs the only way I eat up 

Quicker than Jackie Chan 

I search off the Goochi like a rubber band 

You want to be more than the average man 

But the hoe needs more a job in a man 

And a retirement plan 

So baby don't cry the blues 

Cause I know a gang of hoes in your shoes

DJ Quik,"Ha ha nothin but the best from the best 
You feel me? hear me 
This is dedicated to that special someone 
You know who you are and you never gave me a chance 

I used to watch you walk to class fine as can be 
While I'm standing here with K.K. and D 
And I did a liitle bit of everything just to get your attention 
But I knew you had no eyes for me 
I used to get up sharpen my pencil for nothin 
You watch me watch you rollin your eyes and you still was bumpin 
So when test time came I was all in yours 
With no bubbles on my papers just some low ass scores 
I guess you can call it puppy love I was a scrub 
Having fantasies of me and you up in my tub 
Makin love in the soapy water,having my daughter 
But I knew you liked them baller dudes and, I did'nt have a quarter 
I admit on the rainy days it was sad 
Cause it was'nt about who you was but what you had 
Now I'm doing swell baby and you know it's true 
Back when you had a chance you should've let me breath on you 

Sittin in my room thinkin bout you 
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do 
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin 

I'm Sittin in my room thinkin bout you 
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do 
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin 

Now I called you on the telephone baby it's david 
The last you gave a chance is the first to save it 
And I'm just tryin to hook us up for another session 
Because I have'nt learned my lesson 
Plus I got positions never ending 
Now I'm descending down into your valley baby work your tendons 
Doing what I do to make you do what you did 
To make me come so hard that we almost had a kid 
Platinum that's how I descibe your thigh 
Tell me how come your so young doin shit that fly 
You must have came from the school of hard knocks 
Lickin on hard rocks and blowin off tube socks 
Now whenever it's time for fun 
You got me blowin up your pager with 911's ha 
Now show me a little affection 
But hurry up before I lose my erection 

Because I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you 
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do 
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin 

I said I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you 
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do 
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin

And now I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you 
And you baby doll don't even have a clue

Groovin off the spirituality, and it feels good
I got somethin to say though

It's time for somebody to take over the West Coast power with fly style
And I'm the one, been here for years so check your file
Cuz I'm the kinda nigga with a strong desire
To nutt up, light a torch, and set the world on fire!
See me bouncin in my 'Vette, Doin' donuts in the middle of a Reseda
Wit Rosarita, tryin' to find some place to eat her
Cuz I'm freaky with a capital L
I'll beat up that little pocket pita til there ain't nothing left
I'm nasty
See, we gets better when you think we hot
And we got more cheddar than they think we got
Cuz see we make the kinda money that when we withdrawl
They notify the feds cuz it's too much y'all
What you call a stash, we call it petty cash
Spend five or six figures a month ain't left a gash
Party all night, then we sleep all day
Drink Corona X for breakfast then we ready to play
I still like 'em green eyed big ol' titties and thighs
Big ol' nigga, little heart, and I'm big into thighs
So shoot your game baby girl, don't be scared to take a pet
You never know, it just might be wet

We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly

Now whether or not I be drunk off a gallon a Moet
I can still make the beats stink like some salmon croquette
Go to the hood and get all the kids that I can fit
In a limo take 'em to the store and buy 'em some shit
Give 'em a demo of my new shit cuz it's the shit
And let 'em know that they the shit
And they can make hits cuz it ain't shit
I gotta keep the cycle goin, baby doll
Whichever way the wind be blowin', I'm goin'
Higher than a motherfucker, Mr. Dante

Whether it's soft, whether it's bold
Whether it's new, whether it's old
Whether it's GOLD, platinum, I stack 'em

Freestylin' like a motherfucker don't ask why
Cuz this ain't Budweiser

We still party, It get's high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, 'til we die
Cuz life is much too short for you to not be fly

Now can y'all feel that? See, ain't nothing but God mackin' goin' on right
Now, see? Da game is to be told and not sold dependin' on which game it is
And we gon' keep it way real, you know? Cuz' it ain't no doubt in nobody's
Mind that I'm a very blessed individual, there. If we don't turn it around and
Give it back than we can't we can't go forward, it's up to you. That's what we
Do everytime we get on this microphone, we let 'em know that we might be
Street rappers, but we are very much in order, and we got somethin' to say. So
If you feelin' me like we feelin y'all, get yo ass up on the ball. Time to
Take this shit back. All of it. Cuz it was ours to begin with. Don't sleep
Baby. Don't sleep homey. Now when the hook come back again

And it ain't gon' kill you if you give me yo number
What's happenin'? Can we hook up later or something? Thank you

[DJ Quik:]
I like the way that you don't say much
And when the homies give you phone numbers you don't stay in touch
With that proper little mystic about your ways
About your style that got your boy dazed
Now I'm diggin' in my game so I can see where you at
And I'm pushin' all the buttons that make you come exact
I know you recognize I'm young and I'm gifted and black
That should be enough to have you sprung and fidgety in ya cat
But yet you play it off swell
To see if I'ma give up on the pursuit of your tail
But even if you knew that ain't all I wanted was just to bone it
I'm still detectin' ego trippin', baby you own it
But you don't understand I know parts of you that you do not
And I can penetrate right down through your through-through spot
Because I'm talented and young and I got a lot wealth
And I'm the bomb baby, now what you tell me 'bout my self?

Now lay down by my fireplace and drink Sip & Dale
While I massage your feet, and you massage my neck
And I won't make a move on you long as you got self-respect
Now check it, I want to see what you look like in spa
With nothing on yo body but yo panties and bra
Grand Mar in ya flava down your neck and your back
Aha, didn't know the Quiksta could do it like that
You actin' different on the liquor baby girl is that you
The ways your eyes sparkled when I bit yo tattoo
You're rugged but soft baby you're sowed up with fears
And you gotta like pleasure and pain with your naval peers
But I appreciate you lady 'cause you're makin' me wait
Even though that little game you playin' is much outta date
I'ma save it for next time and I hope you will too

You gave him yo love and he blew it
Move, let me do it
Because my love is like fire and ice, I'm like bitter sweet
Me and my peaches, and you and yo pretty feet
Knowin' that if I lick it, tell me then I get closa
While I'm urgin' you to drink this Mamosa
Because you know that I got the skills that make you get them crazy leg spasms
By helping you to reach multiple orgasms
Ya hear me? Now feel me, you know what's happenin'

And I'll be over there twenty minutes to hit it

Just 'cause I kick it with killers don't mean that I do it 

my occupation's a musician & I'm stayin' true to it 

I went from bein' a rider to bein' a provider 

while I was straddlin' the fence tryin' not to hit the divider 

Just an impressionable human being tryin' to do right 

every now & then I get my manhood tested in fights 

like I used to have a beef with this cat named Eiht 

and his homies approached me at the club El Rey 

What was I to do I'm on stage & I'm doin' my thang 

and this nigga's out in the crowd tryin' to hoo' bang 

givin' it up for his homies & set trippin' too 

but he wasn't from Rollin' 60's more like Tragney 

I wonder what's his problem what he tryin' to say 

Is this business personal or just Fuck Quik Day? 

I approached him like a man & not like a nut 

he turned around & put his drink down & straight knuckled up 

In the dark club punches is flyin' all around 

and even though it was me & him the rumors went 'round 

and said I killed somebody now how that sound 

How could I stomp somebody to death that's bigger than me 

and I'm just a hundred & fifty five pounds tell me

See some don't realize the power of lyrics 

'cause when you rap about death you talkin' to spirits 

You see you can say the things that can help us all ball 

or you can say things that make it bad for us all 

fix the problem the only way is come to the source 

don't be a Trojan Horse help us change the course 

everybody knows that it's bad in the 'hood 

so check what you rappin' about if it ain't to the good 

I did my part a long time ago I changed my views 

ain't no gang bangin' & slangin' just hangin' with trues 

give it up to my Creator & that you can quote 

but mothafuckas still see me as a scapegoat 

yeah like that night when Biggie died at Quincy Jones spot 

like 400 other people yeah I heard some shots 

broke away with the crowd nervous obviously 

& the mothafuckas blamed it on me 

What the hell!?! 



Chorus 



Check it out this song is dedicated to the two most prolific writers 

in rap music history Tupac Shakur & the Notorious B.I.G. 

It's also dedicated to the little homie from 60's 

that lost his life at that party 

Rest in peace y'all

Yeah ain't nothin' changed y'all niggas still obvious. 
Yeah it's for real though hmph 
[Rapping: ]
Now we don't want to talk about all the people I'm supportin' 
That's more important to a nigga than them diamonds you sportin' 
Ain't a sell out or a bail out although life is a bitch 
And I'm beginning to think that they don't want to see Quik rich 
Cause I'm gon' gather up my homiez & put something in they bellies 
Ride around the town bumpin' that CD from R.Kelly 
Gettin' at them ghetto queens if you know what I mean 
'cause it ain't nothin' like some lovin' dipped in afro sheen 
Break it down with two gates in that burgundy eight 
'cause real riders don't three wheel they just drown on the skate 
Send a care package to my homiez up in Natches 
And shoot a kite 'bout how these suckas keep my Benz up in scratches 
It ain't no puzzle that's to be expected 
Sometimes I think they only come around it just to see if I wrecked it 
I feel like hittin' the 101 leavin' town on a bike 
On my way up to the Bay to clear my mind cause it's like... 

[Chorus (R.Kelly) ]
Everyday is a scuffle 
Turnin' them corners to get my hustle 
Every single dollar is a struggle 
That's how it is comin' up in the ghetto 

[Maus-Berg: ]
Now I don' been through it all pushin' work on the boulevard 
Runnin' from the 5-0 in somebody else car 
Ghetto dreams so it seems to be easy 
Think about my life & I get queasy 
Pumpin' the pimp knowin' it ain't helpin' me 
But the ghetto got me trapped thinkin' this is how it's s'posed to be 
A cold thang when you knowin' yo' gang ain't got yo' back 
But you still put yo' life on the line for no snaps. 

[R.Kelly: ]
This ghetto world is one big battlefield 
That's why we get rich and move to them hills 
Everywhere we go the haters tag along 
But don't let that stop you get yo' hustle on 

[Maus-Berg:] 
But dog you gotta do yo' thang get yo' grind on 
Eliminate the fake & keep yo' game strong 
Don't let the streets be yo' downfall 
Keep it real with yo'self & you gon' rise 'til you ball dog 

[Chorus ]

[Quik:] 
It's gettin' down to ground level but tryin' to keep time 
'cause my hustle & my tustle is my beats & my rhymes 
And I'm lovin' this collabo' 'cause Rock Land is saucy 
And Quik is trying to get Versace staying flossy wit Mausy 
But the... 

[Maus-Berg: ]
...drama don't stop but you can make it better 
Don't point your finger at the next man get yo' cheddar 
Lifestyles of a thug ebonic definition dog nothin' but love 
But we gon' ride to 'til we can't ride no mo' 
Pop a bottle a pair of D's and let the wind blow 
When you get it appreciate it 'cause those who ain't got it gon' hate 
Every dime is a struggle so I'ma suffer everyday 

[Quik: ]
Now my conscience got me wonderin' do I be in the flow 
And this sucka's got me wonderin' if he friend or foe 
Now do I sin to grow, knowin' there's consequences 
And I'm tired of gettin' bent 'cause it's dullin' my senses 

[Chorus 'til end]",It's Like Everyday,1999

Hey man so far I've been listenin' to your album
And I ain't heard nothin' you could kick back and smoke a beadie to

Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggas think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, 
So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
Ha feel me?

I'm barely standin, and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin' through the street lights, 'cause we like, yo nigga
Get your mobb on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggas poppin, welcome to our casino, 'cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin' for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin' bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be poppin' so I'm stoppin' at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the late night

""Last night last night changed it all""
In the late night!
""Last night""
""I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be""
?
In the late night!

""Last night last night changed it all""

""I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be""

In the late night!

Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
Ain't nothin' like bein' a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin' that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
Was poppin' like like cocked Glocks with hollow-tip rounds

From booty calls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin'
If I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggas gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the Gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

""Last night last night changed it all""
""Last night""
""I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be""

""Last night last night changed it all""

Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggas in low-lows, pursuin' mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
In the drop-top Jag', how many niggas wanna be me?
Game is automatic, mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissing
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my niggas up in Clentin gettin' weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin'
Slappin' niggas known for tellin' bitches fuck it in the late night

""Last night last night changed it all""
It's in the late night!
""Last night""
""I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be""

DJ Quik,"Lay there, please don't move baby.
On me, don't you stop.
Doggy, comin' through baby
Watch me hit the spot.
You make me wanna speak Spanish
You make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot.
Strawberries soakin' in amaretto out in the limo.
Be spitty, got the car lookin' pretty, in the window.
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo.
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy.
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin' my brain.
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky.
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey.
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left.
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man.
I can even make you feel me when you're usin' your hand.
I'm confident, like an MVP
Got the key to the CPT
Lookin' for a G like me
She F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at?
True love only can be that.
I'm tellin you that you the shit.
Call me when you get this hit.

Do I love her, do I need her? (Suga Free: nuh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no, no)
And should I treat her (no, no) like no other? (nah)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free.

Do I love her? (uh huh)
Do I need her? (Oh, yeah)
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
No I don't love her, (mm hmm)
And I don't need her (Yeah, yeah)
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her.

See baby, I got a spot to fill.
And all that callin' me out my name gonna have you 
Runnin' down the street barefooted again sayin' ""not for real!""
And how you gonna blame mine?
Dawon and Suga Free the same person
But you will never catch me and him in the same room at the same time
Baby, you not yo best, I called you 
'cause I was broke, hoeless, and short on these little ends
And it wasn't for no sex.
I see you still messin' wit yo phony ballers.
But when they tired of you 
You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin' me for 20 dollars.
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money.
What? you stuck?
Hoe, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up.
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet.
But I'll give you a dirt rock
Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet.
Baby wanna eat-eat?
'cause Suga Free-Free
Will go gleek-gleek
And tweak-tweak
And put yo all to sleep-sleep.
Ooh, I'm a tell (I'm a tell)
Suga Free pop a beat and spit a rap so swell.
She said, ""suga free, you know anything about cars, honey?""
I said, yeah, you fill em up with hoes
Take em to the hoes store
So they can get that money!

Do I take my money out and feed her? (no way)
And do I treat her (no) like no other (man)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother suga free.

Aah, do I love her do I need her? (DJ Quik: Oh, yeah)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yea you do)
Do I love her? (mm hmm) Do I need her? (fo sho)
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, Devil be gone! I'm leaving (yeah)

See, that's what y'all get for underestimatin me and Suga Free. 
We told y'all we was magical, way back in 1996.
But y'all didn't feel that. Y'all chose to sleep on us.
Baby, we so powerful, we can make the rain stop (Rain, ne me nome)

Do I love her, do I need her?
Do I take my money out and feed her?
And do I treat her (mm mm) like no other? (naw)

DJ Quik,"My name is Quik, yeah, this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo, I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off

Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me 'cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again

My name is Quik or just call me Q
But it doesn't really matter to you
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin' I just gotta keep cursin'

This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I co get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at

Yo, I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat that's playin'

Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the ruthless P.O.W.
'Cause Quik's doin' it Compton style
That's the city and you say you could get some yo
It's quiker said than dunn

Woo, woo

They made it easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model nor a Dr. Seuss
But I'm not a gangsta and I'm about to get stupid

I guess it's time for the drama
With the Q you I K comma
Now that's drama so pay attention
By the way I must mention I'm comin' off
Hard in the third dimension

With the glare but you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the Q on the Compton tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip

'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Theo is a DJ not a lawyer dope, fly employer
On the static, that's my station to get the money, the women
While we dippin' round tha nation

Boy, Mister Quiks of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gone still my name if ya don't even know me

Blak Tone, what's up?
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound and next time
I'm peelin' ya cap to let ya know where I'm comin' from
Quik said it and it shall be dunn

Woo, woo

Creatin' dope jams are the part of the cycle
Quiker said than dunn, yeah, that's the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly once ya know
But would if she's ugly, if she come she a ho?

Don't ask to battle me home boy
What's that you wanna battle me boy
Ya better be strapped 'cause where I'm from
It ain't all about that playin'
Now that's what I'm sayin'

Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody wants to know the A G E
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15

The fellaz would annoy me the ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do I wishin' nothin' ladies do
'Cause the ladiez I luv 'em nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off

I'm the real Quikster 'cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off, the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy, its quiker said than dunn

Just a Quik dedication to tha creator of Gangsta Rap music
Mr. Erik, Eazy E, Wright, that's how its done

Woo, woo

You might not know it but you
You gotta say it baby

How did you get the Mercedes and the Escalade lately
How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair
A broken mirror
Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
that's when the fun came

Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he want to hit that
Always want to drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed
Take you out to see a movie
Hoe please

I could hit you in the car and it'll be just as fun
There's six lil letters that describe you hoe

And talking about bout some shit that really you don't even know bout
The way i see it you a slick instigata
You thank you low key but you steamin like hot potatoe

Chocolate strawberry or vanilla couldn't shake a
Jankie ass nigga like you
You built with fly paper
Leave shit around you and its gone good-bye later

Always got your hand stuck out askin for shit
Instead of working you be begging trying to get rich quick
Faking acting like you interested just 2 hang around
Tell a nigga you a part of this and know you ain't down

Tellin them about the famous niggas that you know

For niggas like you me and G made this song

My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggas gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the Gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle

In the drop-top Jag', how many niggas wanna be me?
Game is automatic, mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissing
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my niggas up in Clentin gettin' weeded

Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door

[Verse: Shade Sheist] 
They want to know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

Throat-choke a hoe, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your hoe
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere

When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
""Hey nigga where you goin'?""
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
y'all niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes.

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm ""The Answer"" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, ""if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs.""

And watch me come through and get it crackin why'all

We try to get it down just as far as it gets
Cause all I have to do is hop back and spit
And watch all the lil' mommas start havin fits
When I slide through the city in my Escalade
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, cause we extra paid
Tryin to stay sharp as a razor blade
And you thinkin 'bout now that we got it made
And I'ma take you right down, that ain't the case
Ain't nuttin like mo' chips in my safe
Stop skinnin and grinnin all in my face

New year, new record, time to do bigger shit
Caught a plane to cali linked with my nigga quik
I figure with the combination we bomb the nation but stay calm and patient
As the world get hyped from hearin our musical conversation
This a beautiful situation right here
Given birth on the track cuz the cypher stay pregnant with ideas
And we rockin it - rock, rock, rockin it
Tell the hater players put a sock in it!
Proper shit, that you got to get, cause we properly document
How cats look more like dicks than the washington monument
Validly try to challenge me, but who you racin wit'
It's amazing the lyrical lingerie I be lacin shit, we be blazin it

Could you really blame a nigga if you fucked a skate
You ain't even pay that's why you flunked the date

DJ Quik,"Now let's get down to business, bitches
'Cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin' to diss this
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One two three four five six seven nine, ten, Eiht you can't win
'Cause all the way around nigga I gets respect
And youse a nigga that can't even get no props in your set
Tragniew Park you say huh

Wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin'
So listen close, 'cause I don't want y'all to miss
That I'm bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
Acacia, Poplar Maple Spruce Cedar Elm
West side trees sprayin' all the fleas
That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders
So niggaz watch yo' ass at that center divider
Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame

When I caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game
You looked up and you seen my niggaz comin
And you looked like your bitch ass was 'bout to start runnin'
But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation
And see if we can fix this little situation
But would I fuck you up was what you wondered
Yeah, that's probably why you changed your little pager number
But bitches like you don't grow

You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
And callin' me skinny, youse a clown
I'ma call you Theo, 'cause you weigh ninety-two point three pounds
Wack ass actor, movie script killer
Fool don't you know, Quik is still the nigga
Compton psycho, boy you oughta quit
Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
You need to stay down you Compton clown

And get off of the nuts of the niggaz with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'ma boot your motherfuckin' ass to the moon
You need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the people, commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and, cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the see-P-T
No better yet T-T-P, or the niggaz that look up to me
I make it my business, to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever well that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand, that there's only one DJ Q-you-I-K
With no see still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and, depositin' fat checks and
Gettin mad sex while I floss the NSX and

Doin' what I wanna, and youse a goner nigga
For thinkin that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin' yak with all my niggaz 'cause it's tooted good
So don't knock it till you try it, 'cause Eiht he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
So put tha P in it represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa
Let me take a load off my scrotum little pest
If it don't make dollars nigga, you know the rest

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the people, commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie ass niggaz keep on ridin' the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik ain't your average
Everyday motherfucker, slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon' be the first you little trick ass hoe
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck

'Cause when I caught your ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence, you left expedient
You ain't no fuckin' killer, youse a comedian, beyotch
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin' your set a bad name wit your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue
Yeah you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin' on the West side
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side

Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a
Real killer, tell me did you feel a little nervous
You was in the shadow of death with two trey-five-sevens
Pointed at your chest whatchu gon' do, where was your
Niggaz that kill at you ain't got no killers so kill dat
Holdin' up your hands and beggin' for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
I'm through playin' with your punk ass
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Shouts goes out, to my well known road dog
What's up Dozun Tru, they don't understand it baby
They can't fade us out here on these Compton streets
It's bigger than they can imagine to the whole entire
Death Row family both sides, whassup niggaz
And my nigga Big Suge, known for keepin' shit poppin'

To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-see, little straight G
And that little singin' ass nigga Danny Boy
Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this
I'm the first nigga that was ""Bangin' on Wax""

And it don't stop, and it won't stop

With so much heat it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter 'cause I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas why'all too whack to dance
Why'all need to ease up off that now before why'all splint why'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down you and I niggas don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't want your bitch

I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL

Somebody play the potato
Let's take a ballad
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid

And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth
And time to shine pitching a fit
'Cause somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
Five hundred dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
'Cause why'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that Anj and Palmason and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it

So which one of you old ragedy ass bitches want to come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the Cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dance floor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw why'all a ragedy ass party
And why'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush

I turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit 

I'm keepin my rocks in the house and not in my pocket

Fresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders 

Checking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks 

Donzelly dippin sticks went and bought um a 6 

And 500 block peach running thangs ya see 

Moving gallon after gallon and key after key 

I'm telling you I done seen it all 

From niggaz hitting the sherman and the passout on the wall 

From cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let there panies fall 

Teeth rotten hair gone, 

and whole checks get blown 

But then i'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam 

Saved them, splitting rocks, 

to the um tic toc 

I went from wearing khakis to Sergio Teccini 

While my rocks is disappearing like the great Whodini 

I bought a gang of clothes, all of my equiptment 

And getting somthing new with each and every shipment 

Money gets made and money gets spent

My niggaz Playa Ham and Gina gave me a place to stay 

On my way up from bottom rock 

Bitches starting to jock 

Cause my hair is getting longer 

And games getting stronger 

To pull my on weight I went and got me a job 

But by then Ham and Gina really started to squab 

About weather I should go or stay 

She told him either he goes or you go we both was on our way 

So he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning, 

clowning with playas all around me just astounding 

My nigga pimpin Carl got staring with that hair an

That nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed 

And hoes just come and go in and out

I exercise one muscle that's my strap finger
And I can't call it how I see it no more
Cause these niggas'll take ya words back and twist em' like a pretzel
And these bitches be the same too
Comin' with that sob story crocodile tears trying to gang you
And that's exactly what the game do
And if you ever get caught dirty with a nigga she gon' blame you
So what in the hell you want to floss her for?
It's supposed to be bout' what a baller nigga cost that ho (yeah)
You givin' a game of black eye in ya S-5
While you niggas kick back poppin' X you let that 'cause' dry
And that bitch supposed to carry her own car note (c'mon, yep)
And don't be going for that shit ""I got a sore throat"" (yeah)
Give that bitch a couple of Sucrets (mmm hmm)
Or give that that ho that application down on Vernon to that duplex (see ya)

Do we play ball? Do we move that weight?
All I got for a motherfuckin ho is hate
Bitch want to get drunk and high
Point that booty on to the sky
Square ass bitch go bake a pie
Get a tattoo of a dick in ya eye

DJ Quik,"[ verse 1 ]
Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(compton) yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, dj quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin
I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in compton

(born and raised)
(born and raised)
(born and raised in compton)

(where you from, fool? )
(compton)

[ verse 2 ]
Now compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is dj quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
Cause I'm a veteran from the c-o-m-p-t-o-n
Kick it

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
Dj quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

Yo, check this shit out

[Ludacris (Dj Quik)] 
Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
Hey man let me ask you something man
You ever have one of them days where you felt like
You might to got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
You know what I mean like you just got your paycheck
Paid off a car note or something
Just jumped out the shower feeling fresh than a motherfucker
With ya good shoes on, what you know what I'm talking bout?
(You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?)
Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
Like call everybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
(In Compton we call that ""spur of the moment"")
Well let's do it, spur of the moment, what up?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car lost up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flipping through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't tripping on child support

[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we goin' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chilling with Luda
'Cris stop and twist the Buddha got me feeling like this is it
If we goin' party, we goin' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we goin' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You would of thought you would of learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dog

[Chorus: Ludacris (Kimmi)]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
(And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright)
G'd up, my mind is freed up
(From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright)

[DJ Quik]
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does being mental cost? If you ain't knowing you already lost

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Remembering the days on the block sipping whiskey
Running 'round grinning, running 'round sinning
Getting lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinning
But I'm all grown up now, less throwing up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's arrived
And tonight we goin' celebrate being alive right

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's looking this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feeling quite differ
Can't nothing go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools want to scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Cause I do ? elevation
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic

All the ladies drink free, all the players grab a tab
That's how that's supposed to be, drinking Casamigos
Fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now, she so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down

Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to

There are miracles in life I must achieve

I got a ride

Hey girl, just imagine me and you, along the road
Switchin from silent gear to a moany mode
All you gonna hear is that's the motor, of course
(But don't let it get hot, or you'll feel the force 
Hello, my name is Kangol Kid (You can call him Kangol, if you choose)
I'm Dr. Ice (How can you tell?) You can tell by the mous'
And I'm the Educated Rapper (The brainiac
And Mixmaster) woo-hah (The four is back)
Individually speakin', though I'm speakin' for the crew
We all have rides, I hope you fellas do too
Mine is very powerful, yes, this is true
Mine can do tricks (What can yours do?)
Mine won't disagree with me, it's never frontin'
All I gotta say is: ""Yo, let's go skeezer huntin'!""
After those command my ride will stand
Taller and prouder than any man
Crashin' through vicious, on wet roads even
In other words, it's (Skeezin season!)
And brakes of course for my protection
So I don't waste my fuel injection
I'm makin' it clear, the way I steer
I'll reach my destination (Ah, I'm here)

I got a ride 
I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I want to die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You want to know why? Well, because

It only takes one passenger when it's hot
Unless I want to share it, okay, why not?
Just imagine a volcano when it's bound to erupt
(You want to ride?) Come on girl, hurry up
Tell your mother where you're goin', and don't forget
If your mother want to come, tell your pops: ""Don't fret""
If he wants you home soon, tell him that's insane
(And if he says: ""Picture that"") consider it framed
(I got a ride) As if you didn't know
And if I catch a flat, girl, give me a blow
'Cause I don't carry spares, cause spares, they cost
And plus my nuts are too hard to come off
(You dig it?)
You see, my ride is not a stretch-limo Cadillac
To tell the truth, I think my ride is much longer than that
So if you ever see my ride, girl, face to face
I doubt that it'll fit in your parking space
But I'll (push) if you want to (push) if I gotta
And we can even (push) for the hell, why nada?
It's lovable and huggable and bendable
I won't sell it to ya, baby, but it's rentable
And if you're wonderin' why, I'll tell you what for

I got a ride
I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I want to die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You want to know why? Well, because

You see my ride 
A lotta fuel you give it, premium or regular
Any kind of fluid from a female etcetera
Four-wheel drive, so I can get there in a giffy
And turbo-jogs in case I'm lookin' for a quickie
But the tighter the roads, the harder I'll pursue
And my goal in my life with my ride is to shoot
For the finish line, so I can get there quick
Ask Bobby, Jimmy, Jack, or you can even ask (Dick)
You can even ask my mechanic
When she saw my ride, she didn't panic
You see, I got garages all over these parts
So I can park the ride whenever it gets dark
I got a sunroof, so wide, you can't miss it
Before I stick my head out, I gotta unzip it
Hey yo, I never got a ticket, if I do one day
They'll have a hard time towin' this baby away

I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things

But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be fresh to rock wit fresh

Not for the...
The human beat box on the entertainer
No other label that fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainder
And I'm also known as a beat box trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I'm finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick

Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was walking downtown (Word Rick) word
(Sure) All along, no one to be wit
Step on the D-train, 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so)
So I sat beside her
Then she went roar, she was Tony the Tiger
I said, oh darn, there has been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick, not frosty flake
(Oh, golly wolly) She was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but you can call me Michelle

Tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

We all Came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can?t nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can?t nobody damn see it
I can?t agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect ain't just something that?s understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don?t wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas?ll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I?m goin through it too bruh

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

I?m doin this for the hood and the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya?ll don?t feel so bad
Know it?s hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long, ya get whoopin?s and just laugh
Momma washin? clothes and find a lil? blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin? like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I?m passin? atleast 8 J?s or mo?
Rent been late for 8 days or mo?
But slangin? blow a better habit than 8 days of snow

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I?d a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon? die
It?s goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God?s arms now
She said I don?t believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins you can start right now
Know ya scarred right now 'cause you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain?t shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip

Ain't it funny how the money makes you separate the real and fake?
I started off small time victim of the game, a Monte Carlo to a Bentley and a diamond ring.
I got fame but mayne my whole world changed.
Some niggas left me in the rain, my girls changed, they changed on me!
I thought I got lucky, two hundred G's took my grandmother from me.
I hit my knees (Why lord?!) I tried syrup I tried weed I couldn't cope nigga.
Head down crying tears at the hospital.
A broken home, tried to get my hustle on nigga killed Lil Ivy my soul gone.
I bought my mama a house she cried instantly, all that shinin got my niggas in penitentiary!

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I can clearly see the sunshine, but I'm steady walking through the rain!

[Lil Trill:]
Still got hatred in the city after all that we done 
Did all the toy give always school clothes and things.
Even for Easter givin the kids bikes 
And for that they ain't cryin up in Carroltyn now that ain't right.
We still smile though cause of the sunshine, wonder what I'll do if I could press rewind.
I done seen a lot half both sides of the field, the best of both worlds and yeah I'm for real.
Mama got seven kids with pops I stand alone.
I'm walking through the rain but still I move on, I just started so right now I'm far from done.
I keep moving on until I see the full sun.
Patiently waiting but the best is still yet to come, 
I guess things happen for a reason when its said and done.
Say Lil B keep your head up just take it serious bra 
Keep your faith in God cause he's the one who lay at us.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Diabetes steady eating my insides fucking my vision up I swear to God I feel like giving up.
Some times I'm laughin' with my money machine, but they trying to put me on dialysis machine.
I-v's in my arms, I know I'm doing wrong no insurance back to early can't long.
Being a daddy only thing that make me happy, I'm tired of getting sick same thing for young savage.
I try to do right and help my community police still kicking at my door Dirty motherfuckers.
You probably think I got the world at my hands, but really dog I got the world on my shoulders!
When I look at your son I see your face homie

Wish I could take it all back sometimes, truth is I don't even like to rap sometimes.

But something feels so wrong
It seems like lately
Your feelings are not as strong

I feel it in your touch

I can't read
What's runnin' through your mind
But if you think its over
Just tell me, tell me, tell me

Go on and find another woman
Who is just what you need
You can go try but I won't stand right by
Why you wonder, wonder, so please

Go on and find another woman
Whose as good to you as me
Just wait and see that there's no one like me
who will love you, love you, love you like I do

Now you know I need you
But honey I've got my pride
After all this time you should tell me
What you're feeling inside

If you're trying to protect me
Then you're not being fair, no, no
'Cause I deserve a real lover
Not someone pretending to care

I can't read what's going through your mind
But if you think its over, tell me, tell me, tell me

Go on and find another woman
Who is just what you need
You can go try but I won't stand right by
Why you wonder, wonder, so please

Go on and find another woman
Whose as good to you as me
Just wait and see that there's no one like me
Who will love you, love you, love you

Go on and on and find
I hope she's just what you need
You can go try but I won't stand by
While you wonder, wonder

Go on, go on, I hope she's good to you
Just wait and see that there's no one like me

Who will love you
Who will love you

Hey yo, I just left the studio, and it's about 2 in the morn' 
I just finished doin a song 
Now I'm ready for sleep 
But first I want spaghetti to eat 
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street 
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat 
Then I got a beep 
My voice is harsh, barely can speak 
I called back on the cell 
It's Coley, mad as hell 
He told me to listen well as he started to yell 
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend 
And they just got a room in the Holiday Inn"" 
""It's my wife, you sure?"" 
""Yeah I'm sure 
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door"" 
""Yo, say no more, which one?"" 
""The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge"" 
""We goin' hurt those hoes"" 
""And hurt both of them kids"" 
Now I'm in the Range 
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change 
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin dames 
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation 
These niggas fuckin up my reputation 
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome 
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill 
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cup 
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up 
""Yo, who that in the background?"" 
""It's Tommy Giss"" 
""Oh, I didn't recognise you with your hat down 
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out"" 
""Yeah, wo goin to take the backroute 
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on 
We ain't leavin till everyone's dead and all the cash gone"" 
""We goin to get our laugh on when we're through 
But right now we got a job to do"" 
""So let's do it"" 
Hey yo, I stepped to the deskclerk 
Put the gat to her dress-shirt 
Told her to listen up before she get hurt 
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males 
What room they got?"" 
She paused and said ""212"" 
Took the steps now I'm out of breath 
I gotta stop smokin 
Them cigarettes goin be the cause of my death 
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off 
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off 
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase 
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face 
Then my other two niggas ran in 
Each had a cannon 
Ready to take care, how we done planned it 
""These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate"" 
We know they got stacks 
Cause they don't move with nothin but weight 
We got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use 
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin 'em loose 
""Hey man, I kicked Mike in his face 
So I just had your back 
You want to live and tell my nigga where the stash at"" 
He gave me the address then I ran outside 
But first I took the keys to his van outside 
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash 
A 100 pound of grass, and 2 million in cash 
I was dumb glad 
The sit didn't fit in one bag 
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth 
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck 
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks 
""Hey yo', fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs"" 
Man that's four bodies 
Two outta-towners and two hotties 
And after that we ain't sleep for three days 
We hit the PJ's, split the money threeways 
Now we all laughin hard, gettin nice and weeded

If you're not knowing that my name is Rokka 
Dilated platform representin' with the LP

Yo, I take control grab the horse by the mane 
I'm that New York type of driver on this L.A. terrain 
Make it rain, when it pours we flood, cover your system 
Intuitive, straight up, avoided you by instinct 
You could take cover, dodge radar detection 
But try to dodge weeded out by natural selection 
It's finally here, the moment of the long awaited 
We represent the West, Lootpack and Dilated

So, better back up 'cause DJ Romes is gonna go off and 
Bringing his Technics turntable style straight out of his coffin 
I'll continue to pull out my menu of styles and bend you 
In half then laugh on behalf of my whole Lootpack staff 
Brothers be like ""I want to hear y'all ish"", at least you've waited 
First heard it hear, negative criticism is mad appreciated 
My direction takes course of a fraudulent, fake endorserer 
Thinking he's a dope rhyme style enforcerer (to the world of hip hop) 
If you don't support, you're amongst those who's gonna get dissed 
And dismissed when we come back with 10 times the force of a

Earthquake, we laugh in Cali wild so watch the earth shake 
From the first take, pop in your box, the Long Await 
We rollin' like Juggernauts, plug in spots, 
Not talkin' bout runnin' glocks preparing for incoming stocks 
Yo it's the Pack with them Triple Optic kids 
While we keep this art real, y'all worry bout your pocket lids

Hey yo, some are goin' Platinum, skills are still lackin' 
I meditate and coach, action like Phil Jackson

Who's the real divine?
You like that

Let me tell you

I be all in you like you disrespected space in my lyric zone
I'm like a pit, with a leg in his mouth, I bring it home
Bumpy ripping everything known, block every blow zone
I make you sit your ho ass down, turn off your microphone
Cause after me its un-rippable
I slap you in your mouth, your drinks'll be unsippable
I got miles of styles, you must be out your motherfuckin' brain
To think I'm not the nicest in the game
Disconnected from your mainframe, punched cocked
Twirl your nose up Murray the cop, to the beat down you don't stop
When Fox and Bumpy keep it hot
End the whole beef with just one shot, niggaz I fear not
This piece of steel with the screen on top
Projects uncut chyna white dope
Leave a freeze in a nigga throat
I fight for this like the right to vote
The poison I spit, they'll never be an antecdote
You niggaz thought I put my mic down
Cause the industry's scared cause I put my fight down
Before I do that, I sell it out the trunk and make a mill
Now that's a real rap nigga deal
In 99 I'm droppin niggaz like flies
Fuck flowin, I'm turning niggaz into Jesse Owens
Cock the four pound, keep it going, I'm in your dresser room layin
You bitch ass niggaz just start prayin baby

Hopin somebody remember old rap faces
Fuck that, I'ma five borough thorough MC
Where I go, New York goes, keepin New York flows
Niggaz be switchin cause they not sure
Your style is played out soft shit like Valure
In red and black living rooms when the system booms
He's a nice little diss to whomever whom
Come against me and I give you one of three picks:
Get shot, get stuck up, get your ass kicked
Bring your whole unit, and I be lyrically gunning em
Cause Freddie Foxxx be the illest thing since Run and em
I be running through you like a Hummer, you don't want none o'
So hot I turn December 25 into summer
I scrutinize niggaz and bring em down to size
My lyrical body slam will leave you paralized
Fuck what you memorize, I take you out of drive
And leave you neutralized and black in both your eyes
My rise is your demise, shut down your enterprise
Fox and Primo, we stay close like thighs
Bumpy got nine lives, like a cat
With a full gat, keep it underground fuck that!

I still got a full clip of unstoppable shit
You mean to tell me motherfuckers never knew
That I be bustin' niggaz in the head with beer bottles like Guru
Check the mic one, two make sure its on
When I bring it to your headquarters, word is bond
Heads up, eyes and ears open

That you could catch rec like me
You got a better chance at kickin' down a tree
With no legs, doing a handstand on two eggs
Motherfucker, I got lyrical instinct, fuck what you write
I'm The Source like magazine, on the cover with the Ruger 16
I ain't scared to diss a MC, but ask him if he scared to diss me
I bet he won't disagree, he'll probably start sayin his throat
Hurt, his mom's is sick with a bad knee
Or start screamin' he's about dough
He's just a faggot with a whack flow
Don't walk up on me talkin' freestyles and off the top of the dome
I beat you down and send your ass home
I'm on my own time, I write my own rhymes
You wanna be the nominee? you brave now?

We got the film right here

Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they naming the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is coming soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cocking pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo, you get paid?
Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feeling
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks; one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, ""It's on!"", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claiming you pissed off

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

The one man on the planet
That'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this – and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy
Pushing a ten speed, screaming to Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

I'm thinking man, we don't always have to talk about

We don't have to make things so complicated (no doubt)

Deep, I'm using canyons you can't get by the cannon (no way)
Season veterans, the hawk has landed
Toxic tandem, the docotorum of mad men
The planet of apes is now a main attraction
How does it happen? If I knew I'd tell ya
They'd probably try to say I worshiped devils in the cellar
It's just a slight of hand, like Penn and Teller
The mighty dollar, is taller than the scholar
Ask your neighbourhood martyr about the fire starter
People are driven to buildings when I let it out my system
Built my the hands of man and women
Thinking of quitting? Now's the time
There's more job opportunites at the back of the line
Applications, and registrations
Feels more like an investigation
Now how's that for a demonstration

Spit venom over cobra, hatched in October
Libra scorpion is taking over

Lets give a big round of applause for adrenalin
You ain't right, I'ma fucking phantom at night
That wears a mask by day, with a temper tantrum
Don't light my fuse, 'cause if this dynamite blows up in your face
There won't be no one left to clean up the place

It's the hands free, hurt you virtue

I mean I be building where you renting your space see
I'm clean, all I ever had was my horses was for the reign
Grand stay clear of slander, its naked to see
That you a fake, when I talk about me, the lawfully wed
I've read six bars written over three days
Spittin em two or three ways, perfectin the phrase
Never on some ""hurry up and wait for a plate""
I'll eat what's available, my fate is unjailable
Patron saint of the flow, you're like ""say it ain't so""
I'm full circle though, no way to corner me

Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (Hey, wait!)
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it

Lesson two, face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen (you're gonna fuckin' check this out)
Lesson three, get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the whitest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can

Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me (get away from me)

'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P (uh)

You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (here!)

I rip Mystikal's voice box out, scream in his ear 
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it

I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans (Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had

I approach you, walk in circles
Spirit of the hunter I could hunt you
Locked in emotional realm
My private world is painful
And I don't care if it rain in my window pane inside I'm a insane angel
No gold at the end of my rainbow
Get a hold of myself 'fore my brain go boom
Sittin' in my room consumed with doom
Doors open force flow through me
Springtime bloomin' daphodiles
Still got a six shot revolver
My gangster friends wont get this album
Not my problem
I hibernate but I still called 'em

[Chorus: x2]

Revel in my glory, kneel before me
Or the straight jacket come around
Grey casket underground
Name captivate a crowd, leave 'em in suspense
Maximum overdrive last of my kind alive
Mastermind every single movement like a puppeteer
Go for the throat again, no friend we don't pretend
Send you to the other end flames on the flesh burn
Meet nephastopholese, heat make it hard to breathe
Leave while you have the chance I could change my mind
Advantage of ricochet adventures in anime
Tear away the back drop revealing the hopeless
Incentive to innovate, allow me to demonstrate
Pinpoint and penetrate the heart like a steel shaft
Birds circle my prey this verse workin' my way
The thirst never left me I just had to find it
Hazardous is chemical no MC identical

[Chorus: x2]

Exert energy, hurt enemy
Love run raw through the veins of my army
Nothin' feel better than the strength of my movement
My revolution, offer solution
Triple seven on a path less traveled
Psycho psychedelic thoughts unravel
Master thief drink psycho juice
With like-minded maniacs who like abuse

Insult to injury, full color imagery
Revenge will be the motivation, open wounds, lacerations
Focus my fascination, nose to the grindstone
This is not an accident battle axe accurate
Immaculate structure my alphabetic framework
Strength of a monolith, brains of a novelist
Ominous approach engulf words like a bonfire
Spiritual vision quest, sacred as eagle's nest

It tells me where you've been through
I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I need to bury the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let my conscience be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me

First of all yo gotti represent every thug
Went to school graduated operated with drugs
Had knowledge went to college fucking bitches with all
Up to no good in da hood but to play with my dawg
Been had six figures and that ain't no lie
I was fly class of 2000 at Trezvant High
I had gold like whoa! I just wanted to be 
A fucking lawyer but that was to long for me
Never knew I'll rob with the blackout squad
I admit when I was young shit I had a job
That was cool at first but I had to get paid
A 150 dollars a week must think I'ma slave
Maybe that's the reason why niggas been fucking with birds
Got the urge and the nerves to kick a bitch to the curb
I'm bout tied of bitches asking me have I been in love
I'm a human being bitch til I do pump blood
Let the rumor do some shit that a nigga didn't like
When I was young and dumb didn't know wrong from right
My old man telling me young cat walk like
Out of mind out of sight now my head on right

I tried me a 9 to 5 but it'n work
Put my trust in a bitch end up getting nerved

[verse 2]
I was 12 years old in the vista cove
I didn't want to get a job I want to sell me some more
I didn't want to go to church I wanted to get me some dough
Or a European Chevy with a matching vogue
They say I'm madeful ungrateful 'cause I ain't faithful
Good things come and go but I'll miss them later
Tip so niggas know gotti ain't they savior
I'm just trying to fuck all these hoes while I'm able
Big bro in and out the door cutting paper
Lil bro keep them out seen them getting paper
Gotti ask them questions when I seen them at the table
What the fuck is that? and what you doing with that razor?
I'm dead fucking serious
And while he smoking on some dro
And laughing I'm getting more and more furious
Real off experience I seen it first hand
That's why I had to make a plan to get them Benjamins

[chorus 4x]

[verse 3]
Nigga block on lock better tuck that shit
Ain't no motherfucker round that can fuck with this
Call nigga when they really won't infecting this
I&E rap hustlas getting checks for this
How many niggas you know that can go come from above?
Without a bill on the real yeen ain't fucking with us
I be tripping off bitches when they holla at us
With the mind frame they gone get some dollars for us
This a health train come on bitch swallow the nut
And follow it up by getting the fuck off the bus
Catching the cut what don't speak on trust
Don't know what it mean and me speak no English
And me don't work me a thug me no jerk
Back in the day me got my feelings hurt
But never again catch me fucking a friend

Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'ma shine in the booth like a brand new bling
But I don't sing I bust them flows that go so tight with the track

Ya fine bitches pop that puss like ya know it

Roll candy paint, blowin' purple dank, they claim grip grain but I know they ain't

Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it

No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us

If your nines in the car, 'cause mines on my side
Why you lookin' like dat?
Nigga ain't no hoes here
I'm about to ask the waitress what she put in yo' beer
We can get it on, we can do whatever boy (whatever boy)
Don't you ever push your pedal, pump your brake

This should hit you, get you pump, if it get you drunk
It can get you jump!

Bitches trip, niggaz quick
To pull out they chains on sight
Niggaz flip, soon as they announce my name on the mic
So I, gotta kinda watch them niggaz
You know them niggaz roll up beside you
You don't know if they like your car, they don't like you
By the way they lookin', you can't tell if they grimmin' you or admiring you
Whether envy you when they see your tires spinnin'
So you greet 'em as polite
Ly as possible, that nine sit on yo lap, be disrespectful then you leave 'em at the light
Hit that window and squeeze that toaster
Pull off fast and I promise
That I just put his Regal in 3-wheel motion without havin' hydraulics
I call it like I see it
Walk it like I did it
Nigga coughin' up yo kidney
Cough, talkin' bout the kid
My people, I came expectin' the same kinda respect that you want
Some of you steppin' in something by coming and testing it once
They won't let you do nothin' unless you cutting a check
Let me ask you a couple a questions, nigga

Water whippin' with my niggaz tryin' to sew up the city
Back in school

But seekin' some knowledge

Took hold a nigga
Enrolled and showed a nigga
When Gotti around, ain't enough hoes for niggaz
Never did I

A third spot for all of these hoes that I don't love
A fourth spot for me and my shorty that stayed down
The one who stayed strong and helped me through shady grounds
I'm a mean mugger,head buster
Nothin nice
I'm a street hustler
And my motto is rock ice
Streets is callin
Why not picture me ballin
Enjoy it while I got it cause one day I'm gone be fallin

Flag in my right pockets
Star track fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial I'm all about my decimels
Retarded in the booth they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda speak crack and you niggas is crack addicts
The simple mathematics.
You cut the check and I rake in the green like I'm raking the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near feint when they passing
Call my whip Martin but the first name Aston
Tata head niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin'
Think you fucking with me put your cash in, nah I doubt
I was young and reckless when Pete say he was about it
You niggas is ducks howards, cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours
Pop bitch

Uh, uptown back in it
Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis
Black semi,
I've never sat in hemi
That would offend me
Try Maybach on Maybach
Bitch I got stacks yeah
Paychecks on paychecks
And I still want payback
And I still don't play that
I kill on asap
And you don't do sh-t but get money all day
Pussy shoes on my bullets now they running your way
YM young mula young money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama I'm honoured
I blitz your ass like a muthafucking lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of comma's
Still wear red like an old 49ner
Fuck shittin on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F baby bitch I hotter than Uganda

Mama ain't make me to make homies
She make me to make history
So doing that's my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and the target is the industry
Two things I love in the World, good head and victory
You ain't doing it big and broke stop kidding me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr T
This is Misery, no Cathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money slap ya straight
Yeah I'm a big joker so you know I slap you ace

Leave the club with ya girl send her home with an ashy face
Love is a gamble but it's my casino
Pretend that your the loser I hope that she (?)
I hope the game got life insurance
Cause I'm kill it
And all you wack ass rap niggas dying with it
I'm so Harlem eating but so starving
Pockets full of fat like all I do is eat margarine
Millz

Put the flow in the pot
Crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top
It's finger licking hot
His pitch flip cause the nigga flop
My shit hit like the pitch was soft
Niggas cotton balled
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy cross guard but I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fucking law
I bet daddy gone, who wanna make it done
The rocky shit that we up on
Shttin on em like hittin the barn
Hey wait they say money talks
Man you don't speak at all

Mi corazón, golpeará 
Después sé irá 

La luna en el desierto brillará 
Tú vendrás, solamente un beso 
Me dejará 

CORO 
Quien sabe mañana donde irás 
Que harás, me pensarás; 
Yo sé que nunca volverás 
Más pienso que no viviré, 
Cómo podré. 

La angustia why el dolor me dejarán 
Mi corazón, sufrirá 
Why morirá. 

El amor cómo un cóndor volará 
Mi corazón, sufrirá why morirá 
Regresarás. 

CORO 
Quien sabe mañana donde irás 
Que harás, me pensarás; 
Yo sé que nunca volverás 
Más pienso que no viviré, 
Cómo podré.

I learned how to swim this summer

I can even open my eyes when I'm under water

I'm carrying a picture of us in my blues clues lunch box

You are the greatest Daddy !!
I can swing on the swing by myself
Even though I miss you pushing me
Can't you see me ?

I miss how you used to tickle me
Tickle my belly
My belly hurts
I try not to cry

Mommy says it's ok
I know you don't like it when I cry
Never wanted me to be sad
I try Daddy but it hurts

Is it true your not coming home
Maybe someday I can visit you in heaven ok

Enchant my senses

DJ Sammy,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind

DJ Sancho,"Verse one:
It was a cold dark night when I saw myself lookin down,
Realizin I was nolonger around,
At first it was a blur to me that I couldn't feel your touch,
And now that I'm gone,baby I miss you so much
From up here, I can see and hear everything
All the prayers and thoughts that run through your mind,
Night after night, time after time, seenin you cry,
But I'm still here in your heart for the rest of your life.
So I want you to go to sleep with a smile on your face
And I want you to know
That I'm in a better place
I know it seems hard to know that I'm not there
But one day we'll be back together baby I swear yea...

You just don't understand the things that I'm going through
Lonely nights holdin my pillow tight, thinking about you...
I see your face everywhere I turn, I can't be without you
You were the only one that I could turn to, and baby boy
I miss you

verse two:
I see you in the livin room reminicin
With my pictures in your hands and your heart just wishin
That I didn't have to go
How can this be so... we had plans for the future and what to do you don't know
Everybody is tellin things will be alright
But the things you wanted in life are now out of sight
Without the one you love
You feel you can't accomplish
What you want to do
Cause it seems so pointless
But what you have to understand is that I'm still here
I will always be nomatter where you go don't have no fear
So wipe those tears off your face and put my pictures away,
If you ever need me, just put your hands together and pray..

You just don't understand the things that I'm going through
Lonely nights holdin my pillow tight, thinking about you...
I see your face everywhere I turn, I can't be without you
You were the only one that I could turn to, and baby boy
I miss you

Every night I pray to you to come back to me
I ask the lord above
If my love is strong enough
I need you back into my life
Cause I can't go on
Can you hear me mi amor
I'm... just missin you

You just don't understand the things that I'm going through
Lonely nights holdin my pillow tight, thinking about you...
I see your face everywhere I turn, I can't be without you
You were the only one that I could turn to, and baby boy
I miss you

you just don't understand the things that I'm going through

DJ Satomi,"Like a rush on the beach 
At the end of the day 
When the sand is going to be cold under your way 
The season fades 
And you think everything's lost in the waves 

Like a spark in your eyes 
So your love will be mine 
When the sky is going to light and shine 
You take my hands 
And I think that time will give me one more chance 

Do you remember 
A kiss under the moonlight 
When it was summer 
It was love at first sight 

Can you remember 
'Cause I feel the same now 
Until the winter 
Will see blooming this love 

Like a dive in the waves 
I am caught in you love 
And I'm flying in the clouds above 
I feel you near 
And I fear no more the winter 'cause you're here

""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Bahamadia] 
I'm mystical; don't be deceived by the visual 
Visible preference is pure; patent it back to metaphors 
Greetin' 'em Illa del style wild 
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on eight, four poetic meter 
Soarin' way beyond 
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam 
Unsyncopated soul, piercin' earlobes and egos 
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore? 
To the grain

[Guru] 
Lame-game, plain-Jane emcees can't approach these 
I shake chumps like fleas; I hold the keys 
To drive you, guide you, provide you 
With the real joints; ahem, I clear my throat of phlegm 
The architect, selecting the blueprints 
To rid the game of nuisance 
Sucker reducin' with the fusion 
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution 
Stackin' concrete flows; look out below 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles 
Most emcees couldn't see me with bifocal spectacles 
There's no protectin' you; with realness, I'm wreckin' you 
I'm beggin' you - take a look into the cipher 
You're dirt on my windshield, so I'm turnin' on my wipers 
And I can see clearly now 
No other rapper is near me 
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

[Bahamadia] 
Never flip folklores, only realness 
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck 
Respect the architect in this division 
Rhymes written to be hittin' like anti-proton collisions 
Rap newest edition, bringin' the feminine in renditions 
In rare form, defined as optimal for my pedigrees 
In skill three like three-sixty degrees as in well-rounded 
Leavin' the competition dumb-founded 
For when I catch wreck, I astound 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Floor to ceiling, constantly building 
With power to construct towers of rap cream, kid; what? 
Dreamin' you're lyrical, physical, mystical? 
Your concept's mediocre, plus you're way too typical withcha 
Corny delivery and crazy, whack voice 
Mad corny image; that's why I give you jitters 
It figures I'd have to dust you off the scene 
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean

[Bahamadia] 
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate 
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create 
Top notch and on lock like Sentry; opponents could never tempt me 
Samplin' my style like an Akai S-950, and still can't get with me 
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic 
Conductin' phonics like the Philharmonics 
I make in measured melody; kids praise me like the crucifix 
So place Bahamad' amongst your top ten of emcees 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Yeah, neverending, knah I'm sayin? Always buildin'

And of course, my man the legend

[Hard Black]

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them


[Chorus]

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Mau Maus (HOOTIE HOO!) We was born to roll!

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, aim fire

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

How black? BLAK WOMB TIL WE REACH THE BLACK HEARSE

What's black? - SHADE OF THE UNIVERSE


[Mo Black - Canibus]

Yo, yo

Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

Black monk like Thesalonius, the government got a black phobia

That's why they tap my black Nokia

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Black thugs, wrap drugs in backwoods

Smoke til they got black tongues, black lips and black lungs

Blak iz blak, wack MC's get smacked

Forced to go home and dial 1-800-I-CAN'T-RAP


[1/16th Black - MC Serch]

Aiyyo who that? Yo right there; blue eyes, and black hair

Kill 'em with a rhyme, or the bottom of my Nike Airs

So quick son pick one, you don't want me to finish

or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

Mr. 1/16th, born to kill your self esteem

Born from part devil, part cracker from Queens

Knowledge that we drop, you don't even build with

That's like me winnin a rap Grammy, givin it to Lyn(?) Smith


[Chorus]


[Jo Black]

Yo, yo

Everything black is wack and shit

Blackheads, blackmail, black cats and shit

Funerals, niggaz gotta wear black and shit

Black cars, black clothes on they backs and shit

Blackballed, if we don't kiss they ass and shit

Blacklisted see ya nigga, and you're gone that's it

White bitches, they wanna be black and shit

Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit


[Double Black]

Aiyyo all the Mau Maus gather up and let's attack

because they're tryin to fuck with our images

and I think that shit is crazy wack

And as a matter of fact, they want us niggaz

to smile and laugh - I guess they never seen a bloodbath

Brothers and sisters are dyin, babies are bein taken out

So what the fuck they want me to rap about?

About how happy I am, to be livin in the slum

where little shorties walk around totin big guns


[Chorus]


Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll


[Hard Black]

Nigga, nigga you think these rhymes?

You think they fuckin rhymes? This this this this PHILOSOPHY

This the end of redneck-ass catastrophes

Puttin a plunger in the, ass of my history!

Forty-one shots of reality for the generations to come after me!

As it be, hell hath no FURY like a black man scorned

Nigga BLAK IZ BLAK, you've officially been warned

Nigga - you've officially been warned

You hear me? You've you you've OFFICIALLY BEEN WARNED

You've been TOLD nigga, you've been fuckin OFFICIALLY been warned

This is for your dome, straight up

Shouldn't do and must do

And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot:

Put you on your boy's mind, real shit
Know what I'm talkin about?

[DJ Screw - Verse 1]
Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on a ledge, feel like I'm fallin off the edge
It ain't no fable, it's re-ali-ty
Feel like I'll move an your fizzin
they're tryin to tackle me, that's why I keep up the business
So relative or stranger, better keep yo' distance
I can't determine friend from foe so you in danger
Chemical inbalances of the weed and cocaine
But it really don't matter to society
A nigga that got no face an no name
Deservin more, but I'ma move until I ain't got nothin left
An the only thing that's promised to me is more povert and death
'cause there's some niggaz lookin for me an they might be near
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, Remember I'm a heavy here
Even still, gotta keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend don't understand
Don't want her to witness the wicked
so please find yourself another man... haters feel me

And if you bitches is scandilous, I get mad at ya
So I alleviate the pressure, don't try to run
I guarantee the slugs'll catch ya (hahahaha)
Oh yea, I keep some problem solvers
I'll pistol-whip my automatic and revolver, check it
An I'm a, ""hello bab-ay"", it's in my nature
This a must it ain't a maybe p.k.
The feds takin pictures and tappin my phones
But if I catch you bitches snitchin best believe me it's on
I analyze an visualize to open fire on bitches
And if I catch you bastards asleep I'm leavin bodies in ditches (huh?)
I'll bet they ask a bastard: ""feel like spendin a long one in a casket?""

[DJ Screw - Verse 3]
Everybody think I love keepin impulsive pride tappin
But I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rappin
See I know they want to get rich off of me, understand
Even if I was to die I would still rep talk, they'd still put a mic in my hand
Quit tryin to cover my style of life, pretendin like they from my block
But I survive from willin to live while they depend on war and talk
Before you make your move, check yourself and give 'er in front of me
Even if lyrical strugglin, adjust your ticket 'cause you know how dead your gonna be
There's gon' be a dentist to see
When a nigga be screamin and hollarin ""I'm yo' Godfather""
But I guess it's just the menace in me
Plus, the only nigga that's keepin me from clickin is Herman Fisher
We don't care 'cause to kid us he'll get us a drink and infinite burnin swishers
Why they want to play with my life? they got families, nigga I don't
The only thing between me an them hoes is I'ma keep thuggin they timid ass home
But they mind they own goddamn business, and keep theyself outta mine
Because of a thin line between livin they business and boo-yah!

DJ Screw,"Verse 1

Mack 10 nutty as they come 
leave 'em face down
and numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
rollin' down a one way
in my 'lac front and back
over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
it get's on my nerves
banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Chorus

Foe life foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
(Repeat)

Verse 2

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
with my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
a lot of stiches in the ass
blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go
and if he say no I'ma have to say
bitch get out the car slow
and leave ya fuckin' dough
'cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Chorus

Verse 3

Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
my momma want to know why I do what I do
'cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
with no serial number it's the summer
where niggas die
It's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
and try to guess the color of my shoelaces

Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West 
With plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't trying to go to war
The common denominator in the sitution 
is barre like a star you can shine with 
Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
c'mon and try to leave your mind with me
Steady be sellin, celebratin, for payin our dues
With so much drank in my cup the soda water don't even move
I's a playa can't associate with the plexin
Bone hard, bitch, Mo City, Texas
And a veteran don't get me wrong cause put you a glass
Pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass
Take a chill pill bill
Blow some kill pop the steal
Since we won't ba seen 
Sippin syrup till we leave 
From the dirty-third coast it ain't no roach a G
So fill your cup up to the brim and have a toast with me

Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard

All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town

Blaze up the indo, light the chocolate tye
Sittin' on South Race screens, ballin' out the sky
Hoes diss that ass cause they want to buy me Ralph Lauren
Cause big 'o 19's look lovely on the foreign
I ain't borrowing, the baddest, the V-12 is the baddest
A rhymin' afterattics gave me superstar status
Longers get my list, haters got me pissed
I used to sell rocks, now they all on my wrist
Feel this before yourself, step and get in this
The playa, the pimp, young thug and a menace
Pretendness is endless, and crank up confusion
Yo sweet cal is used in knockin' out Houston

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town

Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Screwed-Up Click for life, this is Lil' to Keke

Two, is ballin' in the mix
And hit me on the beep if you need thirtysix
Quickly, we're the grands of high rexis
I'll make you mighty reckless to run up on the Lexus
It's still this game from a Southern gangbanger
No anger to a stranger, but it's one up in the chamber
Of the blared straight glock cause haters come in flocks
It don't face born and raised on the 8100 block of Herschelwood
And the point is understood
We keep it all good in this crack-controlled hood
It ain't too late to set it straight, real players don't hate
Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break
500 mean gold, tapes sold, story told, from the North to South Pole
21 years old, want to bone, won't drown
Just another pimp comin' out that H-Town

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town

Southside representin' and this is Lil' to Keke

First three, who it be, L-i-l K-e
That's me, I'm a g, from the southside of the T
You and me, baby, let's get a room for the hour
Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the showers
You gone with the wind, after while it's on again
This time bring a friend, a couple corners we gone bend
Let's pretend that this sin, ain't even been committed
Once I split it then I hit it, you in love, go'on admit it
It's goin' down, yeah I'm talking to you
H-Town, smoked out jammin' Screw
Tell your crew it's '97, it ain't no refusin'
We got 'em to the bottom now they all lovin' Houston

A mufucka wonder what I'll do
Kill you bitch, pop-pop a lot
Youth or ancient, what's the deal?
Southside it's a new era, knoimsayin?
Put you on your boy's mind, real shit
Know what I'm talkin about?

[DJ Screw - Verse 1]
Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on a ledge, feel like I'm fallin off the edge
It ain't no fable, it's re-ali-ty
Feel like I'll move an your fizzin
they're tryin to tackle me, that's why I keep up the business
So relative or stranger, better keep yo' distance
I can't determine friend from foe so you in danger
Chemical inbalances of the weed and cocaine
But it really don't matter to society
A nigga that got no face an no name
Deservin more, but I'ma move until I ain't got nothin left
An the only thing that's promised to me is more povert and death
'cause there's some niggaz lookin for me an they might be near
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, Remember I'm a heavy here
Even still, gotta keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend don't understand
Don't want her to witness the wicked
so please find yourself another man... haters feel me

Shot call tonight, you rolling with the Boss Hoggs

No chain today but I'm a pull out the watch
You know I'm iced out (bling!)lookin like a wedding cake
I hear niggas whisperin man I bet its fake
But I got cash ride around in drop Jags
With my top back interior all black
With leather seats rimmed up 4 times
I'm in the V-12 watch me blow down
You know me I gotta put my stunt down
And when the laws pass by I put my blunt down
Cause I stay high like a telophone pole
And I roll on vogues and pimp yellow bone hoes
Swangas and blades is what we sit on
I'm talking on my ""flip phone"", ya get it ""flip phone""

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

DJ Serg,"Verse One: Gift of Gab 
Sittin on top of the bay, watchin the tide 
It's time to break the tension away, come take a ride 
As you enter the dimension of the crew SoleSides 
it ain't nuttin goin on but a party 
Now brothers want to flex but I'm over they heads 
I got the funky type of style to rip your vocals to shreds 
I'm never runnin from the Feds wearin red Pro Keds 
Cause -- I ain't did nuttin to no-BODY! 
I dedicate that line to Shack from South Central 
Not sayin I'm the baddest but I know I got potential 
For every black man hung lyrically I lynch you 
Your style is kinda dry hope my melody can quench you 
My soul is one with all although my ego is against you 
See rap is a raw meat, so now I got to mince you 
I'm playin rappers out like an old pair of gym shoes 
I can do anything, I can do anything 
Crusin down the street in my six-four Impala 
Is what I'd like to be doin if only I had the dollars 
A baller ain't a baller if he ain't got balls 
A scholar ain't a scholar if he ain't got scho-lastic 
education, and if not that, then learn from life 
Beyond all of the material crap 
A human ain't a human if he doesn't make mistakes 
And the name of this song is Swan Lake 
Verse Two: 
A planet ain't a planet if it don't have wars 
A battle ain't a battle if you don't catch scars 
A mind that ain't inquisitive really doesn't got 
shit to live for if you can't explore the 
realms of thought you ought not test lest 
you be chomped up, like a pop rock, stopped for a 
bead from the weed lady, thought it was the bomb 
Really wasn't nuttin but a bag of strong palms 
Lost twenty dollars, didn't get high 
Maybe next time I use my finances right 
Live another day, learn another lesson 
Ain't no need to get my mental status cold stressin 
that it's so ill that it's fo'-real that it's 
no skill displayed, de shades gone now 
So it's time to build my own umbrella 
Tell it tell her hella mellow fellows loungin 
Better bread I never fled a header of the sounds and 
all I want to do is run my own universe 
Grab the mic and let my spirit just FLOCK when I croon a verse 
Mind over matter, spirit over mind 
A doobie and a skin funky breakbeats and rhymes 
A true blue homey to the end reminiscin with your 
sister in the living room gin 
A life with a plan nine acres on a land 
Building self by yourself helpin out a fellow man 
Prepare for the essence when your inner soul's free 
Before the departure plantin of the right seed 
I think what everybody's strivin for is peace of mind 
I'm thinkin the world is full of inner places that are out there to 
find 
Manipulated minds need to make an escape 
And the name of this song is Swan Lake 
Manipulated minds need to make an escape 
And the name of this song is Swan Lake

Look down upon yourself
Until you're inside o' yourself
Look to the front or the back o' yourself

To the back or front of yourself
It's inside yourself
And then you see your own head
And know yourself is yourself

'Cause when you find yourself
You're gonna find that yourself is only yourself
And the self that can only be yourself
So when you're infront of the back of yourself
You're gonna find that your mind is in the centre of yourself
And God is nothing but yourself

And when you reach for yourself
You'll know that yourself
Is the only thing
That can happen to yourself
So that nothing can put you down

Won't lie and say this love is best
Leave us in emotional peace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No, take a rest

I see you digging a hole
Your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
No need to live on the need to
Your troubles must be seen to see through money
Like it's paper with faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it seldom cools my temper
It never cools my temper

Walking through the suburbs they're not exactly lovers
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, and then you wait for the next Kuwait

Don't want to be on top of your list

We overcome in 60 seconds
With the strength we have together

When there's trust there'll be treats and
When we funk we'll hear be beats

Watch out (repeated)
LB: 	In the beginning men and women had an obligation to their children
Lateef: Then there was a real and true necessity in need for building
LB: 	There was still the discipline and will proliferate the lineage
Lat: 	Matters of the spirit, mind, and body taken serious
LB:	But the way that we became what we became
 	Somebody please explain
Lat: 	Well we could tell you if you're curious
 	Those that reign got the masses in chains
 	And their minds enslaved
Both: 	And that's the part that makes me furious

Watch out (repeated)
Both: 	Cos they're definitely ain't no info readily avai'
 Lable to the general A (?) people so let me know x2

Lat: 	It's easily this multimedia crews that feed you to the neediest
 It's the greediest trying to cheat us out of our God given right
LB: 	To a quality education minimal opportunities available
 Limited occupations we are not given a choice
Lat: 	Or given a voice within a political system pimped and gangsta'd out
 Wherein the people are the victim sheep being lead about
LB: 	While the followers and the patrons of any faith outside the mainstream
 Are being raided, falsely painted as endangering the way things work
Lat:	And the way things are remain
LB:	I can't believe that things ain't worse
Lat: 	When all the wicked seeds we've sown have grown
LB: 	And poisoned all the Earth
Lat: 	It serves us right
LB: 	Can't really act surprised when the harvest has no worth
Lat: 	The curse that's lurking round the corner
Both: 	Is the product of our work

Watch out (repeated)
Right now
LB: 	The holy war's growing opposing forces polling of the origins
 Of which have been historically been ignored
Right now
Lat: 	Our foreign policy is mallets of democracy
 Upholding an aristocracy of secret terrorist cells
Right now
LB: 	The global poverty that we accept so commonly
 Turns people into property one step away from hell
Right now
Lat: 	Healthcare battles bioengineering for the worldwide scare
 Of the plague the we're fearing
Right now
LB: 	They got the right to put our lives under surveillance
Right now
Lat: 	They got the right to lock us up we don't obey them
Right now
LB: 	Modern education don't prepare the youth
Right now
Right now
Both: 	Do what you gotta do
Right now
LB: 	There's people shooting at people that's throwing stones
Right now
Lat: 	There's a movement of people across the globe
Right now
Both:	Right now is where we're at

Now-a-days, the range ain't big enough
Moskino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out
But my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough
Label said its not enough, singing in the hook
I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay, so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't floss enough
And I still ain't lost enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough, about crack sales and jail
Yall feeling me like braill, well I still got no sales
Must ain't soul enough, 'cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was ""Born 2 Roll"", but they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't west coast enough
But that's fine 'cause I'm gon' focus on mine
And hoping that two-thousand-nine is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game is a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers

[Chorus]
Somebody, tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggaz got to know it's for real

Niggaz only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface, nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough, we gon' start calling you bluff
Watching your moves, we gon' be, all in your stuff
Fuck around then come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price, niggaz is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggaz ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, no one stresses
Project girls rock vesses, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire burn
Enough dough get made, not of it earned
Enough wildin', fuck that yo, enough smilin'
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough teks
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks

[Chorus]

Enough if this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations set enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggaz on it
When we get in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggaz from the Brook', look
Enough cats with crack moes and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers, are lost entertainers
They found on billboards, greatest sale gainers
Enough beans and Benz, enough fly honies  with dime friends
That want to juice you for you ends
It's getting rough, a whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime though, like McGruff, enough's enough

Don't talk in your sleep
You gotta be so careful

He never was asleep at night
He knew every little short cut
He did everything right

DJ Shadow,"In the twilight of a time
There emerges a need for man to comprehend his own bitter fate
Finally resigned to the inevitable beyond, he searches the ages
Desperate for stories of assurance, redemption and hope

Such tales fill page upon page with enough ink
To flood a thousand valleys, and drown the tallest tree
But there is one tale that as yet been told
The story of... The Outsider

Desolate and baron, humanities at a crossroads
The people have retreated shuttering their once carefree lives
From unseen enemies which seem to plague not only the physical form
But the innermost thought

Driven by panic, compelled by dread
The masses begin to devolve
Once dear neighbours turn wary foes
Brother against brother, sister against sister

Achievement and ambition are dismissed
As heretical, or worse, treasonous
Even nature itself is scorned
Choked with suspicion and fear
Voices do not dare to sing
Nor fingers to play
Imminent defeat is all but assured

But in the darkest hour
Whispers begin to tell of a figure emerging from the darkness
A being without a name, faceless and obscure
Part presence, part idea they say
As if the very force they describe has existed for eons
A dormant seed awaiting nourishment
Word of radical acts...
Disobedience, non-compliance spread among the people
At first fearful, then defiant, as the legend grows
Whispers turned to cries and the cries into screams
And tend to cower no more the fury of the people
Whose talent behold as they exact revenge on their captors
Spare neither the repentant nor the bold

Now the fire is lit, smouldering in the belly of humanity
It cannot be extinguished, for the stories The Outsider endure
Even as evidence of its presence is debated with the passing years

Messages, dictations, warnings
Stories, such as these...",Outsider (Intro),2006

I speak from the heart
I fear beginning
I must go
Broken and soaked
To the wider world returning
I'll never be sullen again
Something is wrong
I can't stop my thoughts
I tell myself to stop them

Stop, stop what you're doing
I guess I'd better face it

Standing in a meadow
Looking out into the sky

And hundreds (and hundreds)
And hundreds of butterflies

That's all I can remember

Dance with light
Send stars to the night

Silent cries
The shadows surround us

So we crawl out from under
The water, out of darkness
(We're almost home, no sleep, no, girl)

Look around, don't stare
Into the light too long
(There's nothing here to see
(Ain't seen nothing)

Frozen hands on the window
Crying out in your sleep

Look away now, look away now
(I never said that you were falling to pieces)
(I know the thought that
(We would never get out of this)

Now the time that falls into the cracks
(There's nothing here to see

No philanthropist
For the scandalous
Drink a can of piss
My manuscript
Can turn an evangelist to satanist
I'm faded with this
Struggle with one another
For faith in it
Devilish acts
Praying I get away with it
Sitting waiting patient
Taking everything that's sacred
Even your imagination
Can't think when you're in hell
'Bout to lose everything
Like Jack and Jill's pail
Got a nigga's brain captured
Like SeaWorld whales
I'm a nigga from the hood
I can see the world well
That's why I get fucked up
'Cause I can't lift up the veil
Looking in the mirror like I love myself
That's why I get fucked up
'Cause I can't lift up the veil
So I look in the mirror say I love myself

Full of structure
Full of color
Starry sky

As the moon suspending in my night

It´s breathing life
Looking thru the window glass
I see a glimpse of heaven
And it´s so beautiful

It hides a nasty stain that's lying there

I'm what the games been missing
What you about to witness is something that you haven't been witness'in
I'm what the games been missing",Intro,
DJ Slack,"Verse one:

Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When i heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on 
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd

Imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger everytime I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric be	 is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

Move the crowd",Move the Crowd [Beatmix by Democratic 3],1987
DJ Smallz,"[Chorus: x4]
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'ma get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggas under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

[Chorus: x4]

It ain't no lying or fiction, up in me please
I don't exaturrate the price, it was fifteen G's
When they ask, about the colored diamonds in the piece
Yeah I'm one of the richest, southern niggas in these streets
Yeah I'm candy flipper, you can have a picture
While I pose like a playa, by the candy with ya
Koopa never have no time, for no panty pinchers
My nigga, how come you ain't take me to Miami with ya
It's a couple haters out there, that won't let me be
I feel like yelling F' the radio, like SPC
The movie room in my crib, got a empty sweet
I'm with Sway, I'm getting interviewed by MTV
Yeah I'm ill at rapping, but I'm still not capping
Ain't touched a damn drug, and he still ain't trapping
I don't change don't sleep, cause Chamil' ain't napping
Stop acting like platinum, with Chamil' can't happen
I'm a Northside rider, ain't got to worry
Cause the major deal, is not about to turn me
Yeah the controversy, ain't about to hurt me
I don't play no games, like I forgot my jersey
Still ride around the city, with none of my niggas with me
Still ride for H-Town, if don't none of these niggas feel me
Ain't gotta like me, or have none of these niggas hit me
I'm a be the M-V-P, if don't none of these niggas pick me
A lot of rumors in the streets, ain't none of it really pretty
Getting money, makes all of the drama seem itty-bitty
Pick a click, I don't hang with none of these niggas really
But I'm glad that the majors, is running up in the city cause I'm

[Chorus: x4]

Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, boy tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

[Chorus: x4]

Blucker-blucker-blucker, that's how my gun go
If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done, who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggas, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth

[Chorus: x4]",From the South,2005
DJ Smallz,"Hold up

Hold up
Self-employed so I'm paying me
Stayin' true 'cause it stay to be
Won't loud part candy captain then get a ticket then pay the V
Rap 84 of the 83, ain't rhyme them and they end with me, 
How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face
All the sinners star calling God, 
All the rappers start calling Mace, 
Drop sounding like an earthquake, 
Trunk bound to make an earth shake
Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day
Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they've been calling me, 
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Soon they see roll up, uh, roll up, 
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

[Chorus]

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

[Chorus]",Hold Up,2005
