that's what her eyes are 
that's what I am today 
And if I had it all to do 
All over again 
I wouldn't of waited to say

I can't live without you 

I don't want nobody else 

Baby listen very closely

I couldn't lie 

She couldn't wait 

I love you came too late 

I'd give my life for yesterday 

I love you came too late 



I should of seen the signs 

Paid more attention 

But I pushed her love away 

So if she finds someone to give her 

What she needed 

Somebody else not afraid to say

I can't live without you

If I had another chance 

I'd shout it out to you 

The words I Love you

The things we used to do 
I can't get over you

Don't you ever wish 
You were someone else

You don't like the way you are

Just open up your heart 
And let it show you the way

I love you more than ever
I can't say it any better
So I had to put it in a love song

And if I never took the time to say
What I am feeling deep inside today

We'd fall from the graces
I'd try to sing your praises
But I'm sure I'd just get the words wrong

But a fool can have her charms

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

Saturday night and the moon is out. 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
when it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
out in the middle of a big dance floor.
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more.
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight.
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
never have drifted down a bayou stream.
But I heard that music on the radio,
and I swore someday I was gonna go:
down a highway 10 past Lafayett;
there's a Baton Rouge.
and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets

Ya deja de llorar y vamos dilo
Que te vas, que me dejas, que ya no vale la pena
Intentarlo de nuevo, que murió
Yo sé, tu eres mariposa que vuela, buscando libertad
Y yo un moribundo sin esperanzas, sabiendo que te vas
Y quizás ahora ya no nos queda nada
Pero ahora amor de mi vida si te vas, quiero decirte

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Que diosito te acompañe
Y que te vaya bien, vaya bien

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Dejándome aquí, así
Moribundo
Moribundo

Siempre tu serás mi princesa
Bien suave, suavecito como seda
Ojos achinados como una muñeca
Y me hipnotizan tan solo con su belleza
Pero ya no voy a sufrir por ti
Consíguete otro man que lo hará por mi
Se acabó el amor que yo tenia para ti
Ya me cansé de rogarte

Pero dime baby cuál es tu falsedad
Pero dices que me amas y por qué te marchas
Me acusas de maltrato y de infidelidad
Pero todo eso es mentira, nada de eso es de verdad

Te ciegas con las mentiras de tus amigas
Pero ellas no te dicen que conmigo quieren estar
En lo más profundo de tu alma, sé que me amas
Después que estés feliz, te juro viviré en paz

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Que diosito te acompañe
Y que te vaya bien, vaya bien

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Dejándome aquí, así

Ya no hacen falta las palabras
Cuando esa mirada tuya, dice que te vas
Y yo aquí solo en la nada
Imaginando en lo que pudo ser
Y nunca será, que te vas tú y me quedo yo
A nadie obliga a nadie a quererse
Me tocó perder, pero no hay rencor
Yo te deseo buena suerte

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Que diosito te acompañe
Y que te vaya bien, vaya bien

Ojalá que lo que busques
Valga más de lo pierdes
Dejándome aquí, así
(Jah rasta far ih)

Me duelen los días si no estás 
Todo lo que intento sale mal 
Ando sin rumbo y dirección 
Dime, tú sin mí, si te va mejor 

No puedo mentirle al corazón 
Desde que no estás no sale el sol 
Yo te extraño, me hace daño el estar sin ti 
Vuelve, por favor 

Todavía yo, yo sigo amándote, sigo extrañándote 
Volvamos hoy, hoy, hoy 
Volvamos hoy, hoy, hoy 
Volvamos hoy, baby, para volver a ser feliz 
Todavía yo, yo sigo amándote, y mucho más que ayer 
Volvamos hoy, hoy, hoy 
Volvamos hoy, hoy, hoy 
Volvamos hoy, baby, para volver a ser feliz 

Qué quieres que diga, mami 
Lo que me está pasando a mí 
Es que tu adiós fue como un tsunami que todo derrumbó, nena 
Besar otros labios se siente fatal 
Todas las canciones me hacen recordar 
Que fui tan feliz y ahora nada es igual 
No hay, baby 

Dime si me amas a mí como te amo yo a ti 
Olvidémoslo todo y volvamos 
Dime si me amas a mí como te amo yo a ti 
Olvidémoslo todo y volvamos 

Todavía yo, yo sigo amándote, sigo extrañándote 
Volvamos hoy, hoy, hoy

¿Como sucedió?, no sé 
Si en mi planes no tenía enamorarme 

¡Sebastián Yatra! 
Pero yo te vi tan sola 
Y como yo vine solo, no lo pensé 
Y decidí acercarme a ti

Cuando te vi, vi, vi 
Supe que tú eras para mí, mi, mi 
Y es que a me gustas sólo tú, tú, tú 
Tenemos cosas en común, baby

Salí pa' la calle sin rumbo 
No estaba en mis planes enamorarme de ti 
Pero no pasó ni un segundo 
Entraste a mi mundo y en tus ojos me perdí 

Baby, no sé cómo fue que te metiste en mi cabeza 
Pero finalmente yo he encontrado a mi princesa 
La que sabe dominarme cuando me besa
Canta el coro que otra vez empieza

No son como lo tuyo, me saben amargos

Porque todas las canciones me hablan de ti

Joey Pearson,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

When I was down you just stood there grinnin'
You got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend

You say I let you down, you know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason that you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street, you always act surprised
You say, 'how are you, good luck,' but you don't mean it
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
Now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
Can't you understand that's not my problem

Well I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You know what a drag it is to see you

Pressed against the window pain,

Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,

Joey Tempest,"They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change,
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.

The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change,
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.

Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

When I come back you'll be my wife.

But someone was waiting
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waiting
It just didn't feel right.

Strangers on my back

Maybe I should surrender
Maybe I should give it up

Someone's at your side

Find me the treasure where the legend lies.

If I were a noble ancient knight
I'd stand by jour side to rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name.

Ninja survive, in dreams I walk by your side
Ninja survive, with you there's no need to hide.

I've gone through pain

Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want.

Do you want to be loved by me, by me 

The kind of looks that never lie 
If I wasn't crazy Id lose my mind 
The kind of looks go underneath 
Makes a dirty mind come clean 
Out of breath feeling fine 
Thinking straight but I'm out of line 
All the looks I have returned 
Now I can never close my eyes 

Do you want to be loved by me 
Or we can always lust 
Do you want to be loved by me

And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Across my dreams with nets of wonder

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name

Oh I heard the angels singing

Just when I thought my soul was lost
I heard the angels singing
My dungeon was shook, my chains dropped off
I heard them singing
The people come running, saying what's it all about
I heard the angels singing
The holy ghost hit me, I could not help but shout
I heard the angels singing

I heard the angels singing to me

Je chante pour ne pas oublier
Je chante aussi pour supporter
Les peines, les larmes que je croise
Le temps qui marque les visages
Les larmes dans les yeux des autres j'aimerais les sécher.
Moi je passe mon temps à combattre le vent
Pour ne pas changer de direction
Si bien souvent, je sais ce qui m'attend
Une route chargée de victoires
Et de déceptions
Mais je tape dedans
Toujours droit devant, même s'ils veulent m'empêcher de tourner en rond
Depuis trop longtemps moi je serre les dents
Trop de baltringues, trop de bouffons
Trop de stars en carton
Ici tu dois trouver ta place
Tout faire pour que jamais ils ne t'effacent
J'bouge travaille, transpire et me déplace
Pour pas m'retrouver coincée dans un sas
J'fais ma musique pèpère, j'esquive les crasses
Dans ce biz ne me dit pas qu't'es efficace
J'aime pas quand ils pissent là ou je passe
Dans ce couloir on marche tous la tête basse
J'veux pas m'fondre dans la masse
Donne moi un micro pour qu'j'travaille
Pour qu'ils n'oublient pas ma face
Leur fashion me dépasse le micro mon arme fatale mes lyrics, mon famasse
J'aime quand la basse frappe qu'elle te tabasse
Etre sur scène, voir que des foules s'amassent
Bien longtemps que j'ai fait mes classes
J'livre bataille, j'ai semé mes grains et maintenant je les ramasse.
On ne court pas après les mêmes choses
C'est toujours les mêmes qu'ils exposent
Prêts à accepter tout ce qu'on leur impose

This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son

Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Joeystarr,"Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle

La rime toujours franche
Rien à cacher dans mes manches
Je suis devant ma page blanche
Faut pas que mon flow flanche
J'ai ce sentiment de plénitude, toujours constant
Une impression de sur-vital, se réactivant
Tous les jours je joue à fond le rôle de ma vie
J'me sens comme une poussière, sur l'échelle du temps infini
Pas besoin d'exagérer la réalité d'opérer qui me fait perdre le fil
Je joue mon rôle sans faire semblant de découvrir la lune
Même si comme activiste je fais figure de poids-plume
Je ne compte pas secourir, mais au moins soulager
Seul l'éveil des consciences dans ma musique est beauté

Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle ...

Je cherche souvent à brûler mes sentiments
Et me laisse toujours pas apprivoiser, comme ça par le temps
Mes yeux rêvent en stoppant net chaque soir l’illusoire
Mais je me fous d'être raisonné c'est ce qui me tient à l'écart
J'ai l'esprit d'un chieur, j'suis un chieur prodige
J'suis prêt à tous les combats, c'est ça qui m'guide
Chaque jour, je vois le monde défiler devant moi
Et j'me rend compte que j'suis meilleur danseur que le Diable, crois-moi
Mon rôle, critiquer d'une ambition minimale, il me faut vivre avec et chaque seconde est primordiale
Mais je nourris un plus grand rêve pour défier le Réel
Avec le radin libertaire pour qu'il me pousse des ailes

Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle...


De plus en plus les gens me reconnaissent
Plus je parle, moins il me connaissent
A fleurs de mots et de gimmicks
Je n’imite personne, on veut que je milite
Je ne combat pas des logos
Ma cause est mignonne
Lecture pour tous les mômes
Je ne pense qu'aux innocents
Aux femmes qui chantent en pilotant
Le but, coller en une phrase les ingrédients de l'extase
On sait peu de choses qu'on ignore
Tout corbeau ne fini pas rossignol
Métaphore métaphysique, métamorphose du bruit en musique
On pousse nos crew et stars
Vous n'êtes pas monsieur Starr?

Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle...",Mon Rôle,2011
Joeystarr,"Trop tard
Oli, Bigflo, Jaguar

Elle avait toujours été seule avant d'le rencontrer
Coup d'foudre, elle s'était pas trompée
Elle nous disait ""l'amour est mort"", s'empêchait d'y croire
Elle était jeune, lui avait déjà eu des histoires
Comme un nouveau départ, elle lui donnait d'l'espoir
Elle était fière d'nous raconter sa première fois
C'est vrai qu'il est attachant, de bonne humeur et quand j'y pense
En son absence, y avait beaucoup moins d'ambiance
Elle lui donnait confiance, finie la jolie renfermée
Choquée devant ses danses, elle était transformée
C'était son meilleur pote, son amour, son anti-ennui
Il l'avait changé, elle pouvait plus sortir sans lui
Il était dur avec elle et lui montait à la tête
Et certains soir elle nous mentait pour le retrouver en cachette
Et moi j'le trouvais saoulant j'lui aurait bien dis ""fous l'camp!""
Elle avait foi en lui et elle en parlait tout l'temps
J'aurais du voir qu'ça allait pas, non ça allait pas
Elle l'avait dans l'sang pour lui elle s'mettait dans des sales états
Beau parleur, un bon dragueur, un charmeur un étalon
À force de courir après lui, elle s'est cassé les talons
Elle buvait ses paroles, voyait plus personne
Répondait plus à sa daronne
Nan mais tu t'rends compte? L'amour ça rend con
Dans son regard on lisait l'regret d'leur première rencontre
Pour nous trop dur à avaler on la voyait elle était pâle
Elle s'était fait balader par l'cavalier d'son dernier bal
Elle restait belle mais qu'est-ce qu'elle était mal
Il lui a jamais rendu visite à l'hôpital

Elle nous disait toujours pareil, qu'elle arrêterait d'le voir
Elle nous l'a dit trop de fois
Il lui remplissait les oreilles avec toutes ses histoires
On l'a compris trop tard
Elle nous disait toujours pareil, qu'elle arrêterait d'le voir
Elle nous l'a dit trop de fois
Il lui remplissait les oreilles avec toutes ses histoires
On l'a compris trop tard

Hmhm, trop tard

Trop tard, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Trop tard
C'était déjà trop tard
Elle nous disait toujours pareil (tout le temps)
Elle nous disait toujours pareil (tout le temps)

C'était l'ex d'un pote, il lui à présenté
Il lui a dit ""fais attention tu pourrais t'laisser tenter""
Mais dès qu'elle est rentré dans la pièce elle est rentré dans son cœur
Elle avait des beaux yeux verts avec un parfum de fleur
Lui qu'avait perdu l'espoir qu'un jour l'amour l'accompagne
Il venait de la ville elle venait de la campagne
Au début d'leur histoire ils étaient beaux à voir
Il l'avait dans la poche dès l'départ
Ensemble ils pouvaient rester des heures couchés dans l'herbe
À regarder le ciel, elle lui disait ""il faut te détendre"", il lui disait ""je t'aime""
Elle était belle au naturel, dès qu'elle était pas là il avait plus d'air
Elle lui disait des mots doux du bout des lèvres, avec tous les potes elle était populaire
Elle lui donnait le tournis
C'était la seule fille qui lui donnait le sourire
Il traînait avec elle tout le temps, tout le temps
Elle lui répétait ""fais doucement, doucement""
Elle le suivait partout, ils allaient jusqu'au bout
Il voulait dormir avec elle au lieu de sortir avec nous
Elle l'avait changé, il avait les yeux cernés
Il passait la journée chez lui avec les volets fermés
Elle lui faisait oublier sa vie d'merde
Lui qui avait connu pas mal de doute
Et un beau jour bercé par la vitesse
Il s'est endormi sur la route

Il nous disait toujours pareil, qu'il arrêterait d'la voir
Il nous l'a dit trop de fois
Elle lui remplissait les oreilles avec toutes ses histoires
On l'a compris trop tard
Il nous disait toujours pareil, qu'il arrêterait d'la voir

And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

Today is gonna be the day
It's in the air
I suppose, no one's really got a clue
Why you are here
Just a face in the crowd

Can you play that game tonight?
Tomorrow will be different
It's a simple fact
When you're named
There is no one around the world
Who goes and stopping you

And you know that
'Cause you're faster than a bullet
From a loaded gun
It's in your hand
Come and get it on

Everybody knows
This is your finest hour
A shooting star
That's what you are
This is your time

It's the final dance
Now this could be the moment
You were waiting for
Take your chance
Don't let it slip away now

You're almost there
You step into the light
Steady gun in your hand
Come and get it done

Everybody knows
This is your finest hour
A shooting star
That's what you are
This is your time

The party has ended
With a shock
Now look at you
What have you done?

Everybody knows
This is your finest hour
A shooting star
That's what you are
This is your time
When I all comes down

Everybody knows
This is your final hour
A shooting star
That's what you are

Johan,"Well, it's was kind of windy
Suddenly appeared, this guy
He was the very spin of me
Got it all, it's all I ever wanted to be

Now don't you worry sick, I'm on a hurry
Just do some things for me and I would
'Cause after all it was all I ever wanted to be

And you can be like me
If you just do what I tell you
And I will set you free
That's what he told me
Right before he left off

It's getting out of hand
I thought he was a friend
He's gone and they
All mistake me for him

And you were wrong
Another man you're searching for
Now I was wanted for
Crimes he had committed
Before I knew it, they got me locked up
Another one, another million searching for

And you can count on me
When you think you have to run
And you can lean on me
That's what he told me

Now he's gone, there's something wrong
He was gone, just way out of sight
We will know tonight

And you can count on me
When you think you've had too much
And you can lean on me
That's what he told me

Now he's gone, he is gone
There's something wrong
He is just way out of sight
We will know tonight
He is gone, something's wrong
He was just way out of sight

He was taken a ride
He was gone, he was way out of sight
He was gone, he was gone, he was gone

",He's Not There,1997
Johan,"Well, the car broke down somewhere near Memphis
About another forty miles to go
Here we were stranded in the middle of nowhere
We were freezing in the falling snow

And if we only had a map or compass
'Cause I haven't got the faintest idea
Which way to go

Now should we walk and then in what direction
Or do we stay inside this wrecked machine?
Or should we try to find a petrol station
And make a fire with the gasoline?

And if we only had some food or water
'Cause I haven't got the faintest idea
Which way to go

After a week we were getting real hungry
Sick and tired of playing guitar
A truck drove by, this unlucky guy
We prepared him for dinner and took his car

So we hit the road and headed for the city
When we got there, no one said a word
Here we were sitting looking at each other
With a question mark above our heads

And if we only had a reason to be here
'Cause I haven't got the faintest idea
What I'm doing in here

",Payment,1997
Johan,"Hey,
I can remember what you told me yesterday
You said you're leaving me, I'm mad, but please don't stay
I forgot the way you looked when I told you I was hooked on you
Well, it was a lie
I am not the one that makes you sad, it's not my style

Can you recall how many times I didn't say
Want to shoot a second, but you never listen
What could it be, it was supposed to be this way.
You can't read between the lines
Are you stupid or just blind, cause I'm already gone
I don't need this anymore, I feel better than before
So long

You can make me cry
Can you make me smile one more time
And I'll be satisfied
A million lies
Do you know you make me feel alright
You make me feel alright

All you love is all you'll ever have
Keep your brother like it's you
And repell the fake until they're true

Anyone could be your friend
Trust and they will trust you back again

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved

The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be,

As long as life endures

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace

We've no less days to sing God's praise

Where human hearts are staunch and true; I shall start my life anew.

Where I may find there are hearts more kind than I leave behind. 
And so I go to fight the savage foe, 
Although I know that I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.

In some Abyssinian, French dominion I shall do my bit, 
And fall for the flag if I must.

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!

In a one-horse open sleigh.

Take the girls tonight

I'm not going to beg just say please, please, please
Be good to me

This happens to all of us
Apparently I'm not good enough
I can't make you laugh like Tangerine

that proves that I love you dear""

Johanne Blouin,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2000
Johanne Blouin,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2000

Bevor sie auf mich fall'n, reiß ich die Mauern ein.
Komm steh' auf, komm steh' auf, sag ich mei'm Verstand
Und gibt es keine Tür, dann geh' ich halt durch die Wand.

Das alles muss weg, das alles muss neu.

Wie auf einer Planke stehen, den Dolch im Rücken, die Hände gefesselt und beide Füße in Beton
Dann spreng die Ketten hier und stell dir vor die schlechte Zeit bleibt aus, du nimmst weit Reisaus

She's the promise of pearl in a pool of heartache
She's the perfect little truth wrapped in little white lies
Like the wind she will turn
She can state the case now and then
Ignore the truth
When it ain't on her side
When her eyes claim that she's a lady
You better treat her as such
But comfort the little girl when her world gets too rough

If she
If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her
If she's the woman you love

In the moment that your lives touched
There was something in the stars
That made you feel you'd probably die
Just for a good morning in her arms
'Cause you knew you'd seen an angel
And you were sure she'd fly away
But she chose you when she landed
And gave her heart away

So she's your mystery trip into each new tomorrow
She's the first to laugh and she's the worst to cry
She's like the tide 'neath your ship
But all the fall and rise is just a call to dance

And she's always in time
And her love is like a river in a poem
Penned in wine
That takes you floating forever rhyme after rhyme

If she
If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her
If she's the woman you love",If She,1994

The season for the rodeo is over
And he's usually back home this time of year
But I haven't heard a word since
He called me from Santa Fe
Something in his voice said you were stealing him away

New Mexico - have i lost him to your sunset
Do your mountains life him higher than my love
New Mexico - guess we'll have to wait and see
If tomorrow's gonna bring him back to me

He said he'd never seen a place more beautiful
And he talked of maybe moving there someday
Where the stars in the sky shine like diamonds every night
I wonder if he sees those stars in someone else's eyes

He's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying
He thinks he'll drown all the hurt that he's feeling inside
A river of tears is washing away her every reason for trying
And the distance between them is silence, anger and pride

They don't talk to each other
They're no longer lovers
They won't even say the three words that could keep love from dying
She needs a shoulder, he needs to hold her
But he's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying

He tells the bartender his problems and thanks him for listening
Then he orders more whiskey to have something warm he can hold
She picks up the phone, and calls up a friend, 
And says she wishes she knew what was missing 
Both of them ask the wrong people why their love's growing cold

They don't talk to each other

You say it must be a miracle
Your heart even beats at all
After all that you've been through
You fell for too many promises, every line
And it was you that always took the fall
I know you're hurtin but don't be sad
I'm here to tell you that you've just had

A string of bad love
But don't give up
One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough
Baby let me break the string of bad love

I've done some time on that trail of tears
And I swore I'd never love again so I know what you're going through
I fell in love with a heartbreaker every time
The road took another bend
I got over it, so will you
Have a little hope, you've just been through

So don't give up
One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough
Baby let me break the string of bad love

Together we could take a shot
At making a love that won't unwind
Maybe we could tie a know, in that

You've been tangled up and tied down long enough

Lookin' at this town through older eyes
It's grown much too fat to recognize
There's a freeway up and the park's torn down
There's not a soul that I know around

Has anybody seen Amy
In her tan bare feet on the summertime street
Can her kiss still turn the winter warm
Or is she just a figment of
What I recall of yesterday's love
Has anybody seen Amy anymore

I can't see the stars through the neon lights
But there's still a crowd where the boys hang out at night
The songs I hear from those teenage cars
Still got the beat but they've lost the heart

In her tan bare feet on the summertime street
Can her kiss still turn the winter warm

I couldn't figure out why she couldn't be found
There's only one lime green mustang in this cotton-pickin' town 
I've been a fool, there's no doubt

Or was every single moment just a lie

I think I'll call my Momma up and tell her the news

It's hour one
And it's a nightmare

And yet it's good to be alive

Cause the universe is not fair

Are fighting to survive

Child stay down, stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child stay down, stay down
You better shut your mouth

For our downfall
And we deserve it playing God
With our machines
Our religions are a prison
That's our fatal flaw
Bombs are flying
While we're sleeping with the enemy

Look at me, right at me
When I'm telling you to stay down
Come to me, run to me
I am begging you to stay down
Cling to me desperately
All you gotta do is stay down
Pay attention my child down

John Abercrombie,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

John Abernathy,"Listen while you read!
In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart

John Adams,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near

You don't realise
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away

You know she always thought pretty well of me
She said that the wedding went fine 
And you were up in New York on your honeymoon
Tonight I'm down, in Tennessee

I got that letter you wrote, it tore me up
But I don't have anyone to blame but me
I had it all for a while but like everything else
I messed it up
Tonight I'm down, in Tennessee

It's blue tonight and gettin' bluer
But I'm in the state that I deserve to be
Without you I just can't see things ever looking up for me 
I'm so down, in Tennessee

I hope you're happy with him, he's a lucky man
I hope he gives you that home and family
I just want to say if by chance you are ever this way, look me up
I'll be down, in Tennessee

John Anderson,"It all started at a corner table
Sippin' on a Jack and Coke
When the sun found us the next mornin'

We were actin' like married folk
The weekend, it weakened me
And drained me of my will, you got me

Goin' down hill, you got me goin' down hill
And still I can't get my fill of you

I've spent all my money
I've lost my respect

I stay just one step

Somebody's playing my song

And do the Cotton-Eyed Joe

And the breakfast they eat after closing time
Would make their mamas proud

",Christmas Time,1994
John Anderson,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,1994

Hottest thing I'd ever seen
Cotton dress clinging to her like a glove
It took all of a minute to fall in love

I'd a bet you a hundred that I'd never find
That one in a million
That one of a kind
I was standing still, spinning my wheels
When I came face to face with the real deal

You're gonna need some help, she said with a smile
Or, boy, you're gonna be here a while
If you pay for dinner we can call it square
I took her hand and we took it from there

I'd a bet you a hundred that I'd never find

Little girl pictures hung on the walls,
Now they're just memories gathering dust

Where has the little girl gone? It's the miracle part of the overall plan
Girl becomes woman and boy becomes man
Then they fall in love and have kids of their own
That's where the children have gone

Little league trophies and Lord only knows

But Herschel don't understand

He'll play that same sad song on the old jukebox
Drink up every dime he's got
He'll peel out in his pickup truck
Sling gravel through the parkin' lot

Or step on a copperhead snake
So if you cross his path you better beware

With no wax linoleum floors
Now his mama's all worried 'cause he don't drop by
To watch wrestling anymore
He just rides around with a loaded shotgun
Hangin' in his rifle rack
If I was that smooth talkin' city boy
I'd sure be watchin' my back

Cause I'm saving on a washer and a wedding ring
I want this love to be a lasting thing
Right at the top, that's where you rank

Oh, oh, you make me feel like a million bucks
Oh, oh, I oughta drive you around in an armored truck

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Some rice and three green peas

At a little roadhouse called the Get Down Here
A cinder block building with a hand-painted sign
Hunkered down straddling the county lines

When the crowd rolled in, they were a motley mix
There were truckers, bikers, drifters and locals from the sticks
Each one meaner than a cougar in a cage
And the biggest one swaggered right up to the stage

He said, “We've heard everybody from David Allen Coe
To Chuck Berry singing ""Go Johnny go go""
Got an autographed picture of Elvis on the shelf

No need to fuss, stop the squalkin', just let the guitar do the talkin'

Best lookin' thing seventeen miles
Sittin' there makin' my cold beer sweat
I figure my chances were a long shot bet

Because a woman like that's heard every line
And I never have been the silver-tongue kind
But I knew I had me one good chance of gettin' that girl to dance
So I cranked up my amp

And let the guitar do the talkin' and the whole place started rockin'
My fingertips weren't stoppin' and that dirty little thing started boppin'
No need to fuss and stop your squalkin' and let the guitar do the talkin'

And in a world of too many words

But I think I figured out a little way of getting mine through

Tryin' to fix a nightgown that the dog tore up

Brother got a broomstick and propped it back up
We could've had a dryer or a sewing machine
But daddy went and bought us a trampoline

And we jump on it every chance we get mama and daddy and all us kids
We ain't got much but we got this and we jump on it

And I never think of shooting my gun

Pop a top again

That's when my trouble begins

It was you who lied it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun we'll pay for our lies one by one

How can you face me after what you've done
You've shattered my dreams one by one
One by one...

How can you go to sleep at night don't know mem'ries make you long for daylight
You'll pay the price after having your fun you'll regret each mistake one by one

John Arch,"I've been living in the past 
Trying to live without you 
I can feel your presence here 
But I just can't touch you anymore 
Memories are all I have 
And your pictures fades from the light of another day 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 

Cheyenne, I am 
I am so far away 
Can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 

I've been looking to the west 
Where the silent man can hear the harmony 
Of the children's song and its sweet refrain 
I just can't hear it anymore 
Memories are all I have 
Of the sun and stars dancing endlessly 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 

Cheyenne, I am 
I am so far away 
can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 
I am, Cheyenne 
I am the sky, the wind, the rain 
In my dreams, my friend 
I can see you again 

Look behind my footprints in the sand 
This moment I stop to wonder 
Why I long for yesterday 
Tomorrow pulls me under 
All the while I wallow in the mire 
The moment just passed me by 
Sunrise, will you grace my eyes 
Bless my soul, make me whole again 

The voice of reason guides me home 
To the summit in the sky 
Where amber waves and endless days 
Celestial spheres catch our gaze 
Desperate cries prayers unanswered 
Angry are the faithless 
Who are they who left us here? 
The anthem loud the question is so very clear 
We stare into the stratosphere all alone 
All alone, all alone 

I am the salt of this lonely satellite 
A grain of sand the tide has washed ashore 
All I am 
All I am, nothing more

The words don't mean a thing anymore 
Forever more

John Arch,"I open my eyes, was that real or was I dreaming 
I don't hit the ground, but I'm falling forever 
I'm close to the edge and I want to just fly away 
To silence the voices, is this the only way? 

I bring you my dreams that inspire imagination 
They are nothing like yours, so I lock them away again 
I lie to myself and believe that I'm healing 
The higher I climb, the longer I fall 

Crossing over burning bridges 
There's nothing left of you inside my mind 
The hourglass is long and empty 
The time has come to break the chains of misery 
Crossing over burning bridges 
There's nothing left of you inside my mind 
The hourglass is long and empty 
The time has come to break the chains of misery 

I remember skipping rocks across still waters 
And I remember chasing colors flying through thin air 
And I remember the water shone my first reflection 
I can't forget always waiting, I was wishing you were there 
You were never, never there 

Primadonna, she was sleeping with a stranger again 
Godforsaken and the savior hanging on the bedroom wall 
Contradictions, they manifest such deep resentments in me 
Transparent one I'm not naive and you, you're not holier than thou 
Amen 

I'm inside you, I deny you 
I surround you, I defy you 
Hear the voices, they are godless 
No forgiveness, so relentless 

In the real world you feel real pain 
A never ending war inside, again and again 
Are you who you think you are, my life runs through your veins 
Try as you will, my son, try 
But you will not break the chains of misery 

I can feel anger rising like the sun rises every day that I'm here 
Now and then you return to open the wounds again and again",Relentless,2003

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
