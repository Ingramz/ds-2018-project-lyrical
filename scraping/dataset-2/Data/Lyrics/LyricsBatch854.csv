Pizzo,"Paula came from Washington with long golden hair
Twenty eight dollars in a fake silk purse and a leather skirt to wear
Shane came from Dublin town from the old world so green
Counterfeit ticket in to JFK in the land of his dreams

Street life's the only life they take a walk in the park
Even tough they only met that day they were lovers by dark
Laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand
He said listen babe we gotta take what's ours do it or die

Quit dreaming, this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming, this is real life baby

Way out on the dock that night, the colour is red
23rd victim of a gangland war takes his last breath
Outside the sister cried, she said the whole world's so mean
Heavyweight killer in the ring, turns killing machine

Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

All my love, you're my all
They way you move, you're in control
The way you talk, the way you dress
Your hands, your touch, your sweet caress.
All my love, you're the best,
Every little thing that I possess,
It's all emotion when you take control,
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
Oh my love, all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy,
If this going to kill us then let it go,
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream,
Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream.

Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
Your eyes, your lips, the shape of your mouth,
It's a sweet life baby
All my love, you're my all
The way you move, the way you go
I'm all emotion when you take control
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
All my love, you're all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy,
The way you move, you're in control
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

PJ,"What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get
Why don't I take the time and then let go of my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get

Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it
Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it
My heart, you came to visit
Stay extended
The lap of love we lay up in it
Days is vivid same incentive
The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it
A house is not a home unless we staying in it
Stay committed
I used to get around now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties
I can't do this casually actually you challenge me
To balance me
Paid dues and salaries
Been through truths and fallacies
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories
In a house with wine playing Amy's ""Valerie""
Then I realized the past ain't my reality
On love's balcony, you standing out for me
This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly
Now I see

What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get
Why don't I take the time and then let go of my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get

This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it
Vibrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing
So many things that you provide the king
You too fly, never should you hide your wings
The awakening, let's keep breaking things
Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we make it cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the wait is off
Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable
State in you relating to the faith in you
Awaken to what faith can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable
To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable
I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya
Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture
A mixture of love, laughter, scripture
The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya
I'm with ya

PJ,"Before you say it's cheaper to keep her 
We consider and read her 
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her 
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita 
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater 
So put your Porche up, (uh) 
Get your divorce up, (uh) 
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up 
Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here 
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill 
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya 
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners 
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient 
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners 
So keep it player dawg, 
Don't make me say it, naw 
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg 
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all 
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all 

[Chorus] 
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane 
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane 
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane 
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane 
I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh, 
Uh-uh-uh (haa), uh-uh-uh (yea), uh-uh-uh 

I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya 
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya 
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone 
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along 
Because I'm only 25, and still going live 
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside 
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive 
The Doubble are 760, or the 645, I'm 
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain 
Money ain't never been a thang 
You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang) 
Rocks the nicest, never seen nuthin' like this 
I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless 
Baby girl you might just 
Get the shatter shine 
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes 
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine 
But you can't be a hater, mane 
You gotta keep it playa, mane 

[Chorus] 

They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all 
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm 
Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm 
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (wha') 
Not the ice, my beat is worth more 
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store 
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad 
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door 
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us 
I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish 
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me 
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Denzel with the blues, bet they can't rely on Eli
12 get the A when they see I
And they know just what we do, still tryna end true real nigga
Try and cop a feel and send 'em to the cotton field
Everything light bright in my eyesight
There goes the neighborhood is just a way to say white flight
They hate at first sight, 'cause love will never treat 'em but a right life gotta give 'em light
But we live our right

I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

All I see is the opposite plotting
Niggas get kilt like a skirt in Scotland
Who mad, crackers wanna box me in like plaid
But I got 'em spinning out of control, no Taz
Too many devils to deal with
Currently camouflaging the coat of chameleons
Blend, tricked by the Rumpelstiltskin
Saying I make all but tryna to take my ends
Real world one scene when I descend
Got a nigga crossed up like a quarter nick grin
I'm rock shit like ISIS, Isaac I'm Newton Huey when shooting, might as well recruit me

Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here

Bodies on top of bodies they're always movin' in silence
I was ridin' at three in the mornin'
Hopin' they don't find me
My warrants came with a warning
You'll never see me in court bitch
It's hide n seek for every nigga in the street
Errbody want a body errbody wanna beat it
Bigger bullet bustin' than anybody that got the heat
Errbody wanna talk, errbody wanna tweet
Why the pistol in the lining only hide it when the cops out
They were lookin' for a plea or a cop out
Droppin' bullets off inside a nigga Dropbox
Why they always tryna get into the hotspot
Niggas really lose minds, but not I
I done came from a place with a face every city never seen
But a jail cell popular
Just showin' you what I see through my optical
This how a motherfucker sound when his options up

I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

I done alot of wrong in my life, as I reflect on my inner thoughts I can see alot of wrong in my rights
I condone in the light
'Cause the darkness within me tend to start
So I let the spark roam through the night
'Cause I'm blind to the fact
A black man could barely survive an attack that the government's residents
Lash at his back
Stacks prove that the truth is bruisin'
How people gotta act like they like it
But me, I could never wait
I must evolve with my fate
Fakeness dissolving the hate
This as real as it gets
Sinners get healed in the ditch
But life just goes on either way

And I stood there shivering
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over
I said to myself
Is that all there is to a fire?
Is that all there is?

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing

And there were clowns 
And elephants
Dancing bears,
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what

Off the top of
A tall building

Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love

In Chinatown
Hung over
You showed me
Just what I could do

Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
Just what it was worth

And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable
In my life
Have all taken place

When we walked through
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face

I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words

Like a gypsy
You dance in circles

And all over the world

Waiting for something

Was it that you told me
That you'd learnt to unfold me
To read my heart like a map
To throw it away and not bring it back

We lie awake just listening
For something human, something apart
To hear something other than our own hearts

PJ Harvey,"Death was everywhere,
In the air
And in the sounds
Coming off the mounds
Of Bolton's Ridge.
Death's anchorage.
When you rolled a smoke
Or told a joke,
It was in the laughter
And drinking water
It approached the beach
As strings of cutters,
Dropped in the sea and lay around us.

Death was in the ancient fortress,
Shelled by a million bullets
From gunners, waiting in the corpses
With hearts that threatened to pop their boxes,
As we advanced into the sun
Death was all and everyone.
Death was all and everyone.

As we advance in the sun
As we advancing every man
As we advancing in the sun

Death hung in the smoke and clung
To four hundred acres of useless beachfront.
A bank of red earth, dripping down 
Dead is now, and now, and now
Death was everywhere
In the air
And in the sounds
Coming off the mounds
Of Bolton's Ridge.
Death's anchorage.
Death was in the staring sun,
Fixing its eyes on everyone.
It rattled the bones of the Night Horsemen
Still lying out there in the open

As we, advancing in the sun
As we, advancing every man
As we, advancing in the sun

'Cause I'll supply all your needs

I'll stop looking at back then
I let go and I'll let God have His way

Sometimes I can't find my way
And often times I struggle
Struggle from day to day
I have to realize that it's not my battle
It's not my battle to fight

That everything will be alright

Pj Sin Suela,"Menos tiros, mas cascos, mas Correas jugando en los Astros,
Menos niños tirando en la calle y mas niños tirando al canasto,
Mas gasto en atletas, menos en guerra y en escopetas

Hay que meterle hasta que Puerto Rico
Lo grite y lo escuche todo el Planeta

A si que metele sin pero rompe tornillos y un aguacero en un fangero,
Cuando el sol pique mas que un habanero y
El progreso este mas lento que un bolero,

Hasta hay crisis sin dinero esto es sin dormir hasta ser primero
Como enero tu eres un guerrero yo voy a ti con tu pueblo te espero,

Por que nunca somos los mas grandes pero tenemos mas
Hambre mas corazón mas patria mas orgullo en nuestra sangre,

Así que prende las velas abuela saca la biblia
Que cuando nos representes voy a gritar con toda tu familia

A los maestros y a los profesores,
A las madres solteras, a los trabajadores,
Al dueño de la barra que pone los juegos,
Y al barbero que tiene de rubio hasta a los peli negros,
A los panas que compra los shots cuando
Bebe por que en Puerto Rico todo se puede,

Así que aprovecho mi minuto de fama
Parece que nadie hoy comió manzana,
Quizás yo mo soy que cambie las cosas
Pero inspiro al que las cambia mañana,
Si eres artista o deportista tienes un deber fuera del parque y la
Pista de motivar nuestra juventud no solo posar para video y revista,

Y señor gobernador no me importa tu partido color pero
Aprovecha el poder que te dimos y cocina un futuro que sepa mejor,
Hechale educación y quítale las cenizas que ese
Caldo reviva a un boxeador de cualquier paliza,
Y si a ti que me ves por televisión
Abraza a tus papa y dile te quiero de corazón,
Por que el tiempo pasa a las millas mira llego la
Navidad así que sube los tragos por puertorro y nuestra unidad,

PJ Tha Rap Hustla,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

*Talking till the End*",Intro,2007
PJ The Hustler,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Placebo,"Jackie left on a cold, dark night
Telling me he'd be home
Sailed the seas for a hundred years
And left me all alone

Now I've been dead for twenty years
I've been washing the sand with my ghostly tears
Searching the shores for my Jackie-oh

And I remember the day that the young man came
Said, your Jackie's gone, he is lost in the rain
And I ran to the beach
And laid me down

You're all wrong, I said
And they stared to the sand
That man knows the sea like the back of his hand
He'll be back some time
Laughing at you

And I've been waiting all this time
For my man to come, take his hand in mine
And lead me away
To unseen shores

I've been washing the sand with my salty tears
Searching the shore these long years
And I'll walk the sea forever more
'til I find my Jackie-oh

You crying, tragic waste of skin.
I'm well aware of how it aches.

To try and save your swollen face.
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space.

My oh my.
A song to say goodbye.
A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye,
A song to say,
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those blessed with lucky sevens,
And the voice that made me cry.

You were Mother Nature's son.
Someone to whom I could relate.
Your needle and your damage done,
Remains a sordid twist of fate,
Now I'm trying to wake you up,
To pull you from the liquid sky.
Cause if I don't we'll both end up with just your songs that say goodbye.

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

As sharp as any thorn,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas Day in the morn.

As bitter as any gall,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
For to redeem us all.

Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

 With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

Plácido Domingo,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

Plácido Domingo,"Quiero emborrachar mi corazón 
para olvidar un loco amor 
que más que amor es un sufrir

Y aquí vengo para eso, 
a borrar antiguos besos 
en las besos de otras bocas 

Si su amor fue flor de un día
¿Porqué causa siempre es mía 
esa cruel preocupación? 

Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar 
para olvidar mi obstinación 
y más la vuelvo a recordar

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado 
y pensar que otro a su lado 
pronto, pronto le hablará de amor 

¡Hermano! Yo no quiero rebajarme
ni pedirle, ni llorarle, ni decirle 
que no puedo más vivir

Desde mi triste soledad 
veré caer las rosas 
muertas de mi juventud. 

Gime, bandoneón, tu tango gris, 
quizá a ti te hiera igual 
algún amor sentimental

Llora mi alma de fantoche 
sola y triste en esta noche, 
noche negra y sin estrellas

Si las copas traen consuelo 
aquí estoy con mi desvelo 
para ahogarlo de una vez

Quiero emborrachar al corazón 
para después poder brindar 
por los fracasos del amor

Like I've never seen the sky before
I want to vanish inside your kiss

Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste

And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide

Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
But I love you until the end of time

I will love you until my dying day

"Placido Domingo, Jr.","Perhaps love is like a resting place
A shelter from the storm
It exists to give you comfort
It is there to keep you warm
And in those times of trouble
When you are most alone
The memory of love will bring you home

Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer
It wants to show you more
And even if you lose yourself
And don't know what to do
The memory of love will see you through

Oh, love to some is like a cloud
To some as strong as steel
For some a way of living
For some a way to feel
And some say love is holding on
And some say letting go
And some say love is everything
And some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside
Or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever
And all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you",Perhaps Love,2013

Plaid,"They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited till the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Just where he'd been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms again he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms again she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
As sure as the river reach the seas,
back in his arms is where she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the sea,

Does he feel better than me?

Why did you let me feel?
Is that the way it's got to be?
What's wrong with me?

Says ""Boy quit foolin' around""

Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""

But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight

What's it like in New York city?
I'm a thousand miles away
But, girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true

Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me

Hey there, Delilah
I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'd just laugh along because we'd know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah
You be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be makin' history like I do
You know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Plan B,"So he says he loves you, wants you to be his wife
But he's too hooked on the crack pipe for that to be right
It's all lies, none of it's true, though it hurts
You know what you gotta do, cut him loose like a dirty needle

You don't know where he's been
All I know is that I've seen him high when he says that he's clean
There was a gray patch when he first bust on the scene
But as the mystery unraveled, all became black and white
Know what I mean?

We can never be friends, he can go to hell
No more hanging 'round the house like a bad smell
Either he goes or I do, it's your decision, mama, it's all on you

You're too old to be naive and I know you ain't ignorant
That's what's botherin' me, ma 'cause you're goin' on different
And I ain't never seen you loved up like this before
Why's it everybody but you who can see that you deserve more?

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

When I first met him, thought he was cool
Had a few things in common like supporting Arsenal
I saw the way he made you happy like a love fool
Coming down when times were hard up stressful

But all that don't matter to shit
When he starts acting like a little kid
Treating you as if you was some kind of bitch

Mama, you ain't rich but stills he borrows your money
And never pays you back
'Cus any penny he gets, he spends on that bad habit

Fuckin' takes the piss bringin' that slut in to our house
Is the ultimate diss
Now I know you threw him out for that
But how long is it gonna be before you take him back?
Mama, know you're lonely but you're the only

One who can't see that this bloke is a phoney
And he don't really care bout ya, mum
He just says he does 'cus he fuckin' thinks ya dumb

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

My mama loves a crack head?
Is that what I'm supposed to tell my friends?
When they ask me how I'm doing, am I supposed to pretend?
Act like there's nothing's wrong when there blame there is
Turn the other cheek when he's takin' the piss

Fuck that that's not how the man of the house acts
I gotta defend my territory, guard my patch
When I know he's doing doggy shit behind your back
Put my foot down, stand my ground and that

This has got to stop whether the guy buns crack or not
His head ain't there he's fuckin' lost the plot
Dead and buried is the act phrase can't even act right
Can't even act his age that's so fuckin' lame
Thirty something years old, he should feel ashamed

If I was him, I'd slit my my veins at the mains
In a lukewarm bath and sit in it till my arteries drain
Do it right this time so I don't have to do it again
Cause there's nothing more pathetic than a cry for help

Either you do or you don't, wanna kill ya self
Everybody knows you got a problem so it don't matter if you admit it
But what you gotta do is be a man 'n' fuckin' deal with it

I know the truth hurts, mama
But this shit gotta be said
He don't love you, he never has and that's a fact
The only thing he really loves in this world is crack

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight

Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and jury
The same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
Im innocent I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone shes obsessed with
Cos she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down makes her lose it
Cos she cant separate the man from the music
And im saying all this in the stand
As my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons Valerie
So the jury don't look like their buying it
And its making me nervous
Arms crossed screw faced like im trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murder's
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down

She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh (yes you did)

Mary se deja si por el cuello besan
Como le gusta se trago a su media hermana
Su media hermana Juana es loca de la cabeza
Juana baila fuma besa el dembow prende marihuana

Mary su faldita apreta no la suda por el flow
Bailando en cara encima una mesa dembow
Vela como sólita mansita se roba el show
Mientras aquel DJ quita bon de de de de de de

Gatita gatarita comenzó la función
Comenzó con la cinturita en acción
Deja que el ritmo del DJ te suba la presión
Pa baja la tensión date toque hechate un bong

Dale candela pa encima no se quita
Tengo el B12que su cuerpo necesita
Tengo el pure que su boca solicita
Me tiene loco loco pues la pongo loquita

Si arriba la acaricio abajo se toca sólita
Con su servicio que tengo por su vueltica
Adicto de sus besos no se su cinturita
Pa ella soy su cura
Ella es mi curita

Nos vamos a fuego donde el cuerpo lo permita
Le doy pal muro pa lo oscuro y se me excita
Le doy mas duro porque duro pa mi grita
Solo me la corro
O lo merita

Mary se deja si por el cuello besan
Como le gusta se trago a su media hermana
Su media hermana Juana es loca de la cabeza
Juana baila fuma besa el dembow prende marihuana

Mary se deja si por el cuello besan
Como le gusta se trago a su media hermana
Su media hermana Juana es loca de la cabeza
Juana baila fuma besa el dembow prende marihuana

Dale
Que el humo le llegue a la cabeza
Y que lo combine con cerveza
Juana sólita busca su presa
Y le seduce con destreza

Quiero besarle el cuello
Bailarle hacerle el amor
Quiero caerle en su juego de la seducción
Juana se prende en fuego cuando me le pego yo
Cuando la acaricio bailando reggaetón
Quiero llevarla pa casa
Hazle un tri-son
En mi cuarto bien loca
En mi cama freelon
Un poco de whisky un piky
Una cesta de creepy
Dale to la noche pa que se levante happy

Ella es mi mami por que dice soy su papi
Yo quiero un cantito de eso que ella da de gratis
Yo quiero ver su cuerpo bailando una del DJ
Mary me arrebata y ella es toda guille

Y hay una historia y su historia como la pille
Maria es pistola le gusta que la martillen
Quien es otra cosa rosa búscala rastrillen
Bebe fuma hierba y al garete piden

Mary se deja si por el cuello besan
Como le gusta se trago a su media hermana
Su media hermana Juana es loca de la cabeza
Juana baila fuma besa el dembow prende marihuana

Mary se deja si por el cuello besan
Como le gusta se trago a su media hermana
Su media hermana Juana es loca de la cabeza
Juana baila fuma besa el dembow prende marihuana

I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh

She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby

So I said, what you saying girl it cant be right
How can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
So she said boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door
She said but I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby (yes you did)


So now up in the courts
Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury
With the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
Im innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone shes obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
As my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons Valerie
So the jury don't look like their buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed screw faced like im trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murder's
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down

Even though I told them she

She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh (yes you did)

She said I love you more than words can sing
She said I love you bayayayayby

Plan B,"So he says he loves you, wants you to be his wife
But he's too hooked on the crack pipe for that to be right
It's all lies, none of it's true, though it hurts
You know what you gotta do, cut him loose like a dirty needle

You don't know where he's been
All I know is that I've seen him high when he says that he's clean
There was a gray patch when he first bust on the scene
But as the mystery unraveled, all became black and white
Know what I mean?

We can never be friends, he can go to hell
No more hanging 'round the house like a bad smell
Either he goes or I do, it's your decision, mama, it's all on you

You're too old to be naive and I know you ain't ignorant
That's what's botherin' me, ma 'cause you're goin' on different
And I ain't never seen you loved up like this before
Why's it everybody but you who can see that you deserve more?

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

When I first met him, thought he was cool
Had a few things in common like supporting Arsenal
I saw the way he made you happy like a love fool
Coming down when times were hard up stressful

But all that don't matter to shit
When he starts acting like a little kid
Treating you as if you was some kind of bitch

Mama, you ain't rich but stills he borrows your money
And never pays you back
'Cus any penny he gets, he spends on that bad habit

Fuckin' takes the piss bringin' that slut in to our house
Is the ultimate diss
Now I know you threw him out for that
But how long is it gonna be before you take him back?
Mama, know you're lonely but you're the only

One who can't see that this bloke is a phoney
And he don't really care bout ya, mum
He just says he does 'cus he fuckin' thinks ya dumb

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

My mama loves a crack head?
Is that what I'm supposed to tell my friends?
When they ask me how I'm doing, am I supposed to pretend?
Act like there's nothing's wrong when there blame there is
Turn the other cheek when he's takin' the piss

Fuck that that's not how the man of the house acts
I gotta defend my territory, guard my patch
When I know he's doing doggy shit behind your back
Put my foot down, stand my ground and that

This has got to stop whether the guy buns crack or not
His head ain't there he's fuckin' lost the plot
Dead and buried is the act phrase can't even act right
Can't even act his age that's so fuckin' lame
Thirty something years old, he should feel ashamed

If I was him, I'd slit my my veins at the mains
In a lukewarm bath and sit in it till my arteries drain
Do it right this time so I don't have to do it again
Cause there's nothing more pathetic than a cry for help

Either you do or you don't, wanna kill ya self
Everybody knows you got a problem so it don't matter if you admit it
But what you gotta do is be a man 'n' fuckin' deal with it

I know the truth hurts, mama
But this shit gotta be said
He don't love you, he never has and that's a fact
The only thing he really loves in this world is crack

Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that, no

I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that, no
I can't go for that",Mama (Loves A Crackhead),2006
Plan B,"The first day I saw her was at the train station
She was half black, half Caucasian
At first, yo, I thought she was Asian
But as I get a bit closer her origin in blatant
The best of both worlds, caramel complexion
And I swear when she smiled I almost, got an erection
Piercing green eyes, they shine like emeralds
When she, gave me the wink I could only think with my genitals
She tells me her name as soon as I approach her
It's Charmaine, Charmaine De la Rosa
I say, ""is that Spanish"" she says, ""yeah"" I say, ""kosher""
Whole time I'm imagining what it would be like to dose her
Train pulls up and we get on it together
Duration of the journey get to know each other better
We exchange numbers and agree to meet up afterwords
She blows me a kiss and with that I departed

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line
Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line

One week and 20 pound phone credit later
I don't just wanna seduce this girl, now I wanna date her
She got a great personality and sense of humor
Next time we meet it just cant come any sooner
We arrange to go out for a drink at a bar
She's already there when I arrive and she looks the part
Even more stunning than I remember
Fuck it, drop-dead gorgeous
Her ass is tight and her breasts are bloody enormous
Hand in hand we walk over to the doorman
He's got a big shiny head yo he looks like George Foreman
He lets her through and asks me for i.D
I'm like ""what the hell you talking 'bout man, I'm 19!""
I whip my drivers license out and he lets me in
Then I trip over a step, how embarrassing
Charmaine let's to see it all but pretends not to see
I feel like a fool, she just thinks its sweet

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line
Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line

The night goes a lot smoother than planned
Apart from the little hick-up at the start it's all gone grand
Whenever guys try to chat her up, she shows them the hand
Turns down every dance saying I'm her man
We get a cab back to my place where we get it on
I take off my shirt, she strips right down to the thong
I marvel at her body, voluptuous curves
Shes a real woman, no doubt about it, her 
Confidence is sky high
Shes the one who's got me on my back
Shes saying ""baby this is your night""
I'm like ""alright, its worth a go I suppose""
So, we switch roles and she takes full control
She starts slow, grinding me softly
Whilst kissing, yeah, shes doing me properly
Its when I start thinking, man
This girls gotta be from outta this world or something because she's shocking me
Never felt like this before this was more than sex
Sex was something that you had with skets
Something the next day you regret with a
Girl you wish that you had never met
Na ah, no way man, this had to be love
I couldn't believe I was saying it, but that's what it was
Like a leaf in the autumn, I had fallen
After that nothing else seemed important

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line
Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you, is way out of line

So now it's time to hear my predicament, my catch 22
I loved this girl but now I have to cut her loose
So I was talking to one of my boys the very next day
And I, told him all about me and Charmaine
He looks at me in a very strange way
And asks me if De La Rosa is her surname
If shes, mixed race and her eyes are green
I say ""yeah"" he replies, ""blood, that girls fourteen""",Charmaine,2006

'cos you've been acting childish t
When the fuck are you gonna grow up man and stopping having these fights with me
Deep down I know were cool sometimes I wonder would really give a fuck if you were six feet under
I look at you as a friend but when it comes down to it its blatant
Me and you ain't tight like the way you are with Jason
And you don't listen to me like the way you listen to him
That makes me think that you don't respect me that's how the dissin' begins
Every time we meet were at each others throats like a couple of bitches
I hate the way you try and go on, like a fuck that's some thick shit
I know one day you'll sort yourself out cos you ain't stupid
I just hope that, that day ain't that far away cos my life's moving at a fast rate
Picking up pace heading towards the right place I don't wanna leave you behind 
But I could feel my heart change 'cause as everyday goes by 
I start to realize who my friends are
If your one of them, prove it

We couldn't get along today
I'll have to call you back later

Once again my friend you managed to rattle someones cage
But for once it ain't mine yo, this time it's Dave's
Fuck me I thought we were bad but you and him are worst 
Falling out over petite shit like women, weed and birds
Talking about how if you never saw each other again it would be too soon
I cant really talk though cos sometimes I feel that way too
I'm just glad that me and you have sorted out our differences 
Now we can finally be on the level as you like to put it just settled
So hows your life man, lately you seem really down
What's it like living on that council estate in south
I know you got that big fuck of dog to protect you but that ain't your manor 
Man what's wrong with your head dude the way you got one blood, 
You need to be careful, ay don't give me that shit 'bout it being all cool 
Just be careful
Look I gotta go when your in the ends next make sure you check me
Alright bruv cool see you next week

Couldn't get along today
We couldn't get along today
I'll have to call you back later
Couldn't get along today
Ooh yeah
Couldn't get along today

Today I'm fucking distraught, I'm beside myself I cant stop crying man
Neither can no one else cos today I got a call from Greg
And the first thing he said was hey b your not gonna believe this man but Tony's dead
And at first I didn't, then I heard the tone in his voice, 
And I knew he was serious so I didn't have a choice
And suddenly it hit me and I went silent lost for words
As I listened to him describe how you died I felt this surge of overwhelming sadness
The fucking bastards why they have to kill you man its madness
I keep picturing your face its the first time I seen you 
Scared as I imagine you dropping from the balcony 
And you falling through the air 
I don't know whether you fell trying to escape or whether you was pushed off 
But whatever they did it was enough to get you more than shook up,
All I know is they turned up at your flat whilst you were sleepin' 
And seriously intended on giving you a beating
That bitch you lived with must ave had something to do with it 
As well she wanted you out of her yard
Why the fuck else would that dog of yours be locked in another room
I find it far too convenient that slag must ave knew 
That they was coming to do you something bad
I can't take this it's driving me mad I just can't believe your gone I never felt this sad
T I fuckin' love you man

Couldn't get along today
We couldn't get along today
I'll have to call you back later
Couldn't get along today
Ooh yeah
Couldn't get along today

Now that your gone don't think we'll ever be the same 
Your death was a tragedy in every kind of way
I can't comprehend all the time we wasted
On being angry at each other instead if just getting along, 
It's wrong and it reminds me of how you left it last with Dave, 
'cause when you died we didn't see his arse for days 
And those days turned to months 
And now those months have turned to years for me to be exact 
'cause still were holding back the tears
I said we haven't seen Dave for your years but we have 
Except it ain't really him 'cause the David we knew would never take crack or heroine 
Hit him hard just like it did with Jason, 
You and him were like brothers and in his heart lies and empty space 
'cause you'll never be replaced
And we all feel the same
What we have is love and respect when someone mentions your name
So know this just before I hang up the line for the last time
We love you
And your forever on our minds
See you in heaven bruv",Couldn't Get Along,2006

'I'm Dead and buried

I'm dead and buried oh yeah
There ain't no hope left for me in this world no
I'm dead already
Can never live in heaven when I live in hell
I'm living in hell'

Alright listen up can't tell you my name for legal purposes
'cos I'm a convicted felon looking at 15 years inside and
I'm Only 27 court told me they'd knock it down to at least 11
On good behaviour get bail after reduced sentence
But things ain't looking good for me back at the scrubs
Already caught up in world of violence and drugs
Walked into
This shit with my eyes closed looking a mug
Came in as a man now its turning me out as a thug
I've shank twin mates
Already one of them is dead the others close to recovering
And is after my head there's nothing I can do now 'cos
I've Made my bed just gonna have to lie in it and watch where I tread
Yo I made a mistake and I know that now the only
Reason I'm in here is 'cos I thought somehow that what
I was doing was right when I loaded up that shotgun and
Attempted to end that mans life
Yo what the fuck would you do if you was in my position?
Found out your sisters been Beaten into submission
By her own boyfriend on the floor of her own kitchen
And violently raped by him as he tells her To stop bitching
Yeah you'd do the exact same thing as me
Play God with a sawn off and cap him in his knee
You'd Chop his balls of if you had the opportunity
Cut his dick in half and leave him with only an inch to pee
Only to find out That it was all in vain
'cos your dumb bitch of a sisters got back together with him again
They're engaged to get Married
You're going insane contemplating a life in prison where you're
Gonna remain
You're dead and buried'

Oh yeah
I'm dead and buried
As good as already half dead
Dunno if I got any heart left
I'm dead and buried
As good as my time past yeah

Plan B,"Every morning when I wake
Every morning when I wake
This is my life everyday this is my life everyday
Wake up in the morning notice something ain't right
'cause although the sun is shinning there is no light

I open up my curtains wipe the sleep from my eyes to tired to realize I've lost my sight
Blinded by my ignorance I prepare my self for the day, 
Thinking this sinking feeling will go away
As I set off on my track the little voice in my head says turn back, 
But when I want to turn back it's too late
Darkness surrounds me drowning me in sorrow, 
'cause I know today will be no different from tomorrow
Hope is quickly fading soon I'll be too far gone for saving my soul will go and leave my body hollow
And still in the face of adversity I search for an inner strength 
Try and stand firm with both fists clenched
But I can't find my heart it's like the fuckin' thing's deserted me 
It used to be there this makes no sense
So I pray to a god that I'm not even sure if I believe in
To help me in my hour of need and keep me breathing
I pray to this god that created a place called Eden
A paradise to put Adam and eve in
But I don't think he hears me speaking
I'm starting to weaken
Now I'm reaching for what's fake
Poisoning my body to escape
Suddenly I'm overwhelmed with optimism my shoulders no longer feel the weight
Yeah life feels great but its fake.

Every morning when I wake
Every morning when I wake
This is my life everyday this is my life everyday
Wake up in the morning notice something ain't right
'cause although the sun is shinning there is no light

It's fake 'cause I know the smile on my face is only there 'cause I'm too intoxicated to care
That inside my soul I cant find no hope just a gaping whole where it used to be there
An amendable tear
That when I'm sober hurts more than I can bare
It just ain't fair
And soon I'll be back in normality
When the poison wears off and my whole bodies aching from the pain of reality
The pain of reality starts to grab at me
Love is a fallacy and I'm staring straight at death as it tries take another stab at me
I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging
Someone hear me please answer my questions
Why is my life just one big deep depression
Is this gods way of teaching me a lesson
Forgive me father for I have sinned
This is my confession
I do bad things and I don't know why I do them
I try to do good deeds but people see right through them
I can't get close to no one, 'cause they won't let me
How can I feel like a man if they don't respect me
Is that my heart?
I feel starting to sink
As the more I talk I'm starting to think
That maybe I feel this way because of the mistakes I've made 
And it ain't got shit to do with no one else
I can only blame myself
It's me who's bad for my health
And only I can rectify what is wrong in my life if only I tried a little bit harder
It all comes down to a choice what would I rather
Stay how I am and watch the days get darker or forgive myself, get on with my life
And not look back after",Everyday,2006
Plan B,"Yeah. What’s up man? How longs it been?
How longs it been Dad? I don’t know. I’d say about

Sixteen years since you went searching for the holy ghost 
And got lost along the way like money in the post
Holier than most is how you used to act walking round 
With your Bible spitting out quotes like they were facts
Paint it black
Men women children as well
If you don’t worship god then you’re going to hell
Always had to take it one step further you couldn’t just pray nope’s
Had to shove it down peoples throats like gay blokes
Like that Basement Jaxx song where’s your head at
When did you lose your mind same time your hair fell out
And your beard started to grow grey hairs started to show 
Or was it when you started speaking in tongue on road
I was only six years old how could you subject me to that shit verbal syphilis
Complete fuckin' gibberish
I was sick of it but too afraid to say
Only saw you once a fortnight at of all of them you had to choose that day
To Bible bash evangelizing in the street
Looking like a tramp who collected trash
Even though you was ? you could have tried to look normal
Even if you was fucked in your head its awful
I know but I’m glad you done a disappearing act screw you
How could I ever introduce anyone to you
Baby this my dad he’s a religious nut. (Oh, hello, what the fuck!) 

I don’t hate you I don’t love you neither
You mean nothing to me (you're) just another geezer
I won't hit you
Still I won't hug you neither

If we ever meet again cold is how I’m gonna treat ya

When we talk about your antics now there always met with laughter. 
Did he really used to make you pray before you ate a mars bar?
Yes. Every time we put something in our mouths we had to pray to Jesus
Why the fuck you think I never used to eat Malteaser’s
I slag you off now and don’t feel bad about it afterwards
Just like all the other kids abandoned by their fathers
“I hate my dad, Homer Simpson look-a-like fat bastard!”
Yeah, well at least you weren’t stuck with Ned Flanders
Who the fuck was I supposed to go to for answers?
Hey mum what’s this sticky shit in my pyjamas?
You weren’t around to teach me shit
Sold your own kids for some ?
And no one’s seen you since
But I bet you turn up when I’m rich chatting shit
Like it weren’t your fault
Probably blame it on your bitch
'Cause your bitch mind's warped
We could here it in her voice every time she talked 
Me and Lauren were young but we weren’t dumb we knew what was going on
First time I met her when she was just your wife to be
I remember that something just didn’t seem right to me
From what I could see
It was simple and plain
She had you under manners like a dog on a chain
Sometimes I used to wonder where you were and why you left
Was it all because of her or what you thought was best
But times have changed and I’m used to you not being there 
So now I no longer wonder nor do I care
You could be dead for all I know
Even more fucked up in your head for all I know
'Cause all I really know is that you left without saying bye
And ain't ever looked back since. Yes there was a time, 
You could have built a bridge but now the gaps to great
And you might find if you try, it’ll just collapse under the weight
'Cause now its far too late 'cause we all grown up
How can you be part of our lives now when you’ve missed so much (that’s why!)

I don’t hate you I don’t love you neither
You mean nothing to me (you're) just another geezer

You can't run away from your past 'cause your past is hereditary
The blood that courses through my veins is your legacy
And will probably be the only thing ever left to me from you
'Cause just like you
I myself have been gifted with a musical talent
Except I go by the name of Ben Drew not Paul Balance
You lived your life like your namesake hung in the balance
Then you fell off the wagon and now the only thing that’s apparent is
You ain't half the man you used to be
But I am more than you could ever be
'Cause you could never see the world as I see it
Where as you try to be something you ain't, I be it
And real fast your past is coming back to haunt you
It's God's will that such a big mistake like me should taunt you
Daunt you
Like a nervous feeling in your gut
I call it fate, but you can call it whatever the fuck you want
Your just a lost little boy so here’s one less worry for ya
I don’t hate you
I just feel sorry for ya
In fact I pity you
I got so much shit on you
If I saw you on the street, I wouldn’t even spit on you

But I don’t hate you. Hating takes too much effort, 
And you ain't worth the fuckin' time of day.

Real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get there throats slit 'coz they talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys
They best go, hide 'coz I'm lookin' for 'em on the sly

'Coz I've had it up to here, right up to here
Might ave to do it reservoir dogs style slice of their ear
'Coz I've had enuff of bredders actin' tough, tryin' ta get rough
When its obvious they ain't rough enuff, listen

I don't just talk the talk, I walk it
That's why my mouth's always comin' out with raw shit
My rap style's distorted like lil' mo getting rapped
And keepin' the baby instead of gettin' it aborted

Yo, I talk morbid just to make you feel awkward
Deaths a part of life, yo, you just can't ignore it
Especially when I rip out your heart and on my sleeve sport it like
Somethin' you feel precious 'coz ya dead gran bought it

I talk so foul, I talk so course, I show no regret
I show no remorse like a necromanic raping a corpse
Up the anal passage while contracting genital warts

My metaphor's are twisted like that game
Where you gotta put that hob nob in ya gob
If you the last one to come on the biscuit
I'm so sadistic so I fantasize about finding
My mums ex floating in a bath tub with his wrists slit

And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get there throats slit 'coz they talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys
They best go, hide 'coz I'm lookin' for 'em on the sly

'Coz I've had enuff of bredders actin' tough, tryin' ta get rough
When its obvious they ain't rough enuff

You best buy a TV if you want me to stop
'Coz I'm so heavy influenced by the things that I watch
It ain't just 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'
It's irreversible, there's my 'City Of God'

It's the news on every channel when I turn on the box
It seems Pedophiles singing on top of the pops
Garry glitter, Michael Mish-a-walk
On the net ken bigley got his neck tek off

That's some nasty shit and still you wonder why I'm sick
When I see this shit and I say exactly what I think
That's some nasty shit and you don't ban it
But you ban computer games, somethin' 'round here really stinks

What about cigarettes and alcoholic drinks?
Or the animal that died just so your wife could wear that mink
Your disgraceful like gettin' caught, pissin' in the sink
A white girl won't suck my dick just because its pink

And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get there throats slit 'coz they talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys
They best go, hide 'coz I'm lookin' for 'em on the sly

Check it, the last verse is just as bad as the first
Compared to the second, yo, it's definitely worse
'Coz this is about a guy getting chauffeured in a hurst
Let me do what Nas did and tell that shit in reverse

The hirst brings the corpse back to the morgue
The guy from the morgue undresses the corpse
Embalming fluid goes back out, the blood goes back in
Body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again

The paramedics walk backwards like an Irish dance
Put the wounded man back in the ambulance
The ambulances engine turns back on
And its lights flash as it plays his favorite song

The guy goes back to the exact spot where they found him
And the medics and and all the passers by go back
Where they came from till eventually
No one surrounds him and the blood pours up him
Rather than down him

The man then falls upwards back on his feet
Stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street
He walks into the blade that cut his belly
Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already

He removes his hand so you can see the cut
And as the knife undoes the slice, it closes back up
He unsays the words he said which were, 'What the fuck'
And unscreams the scream from the first initial cut

Then the blood from he severely severed ear
Crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears
As the knife wielding silhouette unhacks it from the rear
Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear

Then walks backwards thought the bushes
Where he's disregarded nature
Who's the guy on the bench, I'm reading his paper
Takes the snail he stepped on back from its creator
Only to be killed again when I fast forward this shit later

Back in his house now back in his bed
He un-listens to a CD and un-bops his head
Take's the CD out the player and puts it back in its case
Which has my name on the cover along with my face

Fast forward, there's been a murder
And the police know who's done it
Not lookin' for a motive 'coz they don't know why he done it
Sure enough it don't take that long for them to find a reason
And they publicly state it on TV that evening

A couple of months later, this shit gets banned
Like it was me who put that switch in his hand
And told him to kill that man

Like this whole song was just some kinda sickly devised plan
To hurt some poor cunt I don't even know
And I've never met before in my life

The words whoever said, ""The pen is mightier than the sword""
Was right and you better think twice
Before you step to me and pick a fight
",Sick 2 Def,2006
Plan B,"Let me tell you a story.
It's called tough love.

Once upon a time there was a girl called Sonita.
Dreaded goin' home after school 'cause her dad would mistreat her.
Her mum was just as bad, when she got mad, 
was more than glad to lend a hand in helping him beat her.

Sonita, used to wear the cloth of her religion.
Sonita, used to pray to God, thought he was listening.
But nothin' ever changed, at least she couldn't see a difference.
So the relationship between them both became distant.
She didn't agree with the fundamental religious views of her parents. 
Might as well have been speaking gibberish. 
To her, it was incoherent. 
She was livin' in the Western world, 
Couldn't understand why she couldn't be like all the other Western girls.

So one day she rebels. 
Walks into a shop and purchases a copy of Bliss.
A magazine for female teenagers.
Ripped off the plastic rapper, started flickin' through the pages.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

So engrossed in her new found interest, Sonita fails to realize the time.
Before she knows it, it's a quarter to nine.
Should've been back from prayer an hour ago.
Now her parents are gonna know that she's skived.
In the slim hope that they won't,
She hides the copy of Bliss inside the books under her arm and makes her way back home.

She opens the door to find her mum and dad waiting.
The expressions on both of their faces is scathing.
Before she has time to think of an excuse,
Her father's hands are right round her neck like a noose.
So tight he chokes her.
She drops all her books on the floor except the Bliss mag which lands on the sofa.
Dad can't control his rage when he sees that the centre page is a boy band poster.
""She's possessed by the devil!""
Her mother shouts.
Blaming it on Satan, like it's the only explanation.
Grabs Sonita by the hair, down to the basement.
Hearts racing like she knows her life's about to be taken.
They look her in the eyes, say,
""Here's what we're gonna do. 
You've been possessed by a demon,
We're gonna beat him out of you.""

Sonita cries for help.
She sees her mum pick up a broomstick and her dad take off his belt.
It's no use, her brothers and sisters won't listen.
Undeterred, her parents carry out the exorcism.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

For hours they violently torture their daughter.
Beat her until an inch of her life until it's right on the border.
They continue to physically haunt her but now Sonita has a mental disorder.
She no longer cares if she lives or dies.
Absolutely no more tears left to cry.
She's evilness in her parents eyes.
And thinks they're the ones who need to be exorcised.

That's when the rebellious streak completely intoxicates her.
Sudden rush of energy boosts a never before seen aggressive nature.
She decides that no matter what they are never gonna break her.
""Go to hell!"" she screams at her dad as he goes to give her another lick with the belt.
""Go fuck yourself!"" she screams at her mum, knowing that it's only gonna spur her on.
'Cause now Sonita's lost the plot.
The physical pain ain't nothing compared to the heartache when the heart breaks and it rots.
Once filled with so much love.
But now it's so clogged up with hate that it stops beating and she stops breathing.
Her body's just a carcass now, her soul's leaving.
No more pain.
No more bleeding.
Die slow, blow by blow from a severe beating.
It only takes half a dozen more blows to the head before they finally realize that she's dead.

That's when the door busts open and in come the FEDS.
The neighbours must've called them 
When they heard the screams of torment coming from the basement where Sonita's body lay.
Blatant like road kill out on the pavement.
It's quite clear to the police 
That she's been the victim of a horrific case of physical mutilation.

Tough love, tough love. 
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
Tough love, tough love.
I call it hatred.
You call it tough love, I call it hatred.
That's your flesh, your blood, that's sacred.

After being apprehended,
Sonita's parents were asked why their daughters life was so brutally taken.
They said it was out of love.
But only hate breaks something so hard it can never be mended.
To this day they show no remorse.
Their idea of parental guidance will always be to use force.
And what makes this tale even more gory is that this song is based on a true story.
Tough love

I'm from a place were the streets are filled with snakes

I'm walking down the street, past the coppers on the beat

'Cause this is everyday life.
Fuck the police
It's a ghetto state of mind,
'Cept where I'm living I can't see no ghetto, 
This ain't America, it's England, where we live ain't nothing special.
You can take anywhere and call it a ghetto,
Same way you make cyanide, same way you make amaretto.

50 Cent's on MTV, now it's cool to carry metal
Objects,
Now the object is to kill.

How's it make you feel,
Blud, holding that buckey?
Knowledge is power, guns just make you feel lucky.
It's fuckry the way these yout' man like to go on,
Busting shots in the crowd when there's a show on, they're just putting a show on.
Real gangsters stay underground like non-fiction,
They don't fire blanks at Yanks like when Nas played at Brixton.
Thrill seeking dickheads just doing it for kicks and
Hear a next man speak their name from his lips and
Give a guy props for licking shots from a gun 
Like if they fired one at him the fucking prick wouldn't run. 
It's like they're praising these youths for acting so dumb and it's no excuse,
Most of us are fatherless sons.

How come I hear you hatin' but I never see you burst

Shine so fuckin' brightly they think it's day when it's night man

Well, I don't believe the hype, well that's all it is an nuttin' else
But I don't need the hype the words are right to sell themselves
'Coz the words are written from the heart that's why they're felt

Than goin' on a killin' spree and livin' life on the run
Even if sometimes I do feel like gettin' a gun
And runnin' up on everyone who hated me from day one

But what's the point in that? It's ironic where the point be at
Haters from the heart, still the head is where I point the gat
Imagine how your face looks as I cock it back
Pull the trigger, imagine how your face looks after that

Even though I hear it teens say it too much, it makes me sick
Come across so many fools don't make me wanna switch
I won't ruin my career just because you said some shit

I'll dead you quick, on the mics if you keep on beefin'

For Quent, there bent, sweat dripping off the ceiling
Sadomasochists ?
Anything goes when you've got the riches
But only the sexually depraved pay for pregnant bitches
Her name's Katya, he was to do what he wished with
If ya into chicks that wake up with morning sickness
And have to make their way past people fucking
Punters hooked on hookers hooked on smack, cluckin'
Spent a day getting touched up and butt-fucking
Wishing she'd wake up from the nightmare she was stuck in
But she weren't waking up from nothing, this was her reality
Place where dreams come true for those who lack morality
She had to get out, if not for her child, for her sanity
'Cause the only difference between this place and hell was gravity

You want the business, runaway, runaway, where the money man?
You want the business, you want the business, the business, the money man?
You want the business, you want the business, the business, the money man?

It was a weird twist of fate, the way that she escaped
She knew her chance would come, she just had to wait
'Till one of her abductors made a mistake
Mixing vodka with heart pills and smoking a straight
With the door unlocked, ain't the smartest idea
When your runnings are illegal and your cargo live in fear
The path was now clear, but only for a exit
'Cause the road ahead was long, and full of unexpected
Twists and turns, she learned inadvertently
How to cope with life's little moments of uncertainty
Feeling safe on the street, however absurd it seems
The mother and baby unit, where she had disturbing dreams
Was a place she didn't feel was safe and had to leave
Would only be a matter of time before she had police, asking her questions
Finding out the truth about her underworld connections
Sending her back to the brothel, either that, or simply just deportin' her
She's met corrupted law before, she can't see them supportin' her
So if she goes along the road, it slowly starts destroyin' her
Not knowing where she's going, or why grudgers ? keep ignorin' her

You want the business, runaway, runaway, where the money man?
You want the business, you want the business, the business, the money man? 
You want the business, you want the business, the business, the money man?

Life was hard in the brothel, now it's hard in the street,
'Cause English is a language she can hardly speak,
Like so many Eastern European people you meet,
Only difference is they legal and they earning their keep,
She was smuggled into Britain almost two months gone,
She didn't know she was pregnant 'till they saw the bump,
And now the baby's here and they're both on the run,
If she don't beg, steal and borrow she ain't no kind of mum,
Her feelings a vicious circle, with a big set of teeth,
The sharper they are, the smarter the thief,
So now she's broke again and she don't even know it,
Until she reaches for the purse and it hurts 'cause she stole it,
To find it ain't there, I guess you reap what you sow,
Its a bitch how karma works, it's hard to work out where she's going,
Resortin' back to prostitution when the traffic is flowin',
Her ride stops and drives off when it sees what she's towing,
Must be hard knowing that you're nothing but a peasant,
Game for the hunt, its the prairie like pheasant,
Loitering at bus-stops like bored adolescents,
With sex on their mind, 'cause you give off the impression,
That you'd sell yourself for money, not find the thought repellent
Getting fucked in the field from behind, 
For you best feed your child just so it don't cry, its unpleasant
But that's what she did and now we're back in the present

Pay the price for her mistakes
I guess she only has herself to blame
And to her that's the deepest shame

She was once a princess
But now she's a mess
A fiend for a fix like the rest
Eliciting sex and pocket less
But she was a sweet fiend never the less
Back in the day abused as a child
She was always likely to end up this way
The past lived in the dark parts of the brain
And only heroin seemed take away the pain
So she folded at the voyeur and lit the flame
Inhale exhale out once again she's on the game
The unit on her face and going rate
Just not the name of only herself to blame
She lives the hell
But there's a millions other girls just like her
Shell out in the streets with nothing else to sell
To these desperate Mel's have it in themselves so

Plan B,"Mr drug dealer
Mr drug dealer
Mr drug dealer

The night is ‘75 there was this chick named Janet 
A pregnant heroin addict who said she didn't plan it
So never thought to stop, or ever kick the habit
'Cause Kirby let her do it and she knew he always had it
Down in his cellar with Trevor another addict
Who was at it like an asthmatic trapped in an attic
Sucking on an asthma punt 
Though you never know by looking at him that's the cunt
Who by 1983 was in the national front
Yeah he had a shaved head but still got mashed on drugs
So Kirby didn't mind him hanging round that much
Especially anytime Janet came round to fuck
Get her fix while her kid Chris waited around
A nine year old boy he was healthy and loud
'Cause even when she was pregnant she was smoking around
And she was ducking that he wasn't born disabled somehow

Still when you're too loud you get a clap round your head
Kirby ain't his dad but he does what he says
Stays downstairs in the cellar with Trev
While Kirby's upstairs giving Janet her meds
At least that's what they tell Chris still he ain't that dumb
He knows Kirby's upstairs banging his mum
While he's left in the basement with some racist cunt
Who's been waiting round for ever for his mother fuckin' day to come

Mr drug dealer

What an environment to raise a kid
Round crack dealers, heisters and racist pricks
Trevor, looted the place as well as maiming Chris
Left a permanent scar on his face the same as his
With a, razor blade yeah takes the piss
Whether you prejudice or not man he's just a kid
But that's what Trevor done no one ever saw him after that
6 years past now Kirby's hookin' up the crack
It's the new drug everybody's going crazy for
1989 the year Chris started selling draw
Picking up from Kirby, scar there beneath his eye
Think after everything that's happened he would treat him right
But par him off with just another ounce of weed
'Cause a quarter of the bag is a bunch of fuckin' seeds
Hundreds of them and twigs the size of fuckin' trees 
But if he ever moaned he get a slap across his cheek

1990 is the year that really took it's toll 
'Cause that's the year his mother Janet took an overdose 
Of heroin and died, god rest her tortured soul
Now he's left to fend for himself or by his own

Mr drug dealer

it's 1995, now that he's older stress weighs on his shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but he hides it from his olders
He's been living on the far side since he was a youth
But the way he lives now is a far cry
From the way he, did in the past 'cause he's
Made his way up from sellin' ounces to bars of weed
Out In the streets, where people do their nasty deeds 
He sees ‘em making money so he wants a larger piece
He's a man now, 21 years of age
It's been a couple years since Kirby's palms were raised
Lost in anger, ended up across his face 'cause he's a man now
And Kirby knows he's past his stage of gettin' beats
Still that don't change the way he treats
Chris when he comes round to his, to get his weed
Kirby don't like his attitude he's cocky now believe
So again he palms him off with more twigs and fuckin' seeds

But Chris ain't havin' none of it he ain't no little kid now
He squares up to Kirby who really don't look that big now
And really can't do shit now but pay Chris what he owes
And weed but also pride 'cause that what Chris takes when he goes
Kirby knows he's getting old, and that's what really hurts
He ain't cut out for this work the way he once was upon a time
But he don't know no other way to make a living on the grind	
Selling drugs is all he's been, his only way of getting by

Then the cops come round undercover fed come shut him down, lock him down
15 years away from now, the youth will grow, a big and strong and take control
Have it ah, that's the way it goes

To be the only thing in this life that wasn’t a dream
Made from stone still and iron beams
The council blocks to defining mean
And bullied the sky so that everybody can see
Some birds are caged and will never be free
And gradually people began to change there beliefs
Until god was nothing more than just a fictional being
The worship and money merged all colours and creed
Into one true religion that was driven by greed

He knew as soon as he saw her that he adored her

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Tu me capturaste
Me desconectaste
Ya no soy yo tu me cambiaste
No ha habido una que me quitara mi arte
De ser un tipo normal y te la jugaste
Y me gusta como tu me tratas

Cuando me miras, me besas y me hablas
De la forma como toca usted lo gana
Y en el party luces tu como mi gata

Y me gusta como tu me bailas
Todos te miran pero tu duermes en mi casa
Yo soy el que le da uba uba guaca
Y cuando tienes frio yo la arropo en la cama

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Ya yo no se en mi lo que pasa
Ahora siempre estoy en mi casa
Porque siento que ella me ama
Ya no duermo solo en mi cama

Yo quisiera que
Tu la vieras como ella dispone para mi
Nunca dice no siempre me dice a mi que si
Me cocina, enciende velas siempre junto a mi
Haciendo el amor hasta morir

Yo soy difícil de envolver
Pero ahora no se que voy a hacer porque esa mujer
Me hizo cambiar de parecer y capturo mi ser
Y no te quiero perder
Me tienes adicto a todo tu cuerpo girl

Que me paso
Que me sucedió
Que me envolvió
Pensando que era una aventura

De hacer el amor con ella
Y en ocasiones me confundo
Y no sé ni que pensar
Pasan los días y yo sigo sin saber de ella
Vivo el momento sé que algún día va a terminar
Va a terminar

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe
Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

Hey!
El amor es raro
Demasiado caro
Como el dinero de mano en mano
Si no me crees chequea tu pasado
Cuántas veces te has enamorado
Pero el verdadero no llega
Y el tiempo no para de correr
Y tu sigues dando candela
Y a mi me tratas de envolver
Los dos queremos sexo, placer
Tener contacto de piel
Así es que nos gusta
Porque el amor asusta

Tu amor es viento
Viento que pasa
Hoy te tengo, no sé mañana
Miedo al fracaso
Vives un juego
Yo te comprendo

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

No es casualidad
La química que tenemos tu y yo en la intimidad
Como una amistad
El poco tiempo que tu y yo pasamos en realidad
Pero todo es suspenso
(Suspenso!)
Cada día más intenso
(Intenso!)
Pero como te convenzo
Te dejas llevar por eso
Tú y tu cualidad
Hace que me sienta que me quieres de verdad
Mientras tanto
Me vivo el momento por si algún día te vas

Tu amor es viento
Viento que pasa
Hoy te tengo, no sé mañana
Miedo al fracaso
Vives un juego
Yo te comprendo

Porque el amor no existe,
No existe
Porque el amor no existe,
No existe

En el olvido quedan las promesas y las palabras
(Las Palabras!)
Es sencillo
(Easy!)
La ilusión viene y va porque el amor se acaba y la
Atracción termina
(Termina!)
Porque en la vida nada es para siempre
(Nada!)

Porque siempre se sufre por amor
Pero siempre buscamos enamorarnos

Bailando en cara encima una mesa dembow
Vela como sólita mansita se roba el show
Mientras aquel DJ quita bon de de de de de de

Gatita gatarita comenzó la función
Comenzó con la cinturita en acción
Deja que el ritmo del DJ te suba la presión
Pa baja la tensión date toque hechate un bong

Dale candela pa encima no se quita
Tengo el B12que su cuerpo necesita
Tengo el pure que su boca solicita
Me tiene loco loco pues la pongo loquita

Si arriba la acaricio abajo se toca sólita
Con su servicio que tengo por su vueltica
Adicto de sus besos no se su cinturita
Pa ella soy su cura
Ella es mi curita

Nos vamos a fuego donde el cuerpo lo permita
Le doy pal muro pa lo oscuro y se me excita
Le doy mas duro porque duro pa mi grita
Solo me la corro
O lo merita

Que el humo le llegue a la cabeza
Y que lo combine con cerveza
Juana sólita busca su presa
Y le seduce con destreza

Quiero besarle el cuello
Bailarle hacerle el amor
Quiero caerle en su juego de la seducción
Juana se prende en fuego cuando me le pego yo
Cuando la acaricio bailando reggaetón
Quiero llevarla pa casa
Hazle un tri-son
En mi cuarto bien loca
En mi cama freelon
Un poco de whisky un piky
Una cesta de creepy
Dale to la noche pa que se levante happy

Ella es mi mami por que dice soy su papi
Yo quiero un cantito de eso que ella da de gratis
Yo quiero ver su cuerpo bailando una del DJ
Mary me arrebata y ella es toda guille

Y hay una historia y su historia como la pille
Maria es pistola le gusta que la martillen
Quien es otra cosa rosa búscala rastrillen
Bebe fuma hierba y al garete piden

Que cuando tú no estás se pasan tirando puyas 
Yo te lo decía pero caso no me hiciste
Te envolviste, Por eso perdiste
Mami yo te daba todo tú lo sabías
Te complacía en cada cosa que pedías
Pero por no valorar lo que por ti hacía 
Ahora es otra que pide su vida llena de alegría

Ya no hay paseos para el mall “Nope”
Ni para el bote a coger sol “Tampoco”
Ahora es otra que le brindo mi calor
Nos embriagamos de pasión y ambos nos ponemos locos 

Se se dijera que te trato mal son otros veinte
Por eso es que tú abusas porque he sido diferente 
Eres inteligente, tratas de enamorarme
Pero esas actitudes lo que han hecho es alejarme

Tirarme a un lugar donde la luz enfoca 
Donde el alcohol es bueno de los besos en la boca 
Donde mi piel se arropa 
De nenas que me quieren 
Para hacer en la cama cositas que tu no quieres

Sé que te dolerá que otra se gaste la torta

I'm at the bar and I see a chick checking me out,
Form afar yeah she wants my dick there aint a doubt,
She's got a skirt so short,
It makes you drool from the mouth,
Looking my way as if to say i'm in with a shout,
So I pull a chair over there and buy her a drink,
She says 'Cheers' I say 'yeah' , our glasses go clink

Yo sé bien, que tú tampoco has podido borrar 
Ese momento que nos pudimos acercar 
Ese segundo que vi tus ojos cerrar 
Es que yo sé bien 
Desde el principio que te sentí suspirar 
Tus manos temblaban, tus labios igual 
Como una atracción fatal 

Y yo me acuerdo que del comienzo y del final 
Que la sensación, que los sentidos paralizar 
Y poco me entragaste tu boca endulzando en mi paladar 
Y sin pensar me puse a actuar, rapido pude notar 
El deseo entre tus piernas, que no pude acariciar 
No me dejaste expresar, nunca paraste de besar 
Una manera que te da la temperatura normal 
Aquí tu saca lo de única lo difícil pa' buscar 

He besado a mil mujeres y no hay, hay 
He tenido mil placeres y no hay, hay 

He recorrido todo el mundo 
Buscando un beso profundo 
De esos besos intensos 
Pero no hay, hay 

Ha pasado mucho tiempo 
Desde aquel magnifico beso 
Pero recuerdo cada segundo, milésima de segundos
Que me hacen recordarte a ti (uh oh) 

Desde aquel beso que nos dimos 
No dejo de pensar en ti, ti
(Oh, No, No) 
Dime ¿dónde los consigo? 
He encontrado besos pero no son así 
No saben a ti

Pero dime dime dónde encontrar esos besos 
Que yo los busco por ahí y no los encuentro 
¿Qué vamos a hacer, mujer, mujer?
Sigo buscando unos labios como los tuyos 
Tengo mil gatas y ninguna tiene tus besos 
¿Qué vamos a hacer, mujer, mujer?

Desde aquel beso que nos dimos 
No dejo de pensar en ti, ti

Dime ¿dónde los consigo? 
He encontrado besos pero no son asi

Quieres que sea bueno si me conociste malo

El tiempo nunca es suficiente 
Me gusta estar a tu lado 
Hablarte y decirte todo lo que siento 

Me miras y entiendo lo que dices 
Me tocas y haces que mi piel erice 
Me habla y tus palabras en mi viven 
Me pruebo y tu cuerpo se derrite 
Te miro y tu alma se desviste 
Te toco y curo tus cicatrices 
Te hablo y hago que te hipnotices 
Te pruebo y haces que me lo disfrute 

No quiero que te vayas 
Quédate aquí conmigo 
Cuando te tengo nada falta 
Que bien la paso contigo

No quiero que te vayas 
Quédate aquí conmigo 
Cuando te tengo nada falta 
Que bien la paso contigo

Si la gente supiera que hasta con mirarme tú me tocas 
Nadie sabe, imaginan los sabores de tu boca 
Cada abrazo, cada beso que mi mente alborota 
La fragancia que despide tu presencia en mi ropa 
Desenfoca mi orgullo por el piso desemboca 
Cuando a solas olvidamos en la cama se encojota 
Las ganas cuando nos vemos hasta la luna, eso se nota 
La distancia entre nosotros y el deseo nos acopla 

Llegas y te vas otra noche 
Fugaz donde solo quedo tu perfume 
He vuelto a probar el sabor de quedarme 
Con ganas como de costumbre 
Ayer te bese hasta las sombras 
Cuando estás conmigo allí es que tu descubres 
Donde no han podido llegar 
Yo si te hago volar yo jamás te detuve 

No quiero que te vayas 
Quédate aquí conmigo 
Cuando te tengo nada falta 
Que bien la paso contigo 

Esa es mi nena 
Mi mejor amiga cuando yo tengo problemas 
Siempre me acompaña 
Esa es mi alma gemela

Dos animales devorándose en el matre 

Pasión y sentimientos 
No quiero que se acabe el momento 
El cuarto frío 
Y nuestros cuerpos están hirviendo 
Siempre perdemos los dos la noción del tiempo 
La pasamos bien, tú y yo no'la estamos viviendo

Plan B,"Hoy me levanté pensando en ti
Como sacábamos tiempo para nuestros encuentros, cerca de aquí
Esos momentos intensos del deseo dos presos, cuando era así
Dicen que han cambiado los tiempos
Que ahora tienes dueño
Y no me corresponde a mí
Solo te mientes a tí
Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Desperté con ganas de llamarte
Deseos de verte
De pasar a buscarte
Y no se puede aparente
Quiero la cabeza dañarte
Arrastrarte pa meterte
Beber toda la noche
Y en high arrebatarte

Te voy a enseñar que de tu cuerpo
Soy el dueño de sus partes
Con quien duermes de noche, no sabe ni tocarte
Contesta mi llamar, antes de que se haga tarde
Vuelvas a sus brazos, donde yo ya no pueda darte

Como aquella noche de pasión
Donde éramos fuego, quemándonos intensos
En tu habitación
Donde aún guardas recuerdos y el olor de mi cuerpo
Cerca de ti
Yo solo invento un pretexto y envíame un texto
Y yo te correspondo a ti
Cuando te sientas así

Y tu como que tienes ganas

Ganas, de olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Yo se que tienes a alguien
Que tu dices que lo quieres
Pero no le hacemos daño
Así evitamos que se entere

No dejes que la conciencia te frene
Que tu quieres que te haga lo que te hace siempre tu nene
Loco por sentir como ahora te mueves
Imaginarte me pone caliente
Y más cuando yo se como tu eres
Cuando comienzas nada te detiene

Maldy!
Hey tu sabes que esto no es amor
Las ganas son sentir tu color y tu calor
A ley nena pa que te tire la mision
Tengo un secreto que tu eres mi perdición
Eres sensual a lo bruto si es tu decision
Ah, de espalda para que baje el sudor
Es que yo quiero castigo pa tu cuerpo
Y lo telefones off
Sexo entre dos
No hay rastreo ni motivos pa discusión

Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Plan B,"Hoy me levanté pensando en ti
Como sacábamos tiempo para nuestros encuentros, cerca de aquí
Esos momentos intensos del deseo dos presos, cuando era así
Dicen que han cambiado los tiempos
Que ahora tienes dueño
Y no me corresponde a mí
Solo te mientes a tí
Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Desperté con ganas de llamarte
Deseos de verte
De pasar a buscarte
Y no se puede aparente
Quiero la cabeza dañarte
Arrastrarte pa meterte
Beber toda la noche
Y en high arrebatarte

Te voy a enseñar que de tu cuerpo
Soy el dueño de sus partes
Con quien duermes de noche, no sabe ni tocarte
Contesta mi llamar, antes de que se haga tarde
Vuelvas a sus brazos, donde yo ya no pueda darte

Como aquella noche de pasión
Donde éramos fuego, quemándonos intensos
En tu habitación
Donde aún guardas recuerdos y el olor de mi cuerpo
Cerca de ti
Yo solo invento un pretexto y envíame un texto
Y yo te correspondo a ti
Cuando te sientas así

Y tu como que tienes ganas

Ganas, de olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Yo se que tienes a alguien
Que tu dices que lo quieres
Pero no le hacemos daño
Así evitamos que se entere

No dejes que la conciencia te frene
Que tu quieres que te haga lo que te hace siempre tu nene
Loco por sentir como ahora te mueves
Imaginarte me pone caliente
Y más cuando yo se como tu eres
Cuando comienzas nada te detiene

Maldy!
Hey tu sabes que esto no es amor
Las ganas son sentir tu color y tu calor
A ley nena pa que te tire la mision
Tengo un secreto que tu eres mi perdición
Eres sensual a lo bruto si es tu decision
Ah, de espalda para que baje el sudor
Es que yo quiero castigo pa tu cuerpo
Y lo telefones off
Sexo entre dos
No hay rastreo ni motivos pa discusión

Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Plan B.,"She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh

She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby

So I said, what you saying girl it cant be right
How can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
So she said boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door
She said but I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby (yes you did)


So now up in the courts
Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury
With the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
Im innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone shes obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
As my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons Valerie
So the jury don't look like their buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed screw faced like im trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murder's
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down

Even though I told them she

She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh (yes you did)

She said I love you more than words can sing
She said I love you bayayayayby

You wouldn't do this if you did

plan b:,"See-see-check, yo

Real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get there throats slit 'coz they talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys
They best go, hide 'coz I'm lookin' for 'em on the sly

'Coz I've had it up to here, right up to here
Might ave to do it reservoir dogs style slice of their ear
'Coz I've had enuff of bredders actin' tough, tryin' ta get rough
When its obvious they ain't rough enuff, listen

I don't just talk the talk, I walk it
That's why my mouth's always comin' out with raw shit
My rap style's distorted like lil' mo getting rapped
And keepin' the baby instead of gettin' it aborted

Yo, I talk morbid just to make you feel awkward
Deaths a part of life, yo, you just can't ignore it
Especially when I rip out your heart and on my sleeve sport it like
Somethin' you feel precious 'coz ya dead gran bought it

I talk so foul, I talk so course, I show no regret
I show no remorse like a necromanic raping a corpse
Up the anal passage while contracting genital warts

My metaphor's are twisted like that game
Where you gotta put that hob nob in ya gob
If you the last one to come on the biscuit
I'm so sadistic so I fantasize about finding
My mums ex floating in a bath tub with his wrists slit

And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get there throats slit 'coz they talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys
They best go, hide 'coz I'm lookin' for 'em on the sly

I've had it up to here, right up to here
Might ave to do it reservoir dogs style slice of their ear
'Coz I've had enuff of bredders actin' tough, tryin' ta get rough
When its obvious they ain't rough enuff

You best buy a TV if you want me to stop
'Coz I'm so heavy influenced by the things that I watch
It ain't just 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'
It's irreversible, there's my 'City Of God'

It's the news on every channel when I turn on the box
It seems Pedophiles singing on top of the pops
Garry glitter, Michael Mish-a-walk
On the net ken bigley got his neck tek off

That's some nasty shit and still you wonder why I'm sick
When I see this shit and I say exactly what I think
That's some nasty shit and you don't ban it
But you ban computer games, somethin' 'round here really stinks

What about cigarettes and alcoholic drinks?
Or the animal that died just so your wife could wear that mink
Your disgraceful like gettin' caught, pissin' in the sink
A white girl won't suck my dick just because its pink

And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get there throats slit 'coz they talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys
They best go, hide 'coz I'm lookin' for 'em on the sly

Had it up to here, right up to here
Might ave to do it reservoir dogs style slice of their ear
'Coz I've had enuff of bredders actin' tough, tryin' ta get rough
When its obvious they ain't rough enuff

Check it, the last verse is just as bad as the first
Compared to the second, yo, it's definitely worse
'Coz this is about a guy getting chauffeured in a hurst
Let me do what Nas did and tell that shit in reverse

The hirst brings the corpse back to the morgue
The guy from the morgue undresses the corpse
Embalming fluid goes back out, the blood goes back in
Body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again

The paramedics walk backwards like an Irish dance
Put the wounded man back in the ambulance
The ambulances engine turns back on
And its lights flash as it plays his favorite song

The guy goes back to the exact spot where they found him
And the medics and and all the passers by go back
Where they came from till eventually
No one surrounds him and the blood pours up him
Rather than down him

The man then falls upwards back on his feet
Stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street
He walks into the blade that cut his belly
Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already

He removes his hand so you can see the cut
And as the knife undoes the slice, it closes back up
He unsays the words he said which were, 'What the fuck'
And unscreams the scream from the first initial cut

Then the blood from he severely severed ear
Crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears
As the knife wielding silhouette unhacks it from the rear
Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear

Then walks backwards thought the bushes
Where he's disregarded nature
Who's the guy on the bench, I'm reading his paper
Takes the snail he stepped on back from its creator
Only to be killed again when I fast forward this shit later

Back in his house now back in his bed
He un-listens to a CD and un-bops his head
Take's the CD out the player and puts it back in its case
Which has my name on the cover along with my face

Fast forward, there's been a murder
And the police know who's done it
Not lookin' for a motive 'coz they don't know why he done it
Sure enough it don't take that long for them to find a reason
And they publicly state it on TV that evening

A couple of months later, this shit gets banned
Like it was me who put that switch in his hand
And told him to kill that man

Like this whole song was just some kinda sickly devised plan
To hurt some poor cunt I don't even know
And I've never met before in my life

The words whoever said, ""The pen is mightier than the sword""
Was right and you better think twice
Before you step to me and pick a fight

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

Over oceans, overdosing off the cultures of product
Toastin' this cut, react jazz cats be slappin' glasses
Surrender to the method, yes I've kept it Yard Massive status
Avalanche rap clientele from ambushing
We move quick wit new shit to get the fans pushin'
From out the dynast of the School Yard camp
We start gettin' the microphone just like two large amps
I'm tellin' it, whenever I'm posted with endo to blow
I aim at domes like Double-Oh-Seven, Nintendo 64

Hit y'all in throat, be lyrics of wide scope
Go tell your friends, demand the vote
These niggas playahatin', can't make Ras to go
Now, we show em how we elevate
From the gate, Asia plus the Ras, we frustrate
Fantasize, we bringin' it live, check the size
Of brothers enterprise, we breakin' out the sides
Eyes scan the room, but this two man platoon
All set to meet em at high noon

Yo I be ready to plug all of these thug type scrubs

While you be at the club tryin to step to hoes 
I'll be around the globe tryin to rock the shows 
However it goes I still maintain the spot 
But battlin Ras you gettin blown off the lot 
So wether or not y'all believe

Then watch niggas fall like leaves 
Breakin they breads 
Got 'em headin back to the homerange 
Now they tryin to summace they whole camp 
My lambshade ready to fade 
You better try to make a trade in the traff 
To help your wack staff 
Buried in the bath, my lyrics bubble and boil 
It's Kut Masta Kurt, Ras ready to spoil 
Now watch me uncall and bounce 
You only add to an ounce 
My pounds can cover ten miles of ground 
The most profound you ever seen 
So all that in-between shit 
Don't really mean shit 
The tighter the fit, the tighter it gets 
We cuttin off the air 
Sick of niggas with rhymes and no flair 
But all that fanfair can leave your head swoll

There's only one goal I got 
The shit's hot 
And to the contrary we still rock the spot

With teflon bullets that sendin 'em in the chest 
No need for stress 
All really had enough 
So bring on these niggas that think they bad enough

Appealin' when it's time to shine 
And tell my foes to eat a dick! 
I blow spots just like radical groups

I'm draining all of they battery juice 
To all my niggas livin' large, watch me 
Capitilze and invest in property 

While I'm still sellin' copies 
For the love of the art, this is where the bubblin' starts

Planet Asia,"""(spoken)Yo, so you know, all of a sudden, we're in front of the 
restaurant and she decides she wants to leave on her own.  
And I'm  like ""Just go!"" you know?  And then she, 
she gotta get something out the car 
she gotta do this she gotta do that...(/spoken)

Yo she was always trying to fight me
Kick me and bite me
I used to argue with her daily and nightly
Trying to excite me, saying shit to spite me
She said ""I know it isn't another girl!"" I said ""It might be.""
There really wasn't but I said it cause she hyped me.
I know she loved me but she act like she don't like me
And started gradually just trippin' on me slightly
All of a sudden, she stopped acting politely
I said ""Just kiss me instead of trying to dis me.
'Cause when I'm gone you'll be hollering you miss me.
You should just love me instead of trying to shove me.
Try to hug me instead of trying to bug me.""
She beautiful but be acting like she ugly
I know she dug me but why the hell she drug me
Through all the drama talking 'bout that she can kill me?
Be flashing on me, turn around and say ""You feel me?""
I'm like ""Yo, you ain't always got to grill me
You better tighten up before somebody steal me.""

CHORUS:

Why you be acting up, why you be showing out?
Why you be talking all loud when we in the house?
What's with the attitude? Why you like to run your mouth?
I guess you really don't know what it's all about.
You gots to BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Pack your bullshit and BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Gimme everything and BOUNCE

She was always trying to hold me
Shape me and mold me.
I never knew and nobody ever told me
Trying to control me just because she know me
She said ""If you love me like you tell me then you show me!""
I had to tell her that I dealt with her solely
It didn't matter 'cause she treated me so coldly
Tried to talk with her but she blocked it like a goalie
We was lovers before we was homies
I said support me instead of trying to short me
Outvote me or root beer float me
Misquote me or even scapegoat me
And after all that insult me?

CHORUS

(spoken)You know, we used to be close now you want to badmouth me 
and talk to your friends all crazy about what I do...(/spoken)

She was always trying to clown me
Sink me or drown me
Outthink outdrink and out-of-bound me.
I used to leave but I hated when she found me
But she got to everyone in the townie
I tried to duck from the drama that surround me
It's in my blood, I'm a king you got to crown me
The way she flipped the script on me was astounding
""Who do you think about when you say who found me?""
I should have taught her everytime I fought her
I never caught her and never tried to salt her
I wonder why our relationship falter
I guess we both have the kind of life you can't alter.
People should make up instead of trying to break up
Or just break up cause that can be a wake up
And when you wake up make sure you take up
A little time so you don't make a mistake up.

Take your (keys/cat/dog/silverware/dishes/old couch) and BOUNCE

I'm in this click, you in my hood you better know who you fucking with
Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
Nigga I'm at your door, don't pray to God cause you done lost your grace
Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face
I got the mind of a psycho ass ??
As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
I sold my soul at an early age
And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
My eyes in a daze
Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
Is juices running when ya done in
Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they
Dead
Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
Talking shit up in my territory
Another day another world's sad story

Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block
Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock
Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
Freeze your whole coalition
Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
This figure from head to toe
Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
You hoes ain't fucking with that
Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission
Trying to recondition your stilo

One other sequel from the infamous unseen
Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine

Verse 3 (Mia X)

Cause she up to schemes
Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
Mia's right and left well known with the clout
To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
That's what this here be bout
So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
Too much to deal with
I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
But I sees nothing but dollars
Feminist power
My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her

Heartless, like the department of the water and power
Yeah - fuck your hot showers, and while you watchin the fight
I cut your cable just to show who really got power
Now I'm, minutes from ass-kickin sessions
Asswipe, we tax niggaz like Pacific Gas & Electric
Bar spitter, {?} cigar splitter, tar getters
Hard-hitter hater niggaz want to war with us
But get your bars up, cause niggaz know about me
and they know about my squad, so as far as us
I ain't got to answer the shit, so if you see me in the club
keep your mouth closed and dance with a bitch
Cause I'm bout to be the hood philanthrophist; get down or lay down
And how I got up in the spot wasn't an accident
Just love blood tears and sweat, and large respect
And sixteen bars of death, yeah

Here to let y'all know that y'all give me inspiration to do what I do
And I ain't never gon' forget you, knahmsayin?
For as long as I'm alive

[verse One]
For all my peoples gone... from nine to five
As long as I'm alive my niggaz we gon', be strong
Now peep the song, the streets is gone, to each his own
From money spent to every song that I was featured on
It's for the block and we gon' keep it goin
For all my close friends gone, givin me energy to speak my poems
Rest in peace to the God Al Woods
Kept my self-esteem high since a child in the hood
I was raised on the Westside, wildin for goods
Same cats that used to kick it now be killin each other
Comin from different neighborhoods and not feelin each other
The way they used to loud talkin, last words is nigga I'll shoot you
The streets is eighty-five, cause nowadays you might get
popped in the back at the party tryin to flee to survive
For all my friends that travelled to the other side
You'll be forever on my mind as long as I'm alive

[Chorus]
(As long as I'm alive) Tell all my homies that I'm
lost in the storm, I'ma keep it movin on
(As long as I'm alive) You'll always have a piece of my heart
Piece of my mind, and a peace of my art
(As long as I'm alive) You shall forever be mourned
I'm thinkin bout y'all every mornin
(As long as I'm alive) I shall never forget
the good times and all the places we went

[Verse Two]
In high school you was my closest homey, although from different crews
We used to chop it up bout all the shit that we was into
From girls to guns, and situations in our circle
And it hurts everytime when I think about the day they merked you
You left a lonely spot
Broke down when I heard it like damn why they have to leave the homey shot?
My fond memories are commonly remembered
Good times and in my mind it's like I speak to you spiritually
And to my favorite Uncle Franklin Harper
You shall never be forgotten for as long as I'm alive and talkin
Inside a soul darkened, due to circumstances
These past years done had some friends of mine who died from cancer
It's messed up never knowin your chances
And Tammy I wish you was here so you could see how much we been advancin
And your management is much missed, but I know you watchin
Rest in peace, little Ann George and Les Watson
And I'll gladly sing this song with pride
Cause all y'all forever in my heart as long as I'm alive, you hear me?
I'll gladly sing this song with pride
Cause all y'all forever in my heart as long as I'm alive

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Your memory'll live on, with me you can trust
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
You're on my mind more for sure as time passes

[Verse Three]
Sometimes I find myself stressin, then realize at least I'm livin
So as long as I'm alive, it's for y'all I'm reppin
Until I'm back to the essence, and if it wasn't
for half of my peoples gone I probably wouldn't practice my profession
From all the gunfights, and white chalk, funerals wakes and white cops
Lockin my niggaz soon as the night pops off
Nowadays gotta be strong to survive

Lookin at us like we got food but kick rocks once the heaters move
But back to the song - miras move, c'mon

Damn girl!  Shake it then you go back it up
When God made you he gave the whole package
But don't trip - I was born to work it with no practice
No houses, no couches, no mattress
(Jayson you nasty!) That's what they tell me, but umm
Somehow they always end up at the telly, and umm
Somehow their good lookin friends start trailin
And inhale what's in the other room that they're smellin
Or trailin just because of what their homegirl was tellin
So, it's only right I keep it tight and take care of 'em
And, you can have 'em for the rest of your life
But I'm just tryin to have the rest of the night
Don't need no stress in my life
Don't need a person askin questions to fight
Speak not a word ma unless it's polite, 'fore I invest in a flight
Cause all I need is affection tonight

It's like the great {?} to who made the Egyptian scriptures
I'm spiritual cultivation the way my words entered your dome
No stoppin once the mission is known
You know the topic many prophets can't physically show 'em

And many different pedigrees sent from out the heavens to the chosen
So the struggle is maintain some integrity
And until it's over, I shall remain a soldier
Like Aztecs with aspects that they govern, it's on

want to live, you gotta eat from the tree
And reach the degree, the medicine for my peoples is history lost
And in religion, the mystery cost
Unofficially off brothers who be frosted mentally

Black man recognize the science of life
It's all you, right and exact, it's actual fact
It's all you, everything in existence
The sun the moon the stars the galaxy and every dimension

Fuck a pagan religion, let's look at the state of our livin
And I say it again for all my peoples layin in prison
Cause what's the cure if it don't change the condition?
If it's holy it's pure, undiluted in any form with no mixtures

Many claim a parable and scroll the scriptures
But what's the story if you never catch the whole adventure
And we want the facts right now
Or else we bout to turn America, upside down

[Chorus]

Poisonous nights, street life, police lights
A whole nation of men women and kids that don't eat right
It's freedom or death, kingmanship or slaves to success
And why the fuck I owe the government net?

They're puttin holes in my check
While undercovers put the holes in our chest from
Every corner to block they got us posin for death some
Get out of this, but most don't even know what the knowledge is

Children payin tuition to these brainwashed colleges
Still in the same position they had us and still got us in
Look at where all the problems begin
Where the problem begins, is when you motherfuckers try to pretend

And try to act like you ain't really bout the dollars and cents
A scholar was sent, to shed some proper knowledge and gems
More than Pradas and Timbs, papi came to father his kin
I came to add another part to the trend

And add the sword to the devil's lapel
Cause me and him could never have resemblance
Simply cause his level is Hell, never I fail
Never will and never shall, forever real

'Til my words, from now on, 'til I'm dirt
Forever with my five fingers put together puttin in work
I'm your black star power, the now or never shout of let's get free
Your scientist, the future of tomorrow has come

And we want some answers right now
Or else we bout to turn America, upside down

She told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine
In the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
Cause it's a poor man's girl, and I will never give love
To how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
Martin had a dream, nigga, I did too
To make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup
So, I took it that thaw, and hit the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids

Especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
Reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes in, the more I disappear

Off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling

Ten million hungry

Sell or be sold

Burning and looting till babylon break me

I can make it real, hold it down for you, feel you bleed
