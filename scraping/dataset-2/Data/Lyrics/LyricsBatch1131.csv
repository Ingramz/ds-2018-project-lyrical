Bill Evans Trio,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear",Spring Is Here,1996
Bill Evans Trio,"When the wintry winds start blowing
And the snow is starting to fall
Then my eyes turn westward knowing
That's the place that I love best of all

California, I've been blue
Since I've been away from you.
I can't wait till I get going
Even now I'm starting in a call

California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
Birdies sing and everything
A sun kissed miss said ""Don't be late!""
That's why I can hardly wait,
Open up that Golden Gate! 
California, here I come!

California, here I come, yeah!
Right where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
Birdies sing and everything
A sun kissed miss said ""Don't be late!""
That's why I can hardly wait
Open up, open up, open up that Golden Gate! 
California, here I come!","California, Here I Come",1997
Bill Evans Trio,"Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to

One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it's near you
One gal you're everything to

Fame, if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to

Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found her

Bill Evans Trio,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful [Live],2000

Bill Evans Trio,"Good mornin' mornin' glory
Good mornin' what's your story
Good mornin' where'd you spend the night
Where did your night dreams take you
Sorry but I had to wake you
Oh I just had to make you
Shed your precious mornin' light on me

Oh good mornin' sleepy baby
You know, I'm thinking maybe
I love you even more today
Every time you go to sleep
I'm jealous of the dreams
That keep you away from me

Good mornin' mornin' glory
I'll have to thank the sandman
For he's let you wake up in my arms again

Doo doo da doo doo doo doo

Oh, come on darling time to get up
I have your breakfast table set up
Its such a lovely morning to see
And I have my mornin' glory with me",Mornin' Glory,2002
Bill Evans Trio,"Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Bill Evans Trio,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too

Bill Evans Trio,"Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me and no one beside me
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will hide me
And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after

I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?",Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me),2002
Bill Evans Trio,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

Bill Evans Trio,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart [*],2006

Bill Evans Trio,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves [DVD],2007
Bill Evans Trio,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye,2009
Bill Evans Trio,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around,2009
Bill Evans Trio,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2010
Bill Evans Trio,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2010
Bill Evans Trio,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

And your children will fear at his name

And you go out and walk to the Christ",Time of the Last Persecution,1971

They're telling me something I think so

Out of place as a cryin' clown who could only frown and the play went on for hours

One love who would stand by me and after making love we'd...

We'd dream a bunch of friends
Dream each others smile

I was not myself last night in the morning light I could see the change was showing
Like a child who was always poor reaching out for more I could feel the hunger growing
And as I lost control I swore I'd sell my soul for one love
Who would sing my song and fill this emptiness inside me
One love who would sing my song and lay beside me while we'd...


Dream a bit of style
We'd dream a bunch of friends
Dream each others smile
And dream it never ends

All my tears have dried and I can't weep

Rest in peace, and dream, dream it never ends",Faust,1974
Bill Flores,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Bill Flores,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2001
Bill Frisell,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye,1988

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

That I would rather be.

Bill Gaither,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages 
On that line stands an old rugged cross 
On that cross, a battle is raging 
To gain a man's soul or it's loss 

On one side, march the forces of evil
 All the demons, all the devils of hell 
On the other, the angels of glory 
And they meet on Golgotha's hill 

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict 
And the sun refuses to shine 
For there hangs God's son, in the balance 
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over 
It is finished, there'll be no more war 
It is finished, the end of the conflict 
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging 
Not all prisoners of war had come home 
These were battlefields of my own making 
I didn't know that the war had been won 

Oh, but then I heard the king of the ages 
Had fought all the battles for me 
And that victory was mine for the claiming

Bill Gaither,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages
On that line stands an old rugged cross
On that cross, a battle is raging
Or the gain a man's soul or it's loss

On one side, march the forces of evil
All the demons, and all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory
And they meet on Golgotha's hill

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict
And the sun refuses to shine
There hangs God's son, in the balance
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over
It is finished, there'll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was raging
Not all prisoners of war had come home
These were battlefields of my own making
I didn't know that the war had been won

Then I heard the king of the ages
Had fought all the battles for me
And that victory was mine for the claiming
And now praise his name, I am free

Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart

I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

Bill Gaither,"Deep within the heart has always known that there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul of life
The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it
There's something that keeps reaching for the sky

And even life begins because a baby fights for freedom
And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme
Some have walked through fire and flood to find a place of freedom
And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever minds know what it means to be in chains
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing, let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

I'll sing it out with every breath, I'll let the whole world hear it
This hallelujah anthem of the free
That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came

He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward

Thank you for giving to the Lord

Bill Gaither,"Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
Why we pull away from each other so easily
Even though we're all walking the same road
Yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves

But I, I don't care what label you may wear
If you believe in Jesus you belong with me
The bond we share is all I care to see
And we can change this world forever
If you will join with me, join and sing

Oh you're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

The day will come when we will be as one
And with a mighty voice together
We will proclaim that Jesus, Jesus is King
And it will echo through the earth
It will shake the nations and the world will see, see that

You're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

The time is here, the time is now
To take a stand, to make a vow
I won't let go, you're not alone
Now and forever we'll sing together

You're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

I just wanna testify.
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received.
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me 
Looked around and can't ignore, there's so many things to be thankful for.
And I just wanna testify
I got a joy that comes from within, deep in my soul I feel so content
And I just wanna testify
I searched high and I searched low, to find the answers only Heaven holds
And I just wanna testify
Too much joy, can't keep it to myself, I feel the need to tell somebody else
And I just wanna testify

Bill Gaither,"There are many people, who will say they're Christians
And they live like Christians on the Sabbath day
But come Monday morning, till the coming Sunday
They will fight their neighbor all along the way

Oh you don't love God
If you don't love your neighbor
If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble, and you don't try to help him
Then you don't love your neighbor
And you don't love God

In the holy Bible, in the book of Matthew
Read the 18th chapter in the 21st verse
Jesus plainly tells us that we must have mercy
There's a special warning in the 35th verse

Oh you don't love God
If you don't love your neighbor
If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble, and you don't try to help him
Then you don't love your neighbor
And you don't love God

There's a God Almighty, and you've got to love him
If you want salvation and a home on high
If you say you love him while you hate your neighbor
Then you don't have religion, you just told a lie

Oh you don't love God
If you don't love your neighbor
If you gossip about him, if you never have mercy
If he gets into trouble, and you don't try to help him
Then you don't love your neighbor
And you don't love God

It?s not a dream, God will make all things new that day

Evil is banished to eternal hell

No more tears, never crying again
And praises to the great, ""I AM""

Bill Gaither,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.

Bill Gaither,"The Bible it tells us in God's words so true
The sweet Holy Spirit is promised to you
It sat upon Jesus in the form of a dove
When John was baptizing God's dearly beloved

Sweet Holy Spirit I'm down on my knees
I am low in the valley, I am so weak you see
But I know I can make it, for I trust in thee
The sweet Holy Spirit is falling on me

Sweet Holy Spirit, oh how I love Thee
For being a comfort so many times and for strengthening me
For I could not make it across life's troubled sea
If the sweet Holy Spirit should ever leave me

Sweet Holy Spirit I'm down on my knees

All the dead that are in them,

Out of great tribulation
They have washed their robes
In the blood of the Lamb,
They have gone through much sorrow
Into great jubilation,
They're redeemed by the blood of the Lamb

Their voices are ringing
The great cloud of witnesses
Sings freedom's song
As they enter the country
Built by their own Father,
The promised homeland
They've looked for so long

And your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes
And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fear

Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you
Serve only to remind you, that they drop powerless behind you
When you praise Him

Now, Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think
That we are paupers, when he knows himself we're children of the King
So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won
We know that Jesus Christ has risen and the work's already done

About an old man I met,
He said,Boy, you look in trouble,
And I bet your life's a mess,
He said, I used to have the same problem too,
I was way out of control,
You know the only thing that set it right for me,
Was a little good old rock and roll,

(Chorus 1)
I put my feet on the rock,
And my name on the roll,
When it's called up yonder,
I won't worry 'bout my soul,
I know my home is waiting,
And it's something to behold,
I put my feet on the rock,
And my name on the roll,

(Verse 2)
I'd never heard the gosple,
Spread like that before,
I guess the message comes in many ways,
Those simple words of wisdom,
Can open heaven's door,
So every time I get the chance I say,

Come on, put your feet on the rock,
And your name on the roll,
When it's called up yonder,

You know your home is waiting,
And it's something to behold,
So put your feet on the rock,
And your name on the roll,

Just as I was without one plea, Sweet Jesus came and rescued me-And I heard it first on the radio. ~ Alas, and did my Savior bleed, That captive spirits could be freed, And I heard it first on the radio. My soul has found a resting place, Until I meet Him face to face-And I heard it first on the radio. I love to tell the story true, And those who know still love it, too; Oh, what a precious Friend we have in Him! And when in glory saints will tell, 'Twill be the theme they love so well-And we heard it first on the radio. ~ Tag: Na na na na na na na, Na na na na na na na. And I heard it first on the radio. Na na na na na na na, Na na na na na na na. And I heard it first on the radio. I heard it first on the radio. And I heard it first on the radio.

",I Heard It First on the Radio,2008
Bill Gaither,"There's a voice now missing in our little country choir 
Rock of Ages will never sound the same 
God heard her singing heaven was not complete 
Now Mama's teaching angels how to sing 

Mama's teaching angels how to sing 
Heaven's halls are silent when Mama sings 
David lays down his harp and heaven's bells won't ring 
When Mama's teaching angels how to sing 

The old home it's now empty it's lonesome since she's gone 
And it's hard to know she won't return again 
But I'll meet her in that morning on heaven's golden hills 
Where Mama's teaching angels how to sing

Bill Gaither,"Well a woman was healed when she touched the hem of his clothes
That's just one of those stories that everybody knows
Oh I know the facts but I'd love to feel 
What the blind man felt when his eyes were healed
He went running through the streets to share

I wish I could have been there
When the thousands were fed with just two fish and some bread and see the little boy a packin' up the rest 
I wish I could have been there
To see the lame that could leap and hear the dumb that could speak and see the multitudes of people Jesus blessed
I wish I could have seen the stone that went a rollin' away when they looked inside the door to where the grave clothes lay
I didn't see but I believe that he ascended in the air
And I really wish I could have been there

When He commanded Lazarus to walk right out of His grave
And in a Galilean storm He started calming the waves
I wanna feel that breeze blowing on my face
I wanna know the smell I wanna taste the taste
Just reading 'bout it couldn't compare",I Wish I Could Have Been There,2009
Bill Gaither,"I never said that I would give you silver or gold
Or that you would never feel the fire or shiver in the cold
But I did say you'd never walk through this world alone
(Hmm)
And I did say, don't make this world your home

I never said that fear wouldn't find you in the night
Or that loneliness was something you'd never have to fight
But I did say I'd be right there by your side
And I did say I'll always help you fight

'Cause you know I made a promise that I intend to keep
My grace will be sufficient in every time of need
And my love will be the anchor that you can hold onto
This is the promise, this is the promise I made to you

I never said that friends would never turn their backs on you
Or that the world around you wouldn't see you as a fool
But I did say like me you'll surely be despised
And I did say my ways confound the wise

I didn't say you'd never taste the bitter kiss of death
Or have to walk through chilly Jordan to enter into rest
But I did say I'd be waiting right on the other side
(Yeah, yeah)
And I did say I'll dry every tear you cry

'Cause you know I made a promise that I've prepared a place
And some day sooner than you think you'll see me face to face
And you'll sing with the angels and a countless multitude
This is the promise, this is the promise I've made to you

So just keep on walkin', don't turn to the left or right
And in the midst of darkness, let this be your light
That hell can't separate us and you're gonna make it through
This is the promise, this is the promise I made to you",The Promise,2009

Let Your sweet aroma fill my life
Rose of Sharon, show me
How to grow in beauty in God's sight

Fairest of ten thousand
Make me a reflection of Your light
Daystar, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door
Let Your word speak to me
Show me what I've never seen before

Lord, I want to be Your witness
You can take what's wrong and make it right
Daystar, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lord, I've seen a world that's dying
Wounded by the master of deceit
Groping in the darkness
Haunted by the years of past defeat

But then I see You standing near me, Lord
Shining with compassion in Your eyes
I pray, Jesus, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door
Let Your word speak to me
Show me what I've never seen before

Bill Gaither,"Above His name there is no other name
The one who is eternally the same
There is no other name

The first and last, beginning and the end
He was the King who made the common man His friend
There is no other name, let every tongue proclaim
And sing the name of Jesus

Magnify and praise the name of Jesus
No other name but Jesus
There is power in the precious name of Jesus, Jesus
Messiah, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Jesus

He created all there is with his own hands
And yet the smallest need He understands
There is no other name

The one who said, ""I am the great I am""
And then He gave Himself, a sacrifice for man
There is no other name, let every tongue proclaim
And sing the name of Jesus

Magnify and praise the name of Jesus
No other name but Jesus

Bill Gaither,"Deep within the heart has always known that there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul of life
The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it
There's something that keeps reaching for the sky

And even life begins because a baby fights for freedom
And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme
Some have walked through fire and flood to find a place of freedom
And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever minds know what it means to be in chains
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing, let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

I'll sing it out with every breath, I'll let the whole world hear it
This hallelujah anthem of the free
That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring down through the ages from a hill called Calvary
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
You can be free and you can sing let freedom ring
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

And things I could not understand.
Many times in trials my weakness blurs my vision 
And that's when my frustration gets so out of hand.

I've never had to stand one test alone.
As I look at all the victories, the Spirit rises up in me.
And It's through the fire my weakness is made strong.

And the hill would not be hard to climb.
He never offered a victory without fighting.

For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore

And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine

Those kind gentle words
Asking what was her reason for tears
And I sobbed in despair

I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;

It is now (if ever I love my Saviour, 'tis now etc)

The pockets of the gamblers will soon miss Jesse's money

And tell how much Jesse took up with little Jim
Now Jimmy's got a daddy and Jesse's got a family

All the demons, all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory

And the sun refuses to shine
For there hangs God's son, in the balance

It is finished, there'll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging

These were battlefields of my own making

Had fought all the battles for me

We've got inflation licked I'll get right back to you
It's just a standard form tomorrow without fail
Pleased to meet you, thanks a lot, your check is in the mail

Marooned, marooned, marooned in a blizzard of lies
Marooned, marooned, marooned in a blizzard of lies
Your toes and knees aren't all you'll freeze

When you're in it up to your thighs
It looks like snow but you never know
When you're marooned in a blizzard of lies

You may have won a prize, won't wrinkle, shrink or peel
Your secret's safe with me, this is a real good deal
It's finger lickin' good, strictly by the book
What's fair is fair, I'll be right there, I am not a crook

Marooned, marooned, marooned in a blizzard of lies
Marooned, marooned, marooned in a blizzard of lies
Better watch your step when your old dog Shep

Can't even look you in the eyes
You're cold and lost and you're double crossed
When you're marooned in a blizzard of lies

We'll send someone right out, now this won't hurt a bit
He's in a meeting now, the coat's a perfect fit
It's strictly fresh today, service with a smile
I'll love you, darling, 'til I die, we'll keep your name on file

Marooned, marooned, marooned in a blizzard of lies

And you're in for a big surprise

Bill Goodwin,"I'm impressed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

On the dotted line

An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see and I believe that you are there

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

Finding another world.

Bill Haley,"Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And he would be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights

Ain't nothing you can do about the dough that you lack
But beat it right back to the track, Jack

So I shout 'Whateva!' and she said 'Shut up, you're an idiot!'

Were never to be

And the leaves came tumbling down 

I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark 
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin' in the dark 
It was Stagger Lee and Billy, two men who gambled late 
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight 

Stagger Lee told Billy, I cant let you go with that 
You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat 
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four 
Said Im goin' to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe 
Go Stagger Lee! 

Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door 
He said Nobody move and he pulled his forty-four 
Stagger Lee, cried Billy, Oh, please don't take my life 
I got three little children and a very sickly wife

Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Why can't I free your doubtful mind

That you belonged to me

Correction Notes:

Oh, what a crazy party all the gang's here, too 
The beat is really jumping like a kangaroo 
I'm full of cherry soda and potato chips 
But now I want to get a taste of your sweet lips 

So, dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphere !! 
The furniture is bouncing round the room with glee 
And rocking like a boat upon a stormy sea 
But, dig the crazy pockets on the pile tonight 
But still I haven't had a chance to hold you tight 

Look at Annie's earrings bouncing off her backs 
Look at Suzie kissing and a-hugging Jack 
Looking Nancy dancing in her stocking feet
We're all going crazy with the mambo beat !!! 
But, everybody's really having lots of fun 
But, honey as for me the night has just begun 
Cause now I want to tell you things and hold you tight 
But, how can I do it with the room so bright ?","Dim, Dim the Lights (I Want Some Atmosphere)",1999

If you love somebody enough
Then you go where your heart needs to go
That's how I got to Memphis

You'd tell me cause you are my friend
I've got to find her
And find out the trouble she's in
If you tell me she isn't here
I'll follow by the trail of her tears
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
She' use to get mad and she'd say
She'd go back to Memphis someday
That's how I got to Memphis

Bill Haley,"There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye for evermore

There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door",There Goes My Everything,1999

I'm troubled in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always

Take my old rockin' chair
If the blues don't take me
Gonna rock away from here

On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two nineteen

What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?

I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue

Bill Haley,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,1999

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

Go Johnny Go

And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.

Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And he would be the leader of a big old band.

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

You reach your destination but alas in a lack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the rack
And read the situation from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
You put it right back in the rack, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life of Riley in the beaten-down shack
So when I hear the whistle I can peep through the crack
And watch the train a-rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
I just love the rhythm of the clickety-clack
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo ch'boogie

Oh, what a crazy party all the gang's here, too 
The beat is really jumping like a kangaroo 
I'm full of cherry soda and potato chips 
But now I want to get a taste of your sweet lips 

So, dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphere !! 
The furniture is bouncing round the room with glee 
And rocking like a boat upon a stormy sea 
But, dig the crazy pockets on the pile tonight 
But still I haven't had a chance to hold you tight 

Look at Annie's earrings bouncing off her backs 
Look at Suzie kissing and a-hugging Jack 
Looking Nancy dancing in her stocking feet
We're all going crazy with the mambo beat !!! 
But, everybody's really having lots of fun 
But, honey as for me the night has just begun 
Cause now I want to tell you things and hold you tight 
But, how can I do it with the room so bright ?","Dim, Dim the Lights",1991
Bill Haley & His Comets,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Bill Haley & His Comets,"The Dipsy Doodle is the thing to beware
The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
The things you say will come out in reverse
Like ""You love I and me love you""
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

The Dipsy Doodle is easy to find
It's almost always in back of your mind
You never know it until it's too late
And then you're in such a terrible state
Like ""The moon jumped over the cow, hey diddle""
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

When you think that you're crazy
You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
But it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle

You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
You'll think you're crazy, all the things that you say
Like ""Rockin' not I and rollin' goodbye""
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

Well, when you think you're crazy
You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
But it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle

You better listen and try to be good

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down

Three days later, awe at the turk she started feelin' down

So I shout 'Whateva!' and she said 'Shut up, you're an idiot!' 

Tube up-n-down the river, we were cruising' for a bruisin'
Oh, the feeling I felt that perfect day in Wade
It's the kind of fuzzy feeling can't be said but only felt
So perfect just right and ain't no words can ever do justice

Bill Haley & His Comets,"Last night I was dreaming, dreamed about the H-bomb
Well, the bomb went off and I was caught
I was the only man on the ground
There was a-thirteen women and only one man in town
Thirteen women and only one man in town
And as funny as it may be
The one and only man in town was me
Well, thirteen woman and me the only man around

I had two girls every morning
Seeing that I was well fed
And believe you me, one sweetened my tea
While another one buttered my bread
Two girls gave me my money
Two girls made me my clothes
And another sweet thing, bought me a diamond ring
About forty carats I suppose
Well, thirteen women and only one man in town
There was a-thirteen women and only one man in town
It was something I can't forget
Because I think of those thirteen women yet
Well, thirteen woman and only one man around

I had three girls dancing the mambo
Three girls balling the jack
And all of the rest really did their best
Boy, they sure were a lively pack
I thought I was in heaven
And all of these angels were mine
But I woke up and ended the dream
'Cause I had to get to work on time
Well, a-thirteen women and only one man in town
There was a-thirteen women and only one man in town
No, I can't tell you where I've been
'Cause I kind of think that someday I'll go back again
To those thirteen women and me the only man around
Well, a-thirteen women and me the only man around

Correction Notes:

Oh, what a crazy party all the gang's here, too 
The beat is really jumping like a kangaroo 
I'm full of cherry soda and potato chips 
But now I want to get a taste of your sweet lips 

So, dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphere !! 
The furniture is bouncing round the room with glee 
And rocking like a boat upon a stormy sea 
But, dig the crazy pockets on the pile tonight 
But still I haven't had a chance to hold you tight 

Look at Annie's earrings bouncing off her backs 
Look at Suzie kissing and a-hugging Jack 
Looking Nancy dancing in her stocking feet
We're all going crazy with the mambo beat !!! 
But, everybody's really having lots of fun 
But, honey as for me the night has just begun 
Cause now I want to tell you things and hold you tight 
But, how can I do it with the room so bright ?",Dim Dim the Lights,2006

happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
bein' the father he wanted to be
close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came
an' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame
an' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again!

Off through the woods we're ridin' along
makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a be	'are an' twict as strong
an' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
an' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise!

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
in his heart he wanted to leave it all
an' lose himself in the forests tall
but he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign!

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind
They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
sent up to Nashville the best they could find
a fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier!

The votes were counted an' he won hands down
so they sent him off to Washin'ton town
with his best dress suit still his buckskins brown
a livin' legend of growin' renown
Davy, Davy Crockett, the Canebrake Congressman!

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
an' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand
an' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow!

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

When he come home his politickin' done
the western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer!

He heard of Houston an' Austin so
to the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
an' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

His land is biggest an' his land is best
from grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test
followin' his legend into the West
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

There's really nothin' much to do

It's then I get to thinkin'
I must have gone insane.

Bill Holcombe,"Hmm, c'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 

Oh, c'est si bon
So I say it to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh-so good, ba-ba-doo, doo day

Every word, every sigh
Every kiss, dear 
Leads to only one thought 
And it's this, dear!
 
Hmm, it's so good
Nothing else can replace 
Just your slightest embrace 
And if you only would
Be my own
For the rest of my days 
I will whisper this phrase 
My darling, c'est si bon, oui oui!",C'Est Si Bon,1952
Bill Holcombe,"Hey, baby, how about this dance?
Why?
'Cause it takes two to do this dance

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone

But

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

You can stare at the moon by yourself
Take a laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot, go to pot on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone

But, listen here

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

Oh, see0",It Takes Two to Tango [*],1952
Bill Holcombe,"Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak 
Angels sing from above
Every day words 
Seems to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be 
La vie en rose",La Vie en Rose,1952
