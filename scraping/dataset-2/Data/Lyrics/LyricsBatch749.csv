Moriarty,"Mon ami est parti
L'est parti pour toujours
Mais moi je suis en vie
Fais battre ton tambour

Fais-le bouger ce corps
Donne-lui du bonheur
Que demain je danse encore
Et que je n'aie plus peur

Fais battre ton tambour
Fais-moi danser
Qu'il sonne ton tambour
Jusque dans mes pieds

Je sens les larmes qui montent
Mais je vais pas pleurer
Je sens ma peine qui gronde
Je vais la chanter

Come and take my pain away
Come and take my pain away

Fais battre ton tambour
Fais-moi danser
Qu'il sonne ton tambour
Jusque dans mes pieds

J'ai la gorge qui se serre
Mais je vais pas pleurer
Je sens monter la colère
L'envie de crier

Je veux tordre le cou à ce mal
Ce mal qui me dévore
Je tape sur mon corps
Je tape, je tape encore

Je sens les larmes qui coulent
Mais je vais pas pleurer
Je sens la vie qui s'écroule
Je vais la chanter

Come and take my pain away
Come and take my pain away",Fais Battre Ton Tambour,2009
Moriarty,"Venez dans ma maison
Elle est belle
Elle a tant de floraisons
Qu'on y oublie le mal que les gens nous font
Dans ma maison

Venez dans ma maison
Venez prendre le large, manger l'horizon
Toucher le ciel
Venez dans ma maison
N'ayez pas peur
J'ai mis dans ma maison
Vos âmes sœurs

Venez dans ma maison
On y oublie le mal que les gens nous font
Dans ma maison

Moriarty,"The toad is standing on the water lily
La princesse ne veut pas l'embrasser
Le crapaud est sur le nénuphar
The princess thinks that he is so bizarre

Je trouve que ta peau n'a pas l'air très lisse
Pretty please I only need a kiss
Ta langue est si longue qu'elle attrape les mouches
Oh, je t'en prie, ne sois pas si farouche!

Il veut juste un petit bout
Un tout petit bout d'amour c'est tout

If you kiss me I will marry you
Mon prince ne vous ressemble pas du tout
Un baiser de vous changerait tout
But I could never fall in love with you
Mon bien-aimé ne peut pas être laid
Kiss me please et puis je m'en vais
I'll close my eyes and I will kiss you once
I never brought my lips so close to love

Il veut juste un petit bout
Un tout petit bout d'amour c'est tout

In the book, the toad did get the kiss
And became a prince
Dans le livre, on dit que le baiser
Sur le crapaud si laid
Fit naître un prince de toute beauté

In the song, the story's not the same
La chanson n'est pas tout à fait pareille
When the toad got the beauty's kiss
Quand la belle eut subi le supplice

Rien n'avait changé sous le soleil
The toad was ugly it was all the same
Un peu déçue, la princesse quitte l'étang
The toad was smiling
Il était content

Il veut juste un petit bout
Un tout petit bout d'amour c'est tout",The Princess and the Toad,2009
Moriarty,"Was on the high high holy day
The best day of the year
Little Matty Groves went to church
A gospel for to hear
A gospel for to hear

And first to come down was dressed in green
And the second one dressed in red
The third to come down was Lord Daniel's wife
Just as fair as any queen
Just as fair as any queen

Then Matty Groves says to one of his men
See the fair one dressed in white
Although she is Lord Daniel's wife
I'll be with her tonight
I'll be with her tonight

And little foot page he was standing by
And heard all that was said
He says Lord Daniel shall know tonight
Before I go to bed
Before I go to bed

He had fifteen miles for to go that night
And ten of them he run
He run 'til he come to the broke down bridge
Then he bent to his breast and he swum
He bent to his breast and he swum

He swum 'til he come to where the grass was green
Then took to his feet and he run
He run 'til he come to Lord Daniel's Gate
Then he rattled at the bells and he rung
He rattled at the bells and he rung

What news, what news, what news
What news have you brung
Little Matty Groves is in your bed with your wife
And their hearts both beat as one
Their hearts both beat as one

Now if the truth you've told me
A rich man you shall be
But if a lie you've told to me
I'll hang you to a tree
I'll hang you to a tree

Then he gathered him up about fifty good men
And he done it with a free good will
Then he popped his bugle to his mouth
And he blowed it loud and shrill
He blowed it loud and shrill

I'd better get up said little Matty Groves
I'd better get up and go
I know your husband is coming home
I hear his bugle blow
I hear his bugle blow

Lay down, lay down my precious one
Lay down and go to sleep
It's only my father's shepherd's horn
And he's a calling for his sheep
He's a calling for his sheep

So they laid down together again
And soon were fast asleep
When they awoke it was broad daylight
Lord Daniel at their feet
Lord Daniel at their feet

Get up from there you naked man
And put you on some clothes
I never intend for to have it said
That a naked man I slaught
That a naked man I slaught

Then Matty Groves struck the very first lick
And he wounded Lord Daniel sore
Lord Daniel struck the very next lick
And he drove Matty Groves to the floor
He drove Matty Groves to the floor

Then he taken his lady by the hand
And he sat her on his knee
And he says now which do you love the best
Little Matty Groves or me
Little Matty Groves or me

Very well I like your rosy cheeks
Very well I like your chin
But better I love little Matty Groves
Than you and all of your kin
Than you and all of your kin

You can dig my grave on a pretty green hill
And dig it wide and deep
And put little Matty Groves in my arms
Lord Daniel at my feet
Lord Daniel at my feet

You can dig my grave on a pretty green hill
And dig it wide and deep
And put little Matty Groves in my arms
Lord Daniel at my feet
Lord Daniel at my feet",Matty Groves,2013
Morifade,"Form a circle, join the line
The spirits of the night beat time
Satan's fiddle strikes the bow
Start the dance around they go

Face to face with destiny
Let their wildest dreams run free
Ecstasy fills their minds
They are damned until the end of time

Dance...You're loosing control
Dance...He's stealing your soul
Dance with the devil

Sold their souls, Satan's slaves
Now the devil must be paid
The music holds them in its spell
They'll soon be dancing now in hell",Dance With the Devil,2004
Moritz Garth,"Ich kann nicht ohne dich und auch nicht mit dir
Weiß nicht warum wir's immer wieder neu probieren
Selbst unsere Freunde können schon lang nicht mehr verstehen
Dass wir uns immer wieder nur im Kreis drehen

Aber wenn du nicht da bist, bin ich auf Entzug
Kann einfach nicht schlafen und fühl mich nicht gut
Und obwohl ich ja weiß, dass es nicht funktioniert
Ey, ich bin schon auf den Weg zu dir

Denn ich bin wie ein Bumerang
Ich komm zurück zu dir ein Leben lang
Egal wohin du gehst, du ziehst mich an
Wie ein Bumerang komm ich immer wieder bei dir an

Flieg über Wälder, über Wüsten und das Meer
Doch meinen Kuss zu halten, fällt mir leider schwer
Versuch mit aller Kraft dagegen anzukämpfen
Doch die Physik findet mal wieder ihre Grenzen

Aber wenn du nicht da bist, bin ich auf Entzug
Kann einfach nicht schlafen und fühl mich nicht gut
Und obwohl ich ja weiß, dass es nicht funktioniert
Ey, ich bin schon auf den Weg zu dir

Denn ich bin wie ein Bumerang
Ich komm zurück zu dir ein Leben lang
Egal wohin du gehst, du ziehst mich an

Mörk Gryning,"Midnight six sixty six
Torment beastial sex
Mother screaming in pain
Father rules hell's domain
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Danger gold pentagram
Sacrifice full blooded ram
Karma Hell bears its child
Reaper sharpens his scythe
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Hail Satanic Majesties
Sabbath my crucifix

Danger possessed by hell
Master cast me a spell

Morley,"High above change
Lifted up, feet upon the land
Far below sky
Curling up in his mother's hands

I see cold showers
And prayers that she used to know
Piece him together
For each stitch is borrowed

High low, high low
I wish I could help you win
High low, high low
I pray visions of heaven

I was the one
I held him close whenever he came near
Believing my love
Could out run his fear

My dove is in a cage
Brown paper bags of money to waste
Singing that God
Sheds the tears I taste

High low, high low
I wish I could help you win
High low, high low
I pray visions of heaven

Up and up we're free to grow
I see you, your glory sold
You've fallen to my love of everything

I'm not surprised
What more could the cards ask
My brilliant warrior
Armed without a task

Soon there'll be flowers
And prayers that I used to know
Lifting forever
As you watch how we let you go

High low, high low
I never could help you win
High low, high low
My perfect vision of heaven of my love

[Incomprehensible]
I wish I could help you win
[Incomprehensible]
Open arms receiving you

",High-Low,1998
Morley,"Love me when nobody else can see
Touch my soul, then treat me like I am a stranger
This is not the way I want to feel
Should have known a love this strong
Would bring some danger

But if it's all in my head
I'll find a way to make it end
It's magic and it's tragic

Slingshots whisper my teardrops an answer
What am I to you
Slingshots, you forgot my kisses, don't miss this
What am I to you

Shame, how you got me
Ripping words off my lips to keep from asking
I fall when you call
Press my ear against the phone to hear your lips move

I guess it's all in my head
And in time I'll make amends
It's magic but it's so tragic

I want you so bad
What's wrong with me, baby
I want you so bad
What's wrong with, with you, baby

Love me when nobody else can see
Touch my soul, then you treat me like a stranger
This is not the way I like to feel
I should have known a love this strong
Would bring some danger

Slingshots whisper my teardrops an answer
What am I to you
Slingshots, you forgot my kisses, don't miss this
What am I to you, you
Slingshots, you forgot my kisses, don't miss this
What am I to you

",Slingshots,1998
Morley & Gearhart,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
Mormon Tabernacle,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low

I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:

Gath'ring winter fuel

""Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""

Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""

Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.""

Forth they went together

And the bitter weather

And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

Shining in the East beyond them far

And so it continued both day and night.

Three Wise men came from country far

And to follow the star wherever it went.

What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last
Gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the
Perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly
Streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still
There.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'T is the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps'
Pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued
Land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a
Nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""

That floats and falls from off the twisted bough
To lie and faint within your silken bosom

Or would I were a little burnish'd apple
For you to pluck me, gliding by so cold
While sun and shade you robe of lawn will dapple
Your robe of lawn, and you hair's spun gold.

Yeah, would to God I were among the roses
That lean to kiss you as you float between
While on the lowest branch a bud uncloses
A bud uncloses, to touch you, queen.
Nay, since you will not love, would I were growing
A happy daisy, in the garden path
That so your silver foot might press me going
Might press me going even unto death.","Londonderry Air (Danny Boy), folk song",1996

The innocence of youth
Maybe only in their blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
And right would always win

Since I felt the same way I did
Last week or weeks before
I implur

If you could only see my heart exploding
The blood and gore as my soul lays on the floor
Inside you I could never breath again
Wearing my heart on my sleeve

The beacon faded just like our love
I wish I knew what happened so I could fix it
The damper on our relationship 
The pieces of the puzzle no longer fit 

I've become what I hate
Suddle little hints I'm on the other side of the fense for once
My thoughts of myself haunt me everyday
Inside you I could never breath again

Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
I don't know my next move to make
Once again living in checkmate

I hate being this stupid kid and everything that you did
Was so perfect, it's my fault I know
It's my fault I know
It's my fault I know

Inside you I could never breath again
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
Tied in these chains wishing the pain would go away

Never successful, never knew what real love was before
I mean it when I say I wish it was like it was
So much is going through my head
Regretting every word I said

I still love you, don't want anything to happen to you
Laying in my bed for hours and hours the pain won't..fucking..go away
How the hell am I suppose to be happy if your not?
Inside you I could never breath again

The beacon faded just like our love

Pure pleasure or from the heart. 
Just another addiction.

Or will I make the same mistakes. 
Confusing love and physical lust. 
I continue to let it trap me. 
Restrained... By my own actions 
Restrained... without emotion.

Out to sea.

And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes
And red balloons
So I called up my local deejay
And he didn't have a lot to say
But the radio
Has learned all of my favourite tunes.

No handles on the doors just a beautiful driver up front

Caressing the most passing of scenes with photographic love
Passionate photographic love
Venerable as anyone knew
His memories pull shades up and down
Doors are not done telegrams arrive
Every morning something extra ???
Remembering everything like a snatch of melody
A drumbeat remembering mythologizing

For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say
 
Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Listen to the rice when the wind blows 'cross the water

And it's plain to see, I've nothing to show
I'm glad to pay those union dues,
Just don't judge me by my shoes

And pretty soon a carnival on the edge of town
King Harvest has surely come

My whole barn went up in smoke
Our horse Jethro, well he went mad
And I can't remember things bein' that bad

Tellin' us our hard times are about to end
And then, if they don't give us what we like

Morris,"It was in those wonder-lust years, after I'd just left school,
That I first started to notice the change in everything.
I realised that the people I'd known all my life, (Take a long hard look,)
My family and friends were all just like strange little islands. (around the world you've helped to build.)
I didn't know who they were any more than I knew myself. (A Techni-colour wide-screen hell,)
It was at this point that I just started to drift. (beyond your window sill.)
A small balloon escaping from a child's hand. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

I withdrew from all social activity quite dramatically,
Never seeing anybody unless I absolutely had to.
For the first 8 and a half months, (God-forsaken,)
I saw no-one except the guy who worked in the all-night petrol station. (belly-aching,)
And that suited me just fine. (low-life parasite.)
I dreamt of never having to go outside for any reason again, ever. (So much angry cynicism,)
Of being buried in my house with all my stuff, (so much angst and spite.)
Like a huge asbestos sarcophagus. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

And I know what you're thinking,
'This guy needs to get out a bit more. Make contact.'
But that's not it. You see,
Since I've been away from other people,
Lots of things have improved in my life.
I'm a much better individual, thank you.

The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house, goodbye stairs
I was born here
And I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here

Love at first sight
It may sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the detail
Of everything you ever wore or said
Or how you stood the day
As we spent the last night
On Maudlin Street
""Goodbye house, forever!""
I never stole a happy hour
Around here

Where the world's ugliest boy
Became what you see
Here I am - the ugliest man
Oh, the last night on Maudlin Street
Truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you

When I sleep
With that picture of you framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room, by the bed
(...yes, I told you it was silly...)

And I know
I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh, truly I love you
Came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
But, you know
No-one stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches
All around my head

Oh, the last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So he drove me home in the Van
Complaining, ""Women only like me for my mind...""
Don't leave your torch behind
A powercut ahead; 1972, you know

And so we crept through the park
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline
For you
But you...without clothes
Oh, I could not keep a straight face
Me - without clothes?
Well, a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed

I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
With ""every hand waves me on""
(secretly wishing me gone)
Well, I will be soon
Ooh, I will be soon
I will be soon
I will be soon
Will be soon, I will be soon
Mmm...I will be soon, I will be soon

There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Inspector - don't you know?
Don't you care?
Don't you know - about love?

Your gran died
And your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain, and ashamed
With never time to say
Those special things...oh
I took the key from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar!

Blitz them all back to the Stone Age
The American way displayed proudly
Is to show lots of teeth and talk loudly

Just because the land weeps oil

Oh

I hug the land, but nothing more
Because I haven’t met you

Pressing palms and executing charms
But never in arms

Wrap your legs around my face just to greet me

Stop watching the news
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own

I spent the day in bed
It's a consolation
When all my dreams
Are perfectly legal
In sheets for which I paid
I am now laid

Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

We'll go down and eat at Joe's
French fries are from who knows when
But Madeleine, she loves them so

Madelein's my Christmas tree
She's America to me
I know that she's too good for me
That's what her mother always says

I'm waiting for Madeleine
We'll go to the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then
Madeleine, she loves that so

She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so

So, I'm waiting for Madeleine
But I'm getting soaked and wet
I've been soaked since half past ten
Madeleine is not here yet

I'm waiting for Madeleine
Joe is closed by now I'll bet
No French fries from who knows when
Madeleine is not here yet

Madeleine's my shining sea

And Madeleine, she never came

I waited for Madeleine
All I did was call her name
A thousand times since half past ten
Madeleine, she never came

Madeleine's my ''Tis of Thee'

It's true that she's too good for me

I waited for Madeleine
It's always been the same

Madeleine, she never came

She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so

So I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
In front of the picture show

Madeleine, she'll love that so

I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
We'll go down and eat a Joe's
French fries are from who knows when
But Madeleine, she loves them so

Madeleine's my Christmas tree
She's America to me

I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
We'll go to the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then

Mort Shuman,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

Mort Shuman,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam",Amsterdam,1974
Mort Shuman,"Oh I can see them now
Clutching a handkerchief
And blowing me a kiss
Discreetly asking how
How came he died so young
Or was he very old
Is the body still warm
Or is it already cold
All doors are open wide
They grope around inside
At my desk my drawers my trunk
There's nothing left to hide
Some love letters are there
And an old photograph 
They've laid my poor soul bare
And now all they do is laugh

Oh I can see them all
So formal and so stiff
Like a sergeant at arms
At a policeman's ball
And everybody's pushing
To be the first in line
Their hearts upon their sleeves
Like a ten cent valentine
The old women are there 
Too old to give a damn
They've brought along the kids
Who don't know who I am
They're thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet
What they're thinking isn't nice
For now they'll have to pay

Oh I see all of you
All of my phony friends
Who can't wait for it ends
Who can't wait till it's through
Oh I see all of you
You've been laughing all these years
Now all that you have left
Are a few crocodile tears
Ah you don't even know
That you're entering your hell
As you leave my cemetery
You think you're doing well
With that one who's at your side
You're as proud as you can be
Ah she's going to make you cry
But not the way you cried for me

Oh I can see me now
So cold and so alone
As the flowers slowly die
In my field of little bones
Oh I can see me now
I can see me at the end
Of this voyage that I'm on
Without a love without a friend
Now all this that I see 
Is not what I deserve
They really have a nerve
To say these things to me
No girls just bread and water
And your money you must save
For there'll be nothing left for us
When you're dead and in your grave",Funeral tango (Le tango funèbre) [Le Tango Funébre],1974

Mort Stevens,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts,
Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny [From Meet Me in Las Vegas],2006

Yet big for having no chance to scream
Or say good-bye

New apostles of neglect, self restraint
Whereby people die
Too far off to practice love
For thy neighbour, brother Slav
Where your cherubs dread to fly
people die

Cain's version, history for its fuel
Tends to buy
Those who die

As you watch the athletes score

Or sing your child a lullaby

Parts the killed from those who kill

Doctor gave me asprin to ease the pain, 
Soon a blood test revealed the brutal force, 
I had been inflicted with the worst...luekaemia.
Chemotherapy began the process off, 
Powerful but destructive drugs infused into my blood.
The only way out, but hideous pain, 
Cry out to God in the night. 
He blesses his children with sleep. 
But little did I know that the real pain was coming.
What is known as a bone marrow transplant, 
Was my only chance they said.
Chemotherapy was just a 1% chance 
But if I could find a donor with identical stem cells,
I could have a 25-40% chance of cure, survival. 
78% of sufferers never find a donor but something
Interesting was there in my case....
God had given me my father's stem cells, 
Perfect for the transplant. 
God doesn't work by percentages. 
We trusted God with all our heart 
My dad had had skin cancer, 
Any remaining melanoma would surely have taken my life.
The immense suffering of a bone marrow transplant can
Not be put into words. 
As I lay in my living nightmare I cried out to God,
Who is always there. 
Two days had gone past the limit to produce the blood
For me to survive. 
Doctors with empty faces entered the room to share the
Devastating news. 
I needed a second transplant or I would surely die. 
We were told the second transplant usually didn't
Work, but was my only hope. 
We needed a miracle from God, we felt his power fill
The room. Peace overcame fear, as we gave up control
To the almighty. Ashtonishment, joy, and disbelief was
Felt by family, medical staff and doctors, were
Shocked with the realization that the original stem
Cells had begun to work. God performed a miracle and
The blood began it's count. Soon the graft had taken I
Was on the road home. As I was discharged we prayed
That all would work.
Weeks of pain followed as my body fought to live. The
Devastating pain was a real sick affair. I forced
Myself on walks and to eat each day, but the immense
Pain was more than I can say, was more than I can say.
As I struggled to live on and fight the sickness war
We were told by doctors that the cancer had returned.
Two weeks I was given but we had had enough. We were
Ready to hand all to God. No more treatment I annouced
To the cancer doctor. Standing there I was in God's
Hands then suddenly one day a double seizure struck me
Down. Family gathered round to see my final hours.
Countless damage had racked my body leaving me half
Dead. I couldn't walk, I couldn't see, my insides were
Badly hurt, it seemed it was the end for me. Warrior
Upon warrior around our distant globe kept the vigil
Fight of prayer of power that can't be stopped and as
The folks cried out to God, He heard them and I live
To stand for him. A lot more special days. God has
Given me peace and comfort all along. As I have cried
Out to HIs grace the joy is overwhelming. He has the
Power to heal, He has the power to save, as we trust
In his mercy we know that we are safe. I KNOW THAT I
AM HEALED!!!!!!!!",Triumph of Mercy,1998

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

'Cause there ain't a chance for a cutout
You've got to stay with me till the day I die",Tin Roof Blues,1996
Morty Corb,"Homesick tired All alone in a big city 
Why should ev'rybody pity me,
Nighttime's falling, folks are a singin',

How I'd love to be in mammy's arms

",When It's Sleepy Time Down South,1996
Morty Corb,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,2006
Morty Stevens,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate On You,2012
Morty Stevens,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
Can't take that away
Can't take that away from me",They Can't Take That Away From Me,2012
Morty Stevens,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall In Love,2012
Morty Stevens & His Orchestra,"Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your beat; she's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
So be firm and be fair, be sure, beware

Welcome to Soundview projects
Bronx, New York, 10473

Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman
Loose Mamis fucking, they definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the Corner's younger

I smell, feel, touch and taste they hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggaz wanna be pistol Pete without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death
Don't let my boy live to retrace my steps
Minne, stay safe, move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with it

Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly
Sex money and boss
My ties to hear me see me
True villain
Face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey
Took shorts in the street

Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold
Get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
Son, stop over here, you looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game
Grand child hosing sims
Put the heroin in Queens

Put pops freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor
Cover the smell of the raw
Chest moves like bars scale my connects untimely
King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's
03 scene MVP and one accord
Boss makes decision, paper wins awards

See me, hear me
Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206
Roosevelt projects, wild rose water the plant

Son, you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me
I'm gonna show you some shit
I'ma show you where my niggaz stay sure on the mix
I'ma show you where the pain and the poetry is
Ghetto young's spend a lot of time alone in the crib
BET on the screen, walls and posters of big
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6

Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk
Still down to load up they clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
This how it happens, good people, bad habits
Diabetics, crack addicts, asthmatics
Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet

The bible, the Quran, or the Ten crack Commandments
Speak on it God, what's today's mathematics
The five day forecast, the Dow Jones average
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers
Life is a test and we all got the answer
The streets keep calling its hard not answer
And on my Government, my attribute, my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
I call but no [Incomprehensible] we do not fuck around

Um, what that term they call it post traumatic stress syndrome? That thing that 
Uh, soldiers will get. I think a lot of people get that. It?s like when you 
Experience somethin and uh, it affects you for a long time afterwards. I guess 
Everything works that way. Certain things have more impact than others. 
Sometimes it visits you in your dreams or when you?re quiet or just at peace or 
Trying to be at peace. A lot of soldiers get it. A lot of common people get 
It. A lot of the time common people are soldiers, that?s just the way it works 
Out.

This is a soldier?s dream

The other night I was tumbling towards an uneasy sleep
When I had discovered myself 
Atop the sweet sticky firmament of my dreams.
Daybreak came and discovered me
With my fantasies pasted to my face.

I can't look at you right now.
""Show me your eyes,"" she says.
""Later,"" he says. ""Now, now."" ""NO!""

Shame is a prison you know.
Yeah, well discretion is a fortress
You?re starin and lookin too closely.
There?s so much about me that I hide
That careful eyes will recognize.
If you look closely you?ll notice
That the pattern on this soft cloth shirt
Is made of workin men?s sweat
And prayin folk?s tears.
If you look closer you?ll notice
That this pattern resembles
Tenement row houses, project high rises,
Cell block tiers,
Discontinued stretches of elevated train tracks,
Slave ship gullies, acres of tombstones.
If you look closer, you?ll notice
That this fabric has been carefully blended
With an advanced new age polymer (oh man, that?s nice)
To make the fabric lightweight
Weatherproof, and durable.
All this to give some sort of posture and dignity
To a broken body that is a host for scars.
I am the new landmark. I am the museum of injury.
Soldiers visit me and admire me quietly,
Whispering amongst themselves. You're no soldier.
Your soft bright eyes never have to
Survey the battlefield,
Much less its collected relics of which, I am one.
So, my flesh bullet-ridden remains hidden
Underneath these soft fabrics
Which I carefully select
That stand in for how I used to feel,
For how I remember feeling, 
For how I dream about feeling,
For how I feel about you.
And now your curious fingers want to search
Beyond this tender armor.
I can't look at you right now

(This is my rifle there are many like it but this one is mine) 2x

Your eyes are too careful,
Collecting it all arranging it all;
Surgically, robotically, exactly.
I can't look at you right now
But that doesn't matter because
You can look at me and the longer that
I don?t return your gaze,
The harder that your gaze
Starts to run across my back
Like a nervous policeman?s hands:
Brisk, intent, anxious for discovery.
If discretion is a fortress
Then you're threatening to destroy it
By simply standing at the gates
And refusing to leave.
I can't look at you right now,
But you can look at me. Do you see me?",A Soldier's Dream,1997

From all borders, doorways and gates
Resurrection draws near, mankind awaits
When you're livin' in this world you got to survive
Shaitan is lookin' on alert, attackin' from all sides
Witness before all eyes, the evidence of unseen
The power past the comprehension that controls all things
The battle fought by good and evil is a real contest
It is the outcome of the struggle that we play context
To all sets sections cruddy clicks crews and clans
Gilgreens to Badlands, jump up, to understand
I'm just a man, not the universal architect
We tread the face of this heavenly place, and show respect
Tokyo, raise your hands, where you at
Osaka, raise your hands, where you at

DJ Krush Mos Def on the touch, we let it fly
I send my, salaam to my, entire squad
Meiso hard, wherever you are, stay on your job
Strugglin' hard, to overcome the perils of life
We writin' rhymes on enemy lines to shine light
Stay in meditation to keep the head right
Spreadin' wings like heavenly things, we take flight
Flight flight flight flight flight flight flight, ha ha

Everything gon' be alright
Everything gon' be alright

Somethin' so I had to stop and listen
It's time for ever tickin', my gift for-ever thinkin
I'm tryin to get mine cause Son it's here for the gettin
Allah's provision, will help us in the providential
My pad and pencil, will transcribe the elemental
The raw essential, the South bound residential
The pure and simple, to resonate in your mental
I flash a dimple, my Shine like precious metal
Left the rah rah livin alone, about to settle
Fast act tryin to go slow down, and save your petrol
Cause the beat don't stop, like yellow cabs in the metro
Rejoice your verse to Earth, as the verbs connects
This is a daily operation like birth to death
And I burst the breath, yep, as a so-called vet
I've orchestrated designs while they slept, quiet as kept
Everything that you heard in advance is just a glance
Of the landscape, furnish we Crops And props till
Sunsets and Tree-dots, back jobs Of pure skill
At night, I do right, to excite, what truth reveal
Got to believe, that the Most High I see
Every degree, of this three-see-ix-to-e
We maintain Son and carry on officially
From troubled projects to the shores of Tripoli
I speak prolifically, I write reciprocally
Transmit upliftedly, it sounds terrific G
Allah has gifted me, with great ability
To speak to my beloved, and make em all love it
Refined rugged, a product of the ghetto public

Allah is the King of the world, we just subjects 
Allah is the King of the world, we just subjects 
Allah is the King, Allah is the King and you know

Everything's gon' be alight
Everything's gon be alight
And you got to believe

Mos Def,"Against the canvas of the night
Appears a curious celestial phenomena
Called Black Star, but what is it?

Black people unite and let's all get down
We got to have what?  We got to have that love

What is the Black Star?
Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car?
Is it shining from very far, to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant
Fresher than an infant

Black, my family thick, like they're striped molasses
Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air

Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship that later brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin cross hairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
Cause this life is warfare, warfare

Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who, on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like ""la cocina""
Make without imagine happen but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rockin tracks like John Coltrane love Naema

Like the student love the teacher
Like the prophet love Khadeja
Like I love my baby features
Like the creator love all creatures

Who acknowledge truth and peace seekers
We on point like heat seekers
Targeting the black marketing strategists
Run up on em with the heaters
Everybody following with no leaders
Feeling like we killing ourselves
Because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay Black and God

Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like feh-lah man cry
Some man wan ask ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I., V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic""
Work to respect the angelic, climb the mountaintop
And tell it til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat but you nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly

You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star, who we?  (And we)
Be shining and shining, when we rhyming and rhyming
We be shining and shining, when we rhyming and rhyming

Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third eye vision, five side dimension
The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight
It's the third eye vision, five side dimension

You know the light
Go from the dark
The other way is ass-backwards
It's absurd
Make you want to crow like a blackbird
That's right
You living from your first day to your last night
Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes
When you froze in
The black light
Dead that
Before you get your head wrapped
Like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealing with that black magic
Try to civilize you
Not walk on by you
Like civil-(lies do get you black listed) it'll
Be unlucky for you like a black cat
A panther
Revolution is the answer
That's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer
True indeed

Now black people unite, and let's all get down
Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two

Mos Def,"Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore Adidas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people was behaving like hip-hop was good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By a little Sha-tan and this is what he said
""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash
Jacking old beats and making the dash""
They jacked the beats, money came with ease
But son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder
Set some R&B over the track for ""Deep Cover"" (187!)
The kid got wild, started acting erratic
He said ""Yo, that presidential I got to have it""
With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track
But little did he know that his joints was wack
The shiny A&R said ""Great new hit, G!""
""Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me""
The kid got amped and he starts to figure
""I'mma get dough like all of these other niggas!""
So, he's in the studio working round the clock
For pop radio, jacked the beat to 'Planet Rock'
Was out in the street when he met this sister
Who couldn't sing for shh but the mix would assist her
Hooked up the track and in excitation
He decided he'd head for the radio station
But (What?) he was running and he made a left
Was skeezing at top speed and ran into Mos Def
I slowed the young man down and I started: ""Yo money
Yo, why you selling lies to our wives and children?""
He ran upstairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door then guess who he saw? (Who?)
Jane the chickenhead radio host
Who be yapping 'bout beef between east and west coast
He said ""This one's a bullet, you got to give it run!""
The chicken said ""Thanks"" and spanked it #1
He went outside, was getting props all over
Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover
Raced up the block doing 83
Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D
He winked his eye like his star status mattered
They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter
""You rocking crazy ice and all you do is cling static
And rolling out in Brooklyn late night is problematic""
His eyes was bloody red, he hung on every word they said
They told the kid ""Back down, that player shit is dead""
Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone
But he grabbed his .45 and decide to blaze on
With shades on founded had him astounded and
Before long the young man got surrounded
Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was out chasing cream and the American dream
Trying to pretend the ends justify the means
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
It's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass
Life is more than what your hands can grasp
Good night!",Children's Story,1998

Say J. Rawls yes you're ruling hip-hop

Say Black Star come to rock it non

Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like, Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin'
Connectin' like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
Cause all my Brooklyn residents, heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn whoa
See that?  Bound to take it all kid, believe that
From where they sellin' tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli e-Kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at

Brooklyn, New York City where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity. Blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinkin' MC is short hand for Mis Conception
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walkin' the streets is like battlin', be careful with your body
You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
Third rate teacher readin' and talkin' about
""I knew he'd amount to nothin'""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type
Who'd have thought they was frontin'?""
Talkin' and loud like you in RCA, get carted away
With body parts and treys, what a way to start your day
Yo it's like

One, two, three

We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one two three
It's kind of dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

I said Manhattan keep on makin' it (Bo!), Brooklyn keep on takin' it (Bo!)
So relax we're takin' it back, Redhook where we're livin' at
Plenty cats be strugglin' not hustlin' and bubblin'
It ain't about production and, what else we discussin'?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Strivin' for perfection ever since I was a snot-nosed
Colossal, true original B-boy apostle
Standin' on the rooftop with the, Zulu gestapo

You think you the shit
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or click
Or some random kid you smoked Buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spittin' the epitome, of stupidity, livin' my life
Expressin' my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of e-Kweli-ty
People follow me and other cats they hear him flow
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano

Still sippin' wishin' well water, imported, from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the cheaters
A cypher, will complete us if we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus, Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up, thinkin' we will ease up

Really, to me

It's a Small Wonder, like Vicki, why I'm picky
These niggas suck like hickies
And still get to slip they shit in like Mickies
I'm sick of the hater-players, bring on the regulators
With the flavors like a farm team fucking with the majors
Like a river how I run through it, I do it so cold
Freezin up your bodily fluids, your style is old
You runnin your mouth, but don't really know what you be talkin about
You should retire, get that complimentary watch, be out!
Yo, with the quickness, so swift you miss this lyrical fitness
Now get this, these emcees wanna test me like litmus, bear witness
I'm like shot clocks, interstate cops, and blood clots
My point is, your flow gets stoped!
By all means, you need more practice, take that ass home
Everybody lookin at you, fish tank syndrome
In full effect, I stay catchin lyrical rep
And keep it blacker than the back of your neck
What you expect, emcees hollerin
Cause we developin the followin
Gettin played like stone love tapes and dollar vans
Order reverse your universe so your demise is first
Before your rise it gets worse
You need a night nurse like Gregory
Beggin me - stop it hurts! - is what you say to me
Like that's supposed to mean somethin?
You the one I seen frontin in the club
Your act I don't buy it, I got the dub
Come on everybody, come on just show your love

Visions occupy my synaptic space
Command and shape, to illustrate my mind's landscape
The tall grass, the low plains, the mountanous ridges
Thickets among the forests, rivers beneath the bridges
Presence of hilltops, lit up with tree tops
Eavesdrop; and hear the incline of sunshine, nine
Stones in orbit, refuse to forfeit
They all form a cipher, and they came to absorb it
I follow suit, and face it, embrace it
Shinin bright, but still I'm careful not to waste it
Destined to rise, because I'm basement adjacent
Spirit is still so just chill and be patient
Some heads approach like I'm the one to base with
Clowns about to scream and shout but don't say shh...
I ain't your student so I ain't to be tested
I'm majestic, I represent my strength without effort
My, method is unorthodox, but of course it rocks
My serious synopsis will drop kick, my topics
Run the gauntlets and galvanize the audience
I must represent, I don't come off with no corniness
It's all luminary, despite commentary
Some people say, Mos how you get so?
My sign will make you jump around like calypso
And, murmur to yourself like a schizo
There ain't no bottom on the ???

Come on
Here we go, Blackstar, hop on the Blackstar line
We bout to take y'all home
YaknowwhatImean? Here we go

We got all markets on lock
From meat to stock
Black Star, what? Throwin like Kid Rock in bars
Men flock to where we are, cause its the place to be
I grab my paint, jump on stage and deface emcees
We sell our souls like Spawn and come for the throne I sit upon
Freestyle or written songs, shit we can get it on!
Going back and forth, forth and back, all across the track
Passin the mic's like quarterbacks
Of course its phat, get off of that!
Reverse psychology got em scared to say when shit is whack
Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that!
We ain't havin that reachin past the star status that you grabbin at
My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat
So floss, cause what it costs ain't worth it to me
Cause I'm the one these Spice Girl emcees Wannabe
But they can't, ain't no points for effort, so why bother?
Cause your girl calls my name out like Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter!
(I be strokin, that's what I be doin)
Aiyyo, as we rock harder
And always drop the bona-fide head nodders
Aiyyo, later for the hater-players

Blackstar keeps shining",Hater Players,1998
Mos Def,"So many emcees focusin on black people extermination
We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination
It's hot, we be blowin the spots, with conversations
Come on let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation

We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia TRUE
Singin is swingin and writin is fightin, but what
They writin got us clashin like titans it's not excitin
No question, bein a black man is demandin
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

Yes yes come on, yes yes
Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
With that you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin, it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo they askin me how old, we livin the same age
I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That life without knowledge is, death in disguise?
That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this
Hip-hop shit and keep it movin, shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums original instruments
In the flesh presently presentin my representation

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

The most important time in history is, NOW, the present
So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin over time and you follow the Roman calendar
These people into cloning like Gattaca, you can bet
They tryin to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora
Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever
Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together
You must be History, you repeatin yourself out of the pages
You keepin yourself depleatin your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, til nothing's left
The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack
All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here
And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination
Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human
Cause and effect, effect everything you do
And that's why I got love in the face of hate
Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
The thought you had don't even contemplate
Infinite like figure eight there's no escape..

From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

RE DEFinition, turning your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggas is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity
Living to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We Die Hard like the battery done in the back of me by the mad MC
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo, no Menudo
Cause you pseudo, trying to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction you spiraling like hair locks, wipe them teardrops
Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives
Now the wives is widows soaking up pillows, weeping like willows
Still mo' blacks is dying, kids ain't living they trying
""How to Make a Slave"" by Willie Lynch is still applying
Regardless, the Mos is one of my closest partners
Rocking ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rocker before Funkmaster Flex was rocking Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosing with every breath I'm enhancing
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fag
So I run through em like, flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick, did Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, enter a millennium
Where cats will hold a gat to your back, like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, try to ? the ?
Official b-boy gentlemen won't turn off at the interim
Born inside the winter one, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioning the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon or danish rings by entammen
Rush up on adrenaline, and get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen) you got tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, SKIN possess melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin, making 'em woop
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot oppression rent who burn down your chief tepee
You see me?

Mos Def,"Escúchela la ciudad respirando

The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options, no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure, cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Yo, on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they bust strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline

I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening

Mos Def,"""Give me the fortune, keep the fame,"" said my man Louis
I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so tomorrow coming later than usual
Waiting on someone to pity us while we finding beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell
You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills
Or is it the mindstate that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal, what's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal they be reciting my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means, busting gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary

Not strong (Only aggressive)
Not free (We only licensed)
Not compassionate, only polite (Now who the nicest?)
Not good but well behaved
(Chasing after death, so we can call ourselves brave?)
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life

Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style
Be a lot going on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be loving the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America, land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually, speaking loudly
Saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walking the street, wondering who they be looking past
Looking gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this
Screaming ""brand new"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been running across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressing, there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illing that be filling up the cemetery
This life is temporary but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free, we only licensed, not live, we just exciting
Cause the captors own the masters to what we writing
Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved cause the camera survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasing after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave/Great
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memory like that y'all

A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence

My vocab expand like a rubber band
Walkin' naked through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman
Niggas just don't understand my reasons, I transcend like season
And scar these rappers like Legion
It's treason, my suspension attract attention
I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention
Did I mention my name, yo, go by the Jane Doe
Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho
You don't know, this is just half my potential
Check my credentials, come harder than sequential
It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian
They bless me on the track cuz I attack wit' the estrogen

That led to God and Satan's fallin' out
Encourage the liquor for those who ain't here that you pourin' out
On 3-way, your parents, preacher and spouse called my house
Revive or ruin, my theories of mics
Sony or Aiwa, black or white, I fit in all stereotypes
Search for a cast to plot, I make you a laughin' stock
So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks
Rain of acid drops, seek some help
Now don't rewind, get it the first time
Shouldn't have to repeat myself
Eternally verbally, I have numbers, succumb to time outs
In rhyme bouts you'll dial 9, just to get a line out
Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured
Results in more cast appearances than a hundred actors
Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils

Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations
My fascination with character assassination

We keep it hot like matches and on lock like latches
Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches
So YOU GO! To every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram)

So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered
Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars
And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken
Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans
Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams
See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean

You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus
Transformin', from rookie of the year to veteran

They braincells fryin' slowly (fire!) so slowly I flow and
Express written consent, from the undergroundin' niggaz
Coast ii coast I represent cause gettin' bent, I do
But I'm doper than sherm plus the way I put it down
Could burn the perm off big worm, so peace and pipe this greeting
Of the last action hero that be freezin' rappers dead in they tracks
Like sub zero (zero), 'cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat your flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up

For what you skied up or treed up
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like tiger woods about to tee up
So niggaz no competition with the clear mos definition
Mc's screamin' now for years can't rhyme without they mom's permission
You just a young 'un comin' out, gettin' gassed to run your mouth

Don't you know nuttin', my crew go huntin'

CD's and tapes help generate papes 
E F is the important Def

When I grab the microphone and MC 
Roll off the tongue like L M N O P 
And when I am done you will agree 
Mos Def represent most definitely 
Jesus what I used to rock it in '83 
Drank up all the cool Aid at the block party 
Used to wish I could break the Rock Steady 
Wash this be the brown shoe on TV 
But now it's not dis and it's on like THIS 
My name is Mos Def, this is good as it gets 
Baby I make you rub your lips like sardines and grits 
My what still hits even when the record skip 
Even when the record skip 
Even when the record skip 
I don't quit, I don't quit 
We 'bout to make this one a sure hit 
Sean J. make the party people feel it 

(Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to introduce a very 
Interesting young man that has traveled from very far 
Away to be with us tonight) 

Ha ha ha, what uh-huh 
There is such a place, that creates such a melody Brooklyn
No ladies it's a living G, it's a living G, it's a living G 
Love like this 
Recognize all area crew, whether you speak Japanese or Goony Goo Goo 
Son when I come through, other rappers boo-hoo 
'Cause they know they style's soft like baby doo-doo 
I will continue, to hit like a fifth of stolen Naya 
Puttin' jokers on ice to get the cream like Breyer 
No secret, Mos Def is the one that hunts a Mya 
I get in my stance and set the dance on fire 
Spread out my wings and I take the world higher 
Peace to the fam magnetic in the Chi 
Job-on, top Sean and my man Ahtu 
And all my other clan who reside in the Zoo 
Got a celebrated oatmeal broadcast crew 
Mos Def gon keep it naked like Um Fu-Fu (Andy!!) 
Put it here to the tape like crazy glue 
So when they bounce out of speakers they stick to you 
The way that I communicate is non-typical 
But high level like a 3-D visual 
I hold the mic extensive, exhibit level and dimension 
I radiate the space like a up-right bass 
Son I leave crews laced and escape wit no trace 
Sound official like the finish time at a horse race 
Here to put it in place, for the nine-uno-seis 
Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase 

Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific 
It's like that and you don't stop 
It goes onto the rhythm you don't stop 
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
The Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific y'all 
You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm bust it 

Baby it's in my chromosomes to rock 
Microphones sets who want to test the M-O 
Best to leave that nigga alone 
I make no bones or poems about droppin' bars 
I make the world full swing under the Mos Def yes 
I ring the alarm like tennis sore 
My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor 
And you should go and tell your clientele 
That they need to get The Message like Melle Mel 
I got the locked like a Death Row show 
And if I ain't a b-boy, Premier never used a bell (ding ding) 
So tell your boy, (what) crew to retire 
Before I make they ass catch fire like Richard Pryor 
Nondescriptive fiendin' for riches, callin' earth's bitches 
But most of y'all brothers is livin' wit your mothers 
Your Boogie Man yankin' up your covers 
Sharper than some new box cutters, on Parkay's and butters 
And Stevie Wonder's, to make you run and tell the others 
The beat lovers, and play my jam like the numbers 
Son I rock the globe like I rocked your boat 
I'm 'bout to tap it on your shoulder 'cause you got to know 

Now raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
The Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific 
Like that, and you don't stop 
It goes onto the rhythm you don't stop 
And raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
Universal Magnetic b-boy, (hooo!!) scientific

Mos Def,"Yo! We about to rock this joint, from the family And
We want ya'll all to know, that it's time

To rock rock ya'll
Freak freak ya'll
To the beat ya'll
It's unique ya'll

A-yo praise the master, make plans wit' your pastor
My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter
I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after
You only know half of the math, it don't add up
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter
Watch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter
Me and my squad build just like contractors
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures
Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters
Tear down the rafters, venereals couldn't clap us
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper

The church of scientology, feminine biology
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we
Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy
Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology
Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology
Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology
Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology
Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography
Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically
True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology

Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes or humpin'
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven
One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'
Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'
Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in

We never get concerned about who's in the league
We just stay workin' so no one will need
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggas feed
My niggas puff weed but negotiate the seed
The family is granite and you can't intercede
I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed
Poker face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
That's insignificant but this take heed

They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is
My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is
The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is
The place with the greats who originate the flavors
An all-star block with some all-star neighbors
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters
Achin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist
From B-boy laces to Detroit gators
Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this

Yo, I speak in whole beat legends
Divide it up in parts and sections
Days I was ministerin' sectors
Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election
Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents
Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense
Blew up the room in my absence
Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion
The response in action to light bulb irrations
I come from where anything can happen and usually does
You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun

Yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (move on)

Begun, brighter day, brighter day
Came away, came away and I flew away, flew away high, so high
I will fly (fly, whoa) fly away, fly away, fly away

If you can hear me ladies and gentlemen
Then I'm very happy that you came here

That was for Brooklyn
Ha ha, we get it everytime
You got me on? Ohh
Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South
All the continent, Europe, all abroad international
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
It's a lot of things goin on y'all
21st century is comin
20th century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not, mainly us
We gon' get it together right? I believe that
Listen, people be askin me all the time
""Yo Mos, what's gettin ready to happen with Hip-Hop?""
(Where do you think Hip-Hop is goin?)
I tell em, ""You know what's gonna happen with Hip-Hop?
Whatever's happening with us""
If we smoked out, Hip-Hop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin alright, Hip-Hop is gonna be doin alright
People talk about Hip-Hop like it's some giant livin in the hillside
Comin down to visit the townspeople
We are Hip-Hop
Me, you, everybody, we are Hip-Hop
So Hip-Hop is going where we going
So the next time you ask yourself where Hip-Hop is going
Ask yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?
'til you get a clear idea
So if Hip-Hop is about the people
And the Hip-Hop won't get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better? (Hmmmm)
Well, from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that, they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or cause somebody, think they sexy
But they valuable cause they been created by God
And God, makes you valuable
And whether or not you, recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin to be God, wishing that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere
And make you think they got the all-seeing eye
Eh I guess The Last Poets wasn't, too far off
When they said that certain people got a God Complex
I believe it's true
I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that
Helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the
Satellite dishes they just, wishing
They can't really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law
When they tell me to try to
Have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them
And this is what I'm saying to you check it

All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen keep a record in time

With ice on they limbs and big rims on they Ac
You goin' around town with your system bump
And your windows cracked low to profile and front
Now I like to have nice things just like you
But I'm from Brooklyn, certain shit you just don't do
Like, high postin' when you far from home
Or like, high postin' when you all alone
Now, this would seem to be clear common sense
But, cats be livin' off, sheer confidence
Like ""Fuck that, picture them tellin' me run that""
But acting invincible, just ain't sensible
It's nineteen ninety-now, and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle
5 star general, flashin' on your revenue
You takin' a ride on the Downstate medical, Like (whooooooo)
Colorful sparks, yellow and blue
A full on attack and it's happening to you
Wit' nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea
But five of them and one of you, that equals Got to me

Don't get me

Come on ya'll now, let's be real
Some jokers got a rough time keepin' it concealed
I wonder what it mean, it's probably self-esteem
They fiendin to be seen, get hemmed like Gabardines
Cats think it can't happen until the gats start clappin
They comin' down the wire spittin fire like a dragon
Cause while the goods glisten, certain eyes take position
To observe your trickin', then catch that ass slippin'
Like, come on now ock, what you expect?
Got a month's paycheck danglin' off your neck
And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin'
They clique starts creepin' like Sandinista guerrillas
You screamin' playa haters, these niggas is playa killers
Mr. Fash-ion, that style never last long
The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on
There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat
Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps
Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your passengers seat
There is universal law, whether rich or poor
Some say life's a game, to more, life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head trips
'Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless

Mos Def,"We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
And even though we may love, this place on the map
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at

I came up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name and more than one baby mother
More than one case, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy and more than one gun
Partner, all that's left to want is more
While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
Less space 'cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep 'cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop pleading number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs
For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
When they smile with your heart in they teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
Son I been plenty places in my life and time
And regardless where home is, son home is mine

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam

Some people live out in-New York City
Some people live out in-Atlanta
Some people got to live-Chicago
Some people do live-Miami
All my people at-California
And other people got to live-London
And everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you and me

When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning
Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chillin in front my building with my brother and them
Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them
Wise town and Beat Street, federal relief
Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
Telling tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out
On the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out
And it's all too common to start wildin'
I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
And it's hard to find
Block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son I been to many places in my space and time
And whatever my home is, son home is mine

We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam

We all got to have, a place where we come from

Mos Def,"You say one for the treble, two for the time
Come on y'all let's rock this!
You say one for the treble, two for the time
Come on!

Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall,
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still
Committed to page, I write rhymes
Sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature, from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister
Subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
(Ha ha ha) From the core to the perimeter black,
You know the motto
Stay fluid even in staccato
(Mos Def) Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the trunk hollow
There's the hum, young man where you from
Brooklyn number one
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still try to follow where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies
Violently, silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the king's English
But caught a rash on my lips
So now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (switch)
Move like an apparition
Float to the ground with ammunition (chi-chi-chi-POW)
Move from the gate, voice cued on your tape
Putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate
Who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping
To Be-Bopping
To Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(where ya at) I'm high, low, east, west,
All over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock
The fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop
Then the phone calls,
Chill for a minute
Let's see who else tops
Snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself ock
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock)

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
The out of court settlement
Ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits
Luxury tenements choking the skyline
It's low life getting tree-top high
Here there's a back water remedy
Bitter intent to memory
A class E felony
Facing the death penalty
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with
on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness
Remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot
The working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box
Sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops
It's all city like phase two
Hip Hop will simply amaze you
Craze you, pay you
Do whatever you say do
But black, it can't save you",Hip Hop,1999
Mos Def,"Hey, hey, hey man

High flying like the millennium Falcon, piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo, fronting on me's a no-no
Understand?  Doing this for my family
Ha ha, check it out y'all

Yo I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy, who dreamed about being a big man
On small loose leaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but now a day it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back, that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seeking the North beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs, and it goes
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man, because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano

I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When y'all want to leave y'all?  Right away

From Cakalak' (to California)
From the coldest (to the warmest)

To all the teams (that's getting cream)
From outlaw (to emcee's)

Guess who?  The illest MC in the atmosphere, yeah the Soul Controller
Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier
I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna
Never disrespect no women cause I love my momma
These cats be giving us praise but it ain't that accurate
I give it up to God, all that, love and attachment, get
Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to em clearly
Y'all don't hear me though, even when I'm coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo why you starting me? I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent, with the tears and sweat, and what I bleed
MC's imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off, you come across soft
Back in the days, niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guest list
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it, MC's in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know it's only cause I love you

Shout out from up top (to the middle)
To black bottom (sky high!)

Or hotter, than July

Beats by Su-Primo for all of my peoples, Negros and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth coming live, future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
With the probable tenth, the universe expands length
The body of my text posses extra strength
Power-lifting powerless up, out of this, towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop past all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects, prison-industry complex
Broken glass wall better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom sing
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
But you chain cats get they CHA-POW, who dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess, Michael Jackson was right, ""You Are Not Alone""

Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers

Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new ground to get cream
The white unemployment rate, is nearly more than triple for black
So front liners got they gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code, to S-S-I digits
The system break man child and women into figures
Two columns for who is, and who ain't niggas
Numbers is hardly real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret:
The million other straws underneath it, it's all mathematics

Who is the cat eating out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the high rise elevator
Other tenants who be praying they ain't the new neighbor
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want

He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show
(Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word)
Checks with O's o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the O's on his check
The po-po stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race
That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase
Say they want you successful, but that ain't the case
You living large, your skin is dark they flash a light in your face

Now, who is cat dining out on the town
Maitre'd wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat at Armani buying wears
With the tourists who be asking him, do you work here?
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga

Yo, the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks got it muffled across beneath they breathe
""I didn't say it""
But they'll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car
And even if they've never said it, lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she comes by walking past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
(Wow, Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!)
They stay on nigga patrol on american roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane go as they please
But I go over seas and I get over-seized
London Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think the dark face is smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalysis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained til damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology and no regard
Even for the big american rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me
""If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face""
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo

Now, who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the back to make sure the shit is real
Mr Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga, Nigga

You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen, molested and married his step-daughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michael's name
Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game, holding hands
Sit back and just bug, think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?
O.J. found innocent by a jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?
If white boys doing it, well, it's success
When I start doing, well, it's suspect
Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money
America's five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up
It's new, y'all living off of slave traders paper
But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though
I'm putting up the big swing for my kids yo

Hi ma",Rock N Roll,1999
Mos Def,"Relax, pump the brakes
You're speeding money
You'll smash your whole shit up (slow down)
Lights be changing fast on these streets money, slow down
(slow down) Sleeping on the wrong cats

Clear like a megaphone
Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terror dome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
Mos Def one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Super heroes!
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers
The three six original sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peal out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnheart
Stay on the low like the earth spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, your hopefully
Mush off or you get bust off like a ovary

Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
In a rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour
Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Cause they speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding,
Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding,
Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding
Relax
Slow down, you better chill money
Lights be changing fast on these streets dude
Smash your whole shit up
You better cool out money
It ain't like that out here
Look at these cats man, it's funny man
He probably just got that car
About to fuck your whole shit up
Speed laws out here money
Knight riding cats
In control like interstaters, state-ahs, state-ahs,
State-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs,
State-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs,
Stay the, fuck off the road, money!",Speed Law,1999
Mos Def,"I don't wanna write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now
I don't wanna take no time to write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now, hey

Tomorrow may never come
For you Umi
Life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you Umi
This life is not promised

I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can,
With what it is I have
I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can,
With what it is I have

Put my heart and soul into this song (yes yes)
I hope you feel me
From where I am, to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely
Tomorrow may never come
For Umi
Life is not promised
Tomorrow may never appear
You better hold this very moment very close to you (right now)
Very close to you (right now)
So close to you, So- close to you (your moment in history is right now!)
Don't be affraid, to let it shine

My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and, things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes,
Sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away [fly fly fly, like a dove]
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself [ow!]
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man
Going insane
Losing my brain
Trying to maintain
Doing my thing
Hey hey hey hey hey
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me
Where I am, to wherever you are
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war
(Black people to be free, to be free)
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but

Shine your light for the world to see

Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free

That's all that matters to me

Black people unite and let's all get down
Gotta have what,

Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic

Mos Def,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a younging, before the days of thugging
How me and Charlie Chims (hey yo what?) I'm only bugging
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sitting roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doing all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good morning Vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up)
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the Jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ""sun"" to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ""coff guawinas"" in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ""yarda trenny"" Brown's Village
Parkside tenants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playing loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly!
Raise it up!

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustling you can't relax
The crack babies trying to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stomping grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazing charm that have your wave cap floating back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave selling zovarax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on taking it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat",Brooklyn,1999
Mos Def,"People climbed into the night like space suits
People stepped into the night like moon boots
Marching like moon troops
In their zoot colored zoot suits

People climbed into the night like cool wells
Shiny bottles in their hands
Drinking their new selves
They say it's their true selves

People climbed up in the night like green trees
They were hanging from the night like green leaves
Buzzing like queen bees

People climbed into the night like space suits
People stomped inside the night
Stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping

Where are they going?
What's the rush?
Everybody's embraced but so out of touch
Hey

Night-time is when the things get heavy
You feel alone and you want somebody
Loneliness whispers desperate measures
And you're frantic all by yourself

Night-time is when the things get heavy
You feel alone and you want somebody
Loneliness whispers desperate measures
Baby don't make no fast moves
Baby don't make no fast moves, Tonight

People stomped inside the night
Let me climb into the night
Let me climb",Climb,1999
Mos Def,"I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish

My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you gotta pursue
12-11-73, my life is testament
Praise the beneficent
Element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Ayo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face (close your eyes)
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
Love

I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink

My folks said they was in love when they made me
I take the love they made me with to make rhymes and beats

Ears and eyes keep in good time with the rhythm
I shine with the rhythm, the Black Star Galactica
You're big number fatin', we ancient like the abacus
After us, I see most proceed to be trees
Sprouting leaves, givin' breeze to the we who believe

Straight back, straight back, heartbeats and hard work
I be the ""Funky Drummer"" to soften the hard Earth
(Amin) Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean
(Amin) Pray the same thing again for all my team
From Restoration to Fort Greene, and on out to Queens
Uptown To Booggiedown, yo just look around
Shook up the world like Ali in 6-3 (right)
I'm reaching a height that you said cannot be
I'm bringing a light which you said we can't see
Saw the new day comin', it look just like me
Sun bursts through the clouds, my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise your degree
The universal magnetic, you must respect it
From end to beginning: bright, true and living
Ever changing was a state of magnificent
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Building the now for the promise of the infinite

Mos Def,"In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn
What's your name love, where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like, yo I'm leaving now
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around, say word
It was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling
Oh, I'm fine
My name is Mos
I'm Sharice
I heard so much good about you it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey-love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm about to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, how you gon' leave before you dance with me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like, some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you, besides
Can I have a dance ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered honey, let's exchange numbers
Scene three: weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Issac
Like, if I don't, if I don't
Showing me that tan line and that tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ah damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Moon hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kitty club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Sit BACK, and listen, you ain't, in no position

I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless
Stereo stompin' defeatin' me is like

Son it's in my chromosomes to rock this, I got this 
Watch this! Assemble mo' raps, tap your pockets 
Knock this, stimulate nerve ends and shock wrists 
Smart art breakin apart hearts in darkness 

Down for the longest, son peep the songlist 
Radiate enormous, pure peak performance 
Vocal chords the strongest, acapella or cordless 
Hit town, draw crowds like space shuttle launches 

WHOO! How Def flow -- we gone and 
Brooklyn New York make the world moonwalk like John Glenn 
Son I'm sendin it out, for the short to long haul 
Earth sky, left right inbetween it and all why'all 

Now raise your hands in the air now everybody get with it 
The Universal, Magnetically 
B-Boy Scientific, you don't stop 
It go ON to the rhythm you don't, bust it! 

So raise your hands in the air everybody get with it

Be	-Boy Scientific, you don't stop 
You see I'm comin to the party in the be	-boy stance

Fly like a dove, that come from above

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them


[Chorus]

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Mau Maus (HOOTIE HOO!) We was born to roll!

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, aim fire

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

How black? BLAK WOMB TIL WE REACH THE BLACK HEARSE

What's black? - SHADE OF THE UNIVERSE


[Mo Black - Canibus]

Yo, yo

Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

Black monk like Thesalonius, the government got a black phobia

That's why they tap my black Nokia

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Black thugs, wrap drugs in backwoods

Smoke til they got black tongues, black lips and black lungs

Blak iz blak, wack MC's get smacked

Forced to go home and dial 1-800-I-CAN'T-RAP


[1/16th Black - MC Serch]

Aiyyo who that? Yo right there; blue eyes, and black hair

Kill 'em with a rhyme, or the bottom of my Nike Airs

So quick son pick one, you don't want me to finish

or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

Mr. 1/16th, born to kill your self esteem

Born from part devil, part cracker from Queens

Knowledge that we drop, you don't even build with

That's like me winnin a rap Grammy, givin it to Lyn(?) Smith


[Chorus]


[Jo Black]

Yo, yo

Everything black is wack and shit

Blackheads, blackmail, black cats and shit

Funerals, niggaz gotta wear black and shit

Black cars, black clothes on they backs and shit

Blackballed, if we don't kiss they ass and shit

Blacklisted see ya nigga, and you're gone that's it

White bitches, they wanna be black and shit

Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit


[Double Black]

Aiyyo all the Mau Maus gather up and let's attack

because they're tryin to fuck with our images

and I think that shit is crazy wack

And as a matter of fact, they want us niggaz

to smile and laugh - I guess they never seen a bloodbath

Brothers and sisters are dyin, babies are bein taken out

So what the fuck they want me to rap about?

About how happy I am, to be livin in the slum

where little shorties walk around totin big guns


[Chorus]


Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll


[Hard Black]

Nigga, nigga you think these rhymes?

You think they fuckin rhymes? This this this this PHILOSOPHY

This the end of redneck-ass catastrophes

Puttin a plunger in the, ass of my history!

Forty-one shots of reality for the generations to come after me!

As it be, hell hath no FURY like a black man scorned

Nigga BLAK IZ BLAK, you've officially been warned

Nigga - you've officially been warned

You hear me? You've you you've OFFICIALLY BEEN WARNED

You've been TOLD nigga, you've been fuckin OFFICIALLY been warned

This is for your dome, straight up

MAU MAU STYLE, BACK FROM THE FOREST KNAHMEAN?

You've OFFICIALLY been told how it's gon' come down

End of millineium sytle

You've officially been told how it's gon' be, knahmean?

All on my own
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own

We gonna build this bridge on our own
Original creation and let it be known
No duplication that I can condone
Constant elevation till I'm fully blown
I'm on my own now in my own world feeling free
Can't change the way I am with your insanity
I'm a stay who I be can't nobody change me
Got my soul to protect and support my family

[Chorus - in French]
All on my own
All on my own
All on my own

I'm all by myself no one can help me guy
Plus I'm the only one that know what it's about
I gotta stay calm to figure it out
It's gonna relax, stop, shout
You know you gotta breath in to breath out
I stay cool and collect of cool out
I can't end on my own or go out that way
So why I gotta listen to what people got to say
I stay I stay

All on my own
All on my own

Yo I know self own self
To control self
Avoid or destroy
Whatever did to po' self
When brother's right Muslim right and compose self
Stay on the grind to protect feet and clothe self
Stay true to self do for self do improve the self
To elevate the next man we need-could use some help
For long time I got a plan to see the root to self
So when the strong wind come it don't remove the self
We born alone and die alone but we don't strive alone
B.E.P 'n M.O.S blaze the trail and we ride it

Hotter than the summer at Kajasa
Where Francis Coppola and Dennis Hopper burned down the Don Store Opera
Hijack ya sponsor
Some surrender greens, yet we remain unconquered
The Black Star galactical, contemporary, classical, magical
Mr. Tim's other hand slappin' you
Tread the narrow passage through the regulator habitats
Place where ain't no crackers at
Place where all the crackas at, outer city limits
Hotter than the Red Light District
Dealin' rap flows, strictly cash flow business
Stakes is high like astrophysics
Play with mine, you'll have no winnings
Let these mother scratchers know from go ginnin'
They better move slow like old women
We want the whole cake, whole milk and no skimmin'
Hand crafted flows wove in silk or linen
Word is war/wore like denim, we textile blendin'
Topper say top spinnin
Transcribe the document, prominent on all continents
Black Star congregates and dominates
Burn through your armor plates

Make the mass mob the market place

You really can't hurt us and it's ridiculous to try
So stick us with us unless you wanna die and not know why
Yo we spray you with ambition like an inner drive by
Feel the pain of my rain when I snatch the sun out your sky
Thinkin' you fly, signin' contracts with the devil, bust guys iller
We flatten your town like Godzilla
Whether guilt is a skrilla, Franks or banks, five pence or ten cents
Whatever the currency we currently intense like great sex
You make bets before you gamble your life away
On mics I break up vets like fights
Crumble up rookies like cookies
Lest y'all can deal with them bookies
Aw sooky sooky, now looky looky here
Yo you softer than pink cashmere
Just catchin' up with rhymes that I fuckin' dropped last year
I flow clear like Evian, tap on that ass like Savion
My style's way beyond the average rhyme savage
The shit that they be on, it ain't doin' no damage
If lyrical skills is food then them niggas is famished
They can't manage so their shit is poorly represented
Necessity's the mother of everything that's embedded
I came up with the style to see right through your smile
My rhyme is true and leave you kinda blue like Miles
Pick my gun up and run up on you just like the river Nile
Bringin' life to the mic like midwives deliver child
Now the stakes is high so I'm a take you there
That beef will get you all bloody cause your steaks is rare
The hard margin
Why you startin' Your life get finished
Corny cats, no experience, green like spinach
Lookin' diminished and malnourished
Me and Mos flourish
The illest shit ever dropped by American tourists
Hard margin

What if I drop the hard bargain?
We the reason why Cipher start sparkin'
Curse on your whole dance squadron
Black Star shine and never darken
? enlarging, hard margin, hard margin
So what if I rise and start sparkin'
From never foolin' lofty ass gardens
Rock your whole head, code red like margarine
Black Star shine, we never darken *echo*

Reach out and clap your hands
I be the fabulous man so, just play the fabulous fan
And, bring the breeze, bring the breeze

[Mos Def]
And from the moment that I saw ya, I knew you was trouble
But I disregarded, detour signs
And did not stop til, you was mine
I guess God was like, aight fine
Careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it in heaps
Try to give it back he be like - nah that's yours to keep
So poetic baby girl you make it hard to speak
My dream lover make it hard to sleep
.. I wrote a little song about it

In she came with the same type game
The hairdo, Prada shoes, brand new Gucci frame
Big thangs, so big you can't hardly explain
When she done crossed her legs, she make mind turn insane
Had seen her on the ave and spotted her, how I wanted her
Ass so fat she (?) fella
What you lo-lo-love, expert in the bedwork corridor
Man see a touches her, man you'll feel sorry for
Hustlers, bubblers, jugglers, sufferers
All wanna know what her name and phone number was
They're spendin up their money like, post them up and touch her up
But it don't (?) tough, X-amount of (?)
Son, bwoy, African and tough, all nice and decent
A-yeah yeah, I'm tryin to ride with a diamond like you
Lookin pretty in the club, plus she love Mos and Wu

[Ghostface Killah]
Ass wide and fat, breasts mad, hair wrapped
Wilma style, chunky, that's how I like my batch
You a rose from the hood, smoked out of 89
We headed back, you had a baby by Ron
But that's irrelevant, bygones is bygones
Calgon is Calgons, love it when you jump in Ghost thongs
Steppin out of be-be-Q's
'Member when we licked the cream out of Suzy Q's?
Spaghetti jewels, the big word on the street
You like Millie Jackson in the new Mack flick carryin heat
Or say with Oprah with a makeover, Billie Jean slash Dairy Queen
Fantasy is, can I eat you on the swing?
See it's written all over my face, Daily News
Big bold lettered, front page, Starks how it taste?

Watch out! Louisana jug wine and conk out
Throw her hands high and make her backside pop out
Watch out! If you don't have the V.I.P. lacq' out
Them big dollars they talk 'bout, just turn around and walk out
You better watch out! Exotic fabrics, speech in larynx
Think it's mid-day traffic, runnin game like the Mavericks
Makin time seem elastic when we stretch out and smash it
Then vanish like a phantom and hurt my understandin like WHAT??
