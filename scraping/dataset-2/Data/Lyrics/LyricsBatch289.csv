Garland Jeffreys,"All of the kids where I come from
Tell the same old story
They want to be in a rock 'n' roll band
Get them a piece of the glory

You can feel it in a heartbeat
You can feel it like a soul beat
You can hear it in the bass line
You can feel it in the backbeat

R.O.C.K. rock
It's sweeping across the nation
R.O.C.K. rock
It's coming from my generation
R.O.C.K. rock
It's giving me a great sensation
R.O.C.K. rock
Wanna hear it on the radio station

It rescued me from a fate
That's worse than death
Just like a destiny
It gives me new breath

You can feel it... R.O.C.K. rock...

Turn it up",R.O.C.K.,1981

How can I make this dream come true for me?

Garland Jeffreys,"Everybody, everywhere, everyone
All around the world
Calling all you people
Calling every boy and girl
You can be everything, anything
You really want to be
But you can't play the victim
Got to put an end
To this self-fulling prophecy
Give it up and kick it out
Lift yourself up and you find the answer

Can't judge another by the color
By the color of his skin
Can't live on the surface
Got to give it from the places within
Ain't no preacher gonna teach us
'Bout the meaning of love
It's up to you and me
To give what we got plenty of

Give it up and kick it out
Life yourself up just like a dancer
Give it up, pick it up
And keep it up
Lift yourself up and you find the answer

Everybody, everywhere, everyone
All around the world
Calling all you people
Calling every boy and every single girl
You can be everything, anything
You really want to be
And it's right here for you
The answer ain't no great big mystery

Give it up and kick it out
Life yourself up just like a dancer now
Give it up, pick it up
And keep it up
Lift yourself up and find the answer
",The Answer,1992
Garland Jeffreys,"Ahaha ahaha ....
Pockets of hate, rockets of love
It's never too late, the change in the color of
The color of her, the color of him
It really doesn't matter what skin you're in
Big yellow taxi cab passed me by
Stopped on the next corner to pick up a white guy
The color of you, the color of me
You can't judge a man by looking at the marque

Hail hail rock 'n' roll, comes from are 'n' be and soul
Don't leave me standing in the cold
I used to fake 'I never grow old'
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, don't leave me standing on the bleak
Don't leave me stranded on the street
I see the light, I feel the heat

Blame it on you, blame it on me
Now let's the race that won't let's get on history
Pain in my heart won't let me be
Take it from me but don't you take away my liberty
Father of coal, mother of pearl
Never too black to blush to pick up a white girl
The color of you, the color of me
You can't judge a man by looking at the marque

Hail hail rock 'n' roll, comes from are 'n' be and soul
Don't leave me standing in the cold
I used to fake 'I never grow old'
Hail hail rock 'n' roll, don't leave me standing on the bleak
Don't leave me stranded on the street

You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die.

Garmarna,"Herr Holkin 
Herr Holkin han haver lockat mig 
Villa rosor mig lova 
Att jag skulle giva honom min tro 
Med de andra de sova där leker han en afton 
 
Och haver herr Holkin lockat dig 
Så ska do mer aldrig bo hos mig 
 
Och drottningen ville sina tärnor lära 
Allt huru de skulle försvara sin ära 
 
Ack om jag hade mig en fulltrogen vän 
Som budena bar till herr Holkin ikväll 
 
Falska tärnan var så snar att svara 
Och vill ingen ann` skall jag budena bära 
 
Och när hon kom till Holkins gård 
Ute för henne herr Holkin står 
 
Liten Kerstin haver mig till dig sänt 
Hon bad ni skulle rida till henne ikväll 
 
Hon haver eder fött en dotter 
Hon är långt svartare än svartaste jord 
 
Och skänk henne dessa vinflaskor in 
Bed henne dricka all sorg you're sitt sinn 
 
Bed henne varken sörja eller kvida 
Imorgon så vill jag till henne rida 
 
Falska tärnan gångar till sjöastrand 
Där drack hon you're vinet och tömde I vann` 
 
Herr Holkin han skänkte de vann`flaskor in 
Ty aldrig så vill han till eder rida 
 
Herr Holkin han var ej långt därifrån 
Han hörde väl efter hur talet skull gå 
 
Kersti vänd dig ej bort från mig 
Jag har väl ej ämnat att svika dig 
 
Falska tärnan skall levande sättas I jord 
Som velat förråda så menlöst blod 
 
Herr Holkin 
""Herr Holkin has my favour won 
Promise me wild roses - 
To pledge my heart to him alone."" 
While the others are asleep he`s at play in the evening
 
""And if Herr Holkin has won your heart, 
From me and my home you must depart."" 
 
And the queen would all her maidens warn 
And teach them to keep their honour from harm 
 
""Oh had I a trusty friend and true 
To carry word to Herr Holkin now!"" 
 
The falsest maid was quick to speak: 
""It`s I am the messenger you seek."" 
 
And when she came to Herr Holkin`s home, 
Before her stood Holkin all alone. 
 
""I`m sent by Kerstin to you to say 
You must ride to her ere the close of day. 
 
""She has born a daughter to you today, 
And she is blacker than the blackest clay."" 
 
""Then give to her these bottles of wine 
To drink all sorrow away from her mind. 
 
""Tell her no more to grieve or sorrow, 
And I will ride to her tomorrow."" 
 
Then the wine from the bottles this false maid drank 
And filled them with water by the riverbank. 
 
""This water is a token Herr Holkin sent 
That he never will ride to you again."" 
 
Herr Holkin stood not far away 
And heard every word that this maiden did say. 
 
""O Kerstin, don`t turn away from me. 
Untrue to you I will never be.""",Herr Holkin,1999

Garneau,"I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

[Chorus:]
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

[Chorus]",Old Love,2008
Garner & Gina Pruitt,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Please don't say no to my plea

Garnet Clark & His Hot Club's 4,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,1995
Garnet Clark & His Hot Club's 4,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

But it doesn't look like me

I feel frantic, almost desperate
He acts as if he doesn't care
A smile cracks his face, a tear comes to my eye
His laughter fills the room ,words echo in my mind

Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away

Like an attic stored with memories,the contents are so rarely seen

Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away

I strive to know myself,but I'm lost within the maze

Garnet Mimms & the Enchanters,"Standing looking in the mirror
Wondering who it is I see
The face seems so familiar
But it doesn't look like me
Something is changing ,something's different
A foreign look behind my stare
I feel frantic, almost desperate
He acts as if he doesn't care
A smile cracks his face, a tear comes to my eye
His laughter fills the room ,words echo in my mind
Look away- (Don't look at me)
Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away
Fell the lock of tension closing
As I slowly turn the key
I sense joints lock into place
Like cement setting in my veins
Like an attic stored with memories,the contents are so rarely seen
Look away- (Don't look at me)
Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away
A complex creature,I labor to see through the haze
I strive to know myself,but I'm lost within the maze
It's painful learning the truth about myself
So I always look away
Through the passage lies the answers,to the questions inside me
So,tomorrow like today, I'll stare again,doing nothing",Look Away,1991

Garnet Rogers,"Every night she sleeps alone
And by her bed she puts the phone
And every morning after that
She takes the phone and puts it back

He's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

She keeps his picture tucked away
She thinks she'll have it framed one day
And maybe he'll come see it there
Hanging by her rocking chair

In a corner of her room on a Sunday afternoon
When all the world is dull and gray
She might close her eyes and sit, rocking gently for a bit
Till all the bad thoughts go away

Back when children played their games
London Bridge and Jesse James
She captured flags, she bounced the ball
And every time, she beat them all

And now she comes home to a cat in a three-room walk-up flat
And plays a game of solitaire
Well she made a fist last night, and she broke the hallway light
And the pieces scattered everywhere

You see, he's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

Garnet Rogers,"My daddy told me when I was a young girl
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago

You're gonna have to learn to let go

You got to sing like you don't need the money

You got to dance like nobody's watchin'

Now here is the one thing I keep forgettin'
When everything is falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember
There's such a thing as trying too hard

Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart

Garnet Rogers,"This shirt is old and faded
All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history
I wear it now for Sunday chores
Cleaning house and raking leaves
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

Garnet Rogers,"Who can tell when in love you'll finally fall?
Some live in vain and never love at all
But as lightning strikes or as a small insistent voice
Of we are blessed we will hear and heed the call

Give your love and never count the cost
Lose your heart and never call it lost
May your love be your shelter to the ending of your days
Love is all that is, all that ever was

May your love grow strong and always kind
May your hearts grow forever more entwined
In the brightest day or the stillness of the night
May it be each others hand you seek and find

Ever closer you have grown
Forever now may no distance come between
And in each other's loving hearts you find a home",All That Is,1999

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

But I'm willing to take whatever life brings
Cause you're the only one that seems to know me
And even if the bad times call

If I had you back I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all

I can dream about tomorrow even if it's still today
I'd wear down my knees every night even if I had no hands to pray
If my friends were dead and gone leaving me here alone

Je rêvais enfant
De vivre libre comme un gitan

Je voyais des plages
De sable noir
Où couraient des chevaux sauvages

Et je dessinais dans mes cahiers
Les sentiers secrets
Des montagnes d'Espagne

Gitan
Quand plus tard
J'apprenais mes premiers accords de guitare

Sur la route je partais sans bagages
En rêvant
D'autres paysages

Où je suivais les gens du voyage
Dans leurs caravanes
Au son des violons tziganes

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Avoir la musique dans le sang
Et pour l'amour n'avoir dans la peau
Qu'une seule femme à la fois

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Vivre ma vie comme je l'entends
Avoir la liberté pour drapeau
« Sans foi ni loi » pour credo

Gitan
Je le suis et le resterai
Le temps de mon vivant

Mes guitares sont d'Amérique
Et mes paysages
De grands espaces blancs

Où je roule seul dans ma caravane
En éternel exil
Dans la jungle des villes

Oh vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Avoir la musique dans le sang
Et pour l'amour n'avoir dans la peau
Qu'une seule femme à la fois

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Vivre ma vie comme je l'entends
Avoir la liberté pour drapeau

Me rend violent

Je l'ai suivie comme une ombre
Dans ses nuits d'entre deux mondes

Ainsi je suis né, je suis condamné

Condamné à vie, a payer le prix
Que devra payer

Au hasard d'un cruising bar
Encore une qui me séduit

Trying to find different ways to get through
Till it's time to come back
And I can't slow it down

And I'm climbing the walls
And I feel like I'm under attack
There's too many people that get in my way
And there's never a right time that I get to say

When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone
When it's just you and I that's when I'm home

That's when I'm home
There's always the question what's holding me down

Show me an answer cause I haven't found
A way to escape to get out of it all
Somewhere that I am allowed to fall
With no bones to break I can be who I am

Cause you know me better than anyone
When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone

When it's just you and I that's when I'm home

And walls not a place to be shut in
There are no doors

And no matter where I come to rest

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Lui si beau et moi si lais

Je te donnerais la lune

Tu ne voudrais pas m'aimer

Et lui sans faire un seul geste

Sans un mot sans un regard

Il a mis de la tendresse

Au fond de tes grands yeux noirs

Tu lui donneras ton corps

Tu croiras à ses serments

Tu l'aimes pour le dehors

Sans voir ce qu'il why a dedans

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Lui seigneur et moi vaurien

Il te donnera la lune

Toi qui ne demandais rien

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Aime ton beau cavalier

La satin de ta peau brune

N'est pas pour les va-nu-pieds

Ma laideur est une insulte

A ta beauté insolente

Une erreur de la nature

Qui ne me fut pas aimante

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Notre lot n'est pas le leur

Nous n'avons pas de fortune

Mais eux, ont-ils donc un coeur ?

Ils sont nés dans la dentelle

Pour faire l'amour et la guerre

Mais nous pauvres vers de terre

Notre vie est bien plus belle

Et de quel côté est Dieu

do côté des ostensoirs

Ou bien do côté de ceux

Qui le prient matin et soir

Ce Jésus que l'on adore

A t-il toujours préféré

Les Rois Mages avec leur or

A nous autres pauvres bergers

Dieu que la vie est cruelle

Pour deux coeurs qui se cherchaient

Moi si laid et toi si belle

Comment pourrais-tu m'aimer

Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler

Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Garou,"Tu sais
Pourquoi ton père doit partir
Et que malgré ce sourire
Ça m'as fait mal
Penser
Que tous ces jours à venir
Je n'te verrai pas grandir
C'est pas normal

Pourtant mon amour pour toi est plus fort
Que tout ce que je peux chanté là bas, là bas
Comment se quitter
Toujours espérer
Que loin de ton père
Tu restes fière
Je dois m'en aller
Mais je reviendrai
Quand je n'suis pas là
Ne m'en veux pas

Tu sais
Que le temps passe trop vite
Mais surtout là où j'habite avec toi
Tu sais
Que les moments où t'évites
Qu'on parle de ce qui irrite
Je les comprends

Comprends
Que chaque jour je pense à toi
Que tous les deux on doit savoir comment
Comment accepter
Qu'on doive se quitter
Mais loin de ton père
Tu dois rester fière

Je dois m'en aller
Mais je reviendrai
Quand je n'suis pas là
Tu sais pourquoi

Pourquoi courir toujours après la vie
Quand on sait si bien se nourrir d'amour
Plus fort que tout
Je t'aimerai toujours
Tu sais

Tu sais
Quand je retrouve ton sourire
L'histoire ne fait que s'écrire
Sans s’effacer
Tu sais
Tu garderas ce souvenir
Mais un jour tu vas partir

Garou,"Belle
C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour, tel
Un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
A quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame?
Quel
Est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre?
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Oh, laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Belle
Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel?
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel?

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel?
Celle
Qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie, une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô Notre-Dame!
Oh, laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Belle
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle?
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir mené jusqu'à l'autel
Quel
Est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Ô Fleur-de-Lys
Je ne suis pas homme de foi
J'irai cueillir la fleur d'amour d'Esmeralda

Les trois
J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel
Est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Oh laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Que j'aime ta verdure
Quand par l'hiver, bois et guérets
Sont dépouillés de leurs attraits
Mon beau sapin, roi des forêts
Tu gardes ta parure
Toi que Noël
Planta chez nous
Au saint-anniversaire
Joli sapin, comme ils sont doux
Et tes bonbons et tes joujoux

Garret Rapp,"Do you remember the first time that we met?
You were cold as a ghost in a basement
You wanted nothing to do with me or the world around you

You said I’m not someone you wanna waste your time on
I said you’re not someone I wanna say goodbye to

Funny feeling how it all can flip
Picking you up really picks me up
Look at how we turned a spark into a flame
Lighting you up really lights me up
And all the pills and sympathy
Won’t replace what you know you need
I know it feels like you’ve got nothing
Bet you didn’t know you were all I see

You said you’re damaged merchandise 
and I’ll pay the price, if I let you in
You can go and try to push it off all you want
But I’m never giving up
I’ll show you what you’re worth

You said I’m not someone you wanna waste your time on
I said you’re not someone I wanna say goodbye to
If you’re a fire then I wanna burn

Funny feeling how it all can flip
Picking you up really picks me up
Look at how we turned a spark into a flame
Lighting you up really lights me up
And all the pills and sympathy
Won’t replace what you know you need
I know it feels like you’ve got nothing
Bet you didn’t know you were all I see

Have I accepted that I will never trust again
When I can't even seem to trust myself?
How am I ever gonna trust again?
Why do I stay on the roads that keep leading me right back through the hell I've been?
There’s a difference between giving up
And knowing when you've had enough
Maybe I'm addicted to you because the best kinds of drugs are other people like us

I found out the best kinds of drugs are people just like us

Funny feeling how it all can flip
Picking you up really picks me up
Look at how we turned a spark into a flame
Lighting you up really lights me up
And all the pills and sympathy
Won’t replace what you think you need
I know it feels like you’ve got nothing
Bet you didn’t know you were all I see",People Like Us,2015

You are brilliant, but

You're amazing, what

Whatever I say, we'll be so safe

If my bubble pops

If my world gets rocked

I can say you could be anyone today


Are you still beautiful in los angeles

It's been so long, I can't handle it

Does it really make any difference

Cause I'm so far away

And you will never change


Between eastern time

And really predictable lines

You make a pretty good case for

That lost look on your face

Tell me are you curious

Will you be curious enough to stay awake

When you finally feel your heart break


And I'm so beautiful in los angeles

When it's been so long you can't handle it

Will it really make any difference

Cause I'm so far away

And you will never change


I never get the chance to rehearse

And I can't explain it, for what it's worth

Will I ever get the chance to be true

Alone in a room with you


Where whatever we say

We're so safe, so safe


Are you still beautiful in los angeles

It's been so long I can't handle it

Will it ever make any difference

I'm so far away

I'm so far away

Will we ever change

And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents

In packages fit for a king

Maria had nothing to bring

So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters

And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

By the light of one bright star
Two weary travelers far from Galilee
Took refuge in a stable

Where a little child was born
To bring the gift of love to you and me
When the angels told the shepherds of His birth
There came a great rejoicing on the earth

And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born

And, lo, these many years since then
That ancient star still guides us
And now again our Christmas voices ring
Blessed we are and safe at home

With loved ones here beside us
And in the still and silent night we sing
How the angels told the shepherds of His birth
And there came a great rejoicing on the earth

And they sang, glory to God in the highest
Dawning that first Christmas morn
Peace on earth and tidings of great joy

On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and cattle are feeding
Good Christians fear for sinners here
The silent word is pleading
This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud the babe the son of Mary

Garth Brooks,"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again
Mama was a looker
Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes when he was shifting gears

Just to stay between the shores

I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel

And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow

And say you're satisfied

And dare to dance that tide

In her faded flannel gown

But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same

To clear my head somehow

Out through New Mexico
Drifting down to Santa Fe

All he knows is he's got to ride

To pain and fear is no stranger

Makes that rosin burn
Got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate
He settles down inside
The tensions risin' but he can't wait 
'Till they turn that bull outside

Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again

Garth Brooks,"Drove to the church 
In my suit and tie 
But I just couldn't bring myself 
To go inside 
So I sat alone 
In my truck across the street 
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes 
By that long white limousine 
I could just imagine 
What was goin' on in there 
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass 
And those flowers in her hair 
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall 
Those bells rang loud as thunder 
As they opened up the doors 
Now I don't have to wonder anymore 
Laughin' and a cryin' 
Tossin' that bouquet 
And when you got in that limo 
I drove off the other way 
And I still don't know 
Why things happened like they did 
But I parked that old pickup 
On that lonesome river bridge 
I took your ring from my pocket 
And I held it one last time 
Watched that diamond sparkle 
I drew back and I let her fly 
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall 
Oh that old ring went under 
Lord and now it's gone for sure 
No and I don't have to wonder anymore 
Well the angels sang like thunder

And it was your light that shined

He was ten and it was 1952 
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown 
And the goin' got tough behind them ol' grey mules 

The farm grew to be a moneymaker 
And the house he lived in grew up room by room 
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin' 
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon 

His neck was red as Alabama clay 
But the city's call pulled him away 
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine 
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green 

Now the city's just a prison without fences 
His job is just a routine he can't stand 
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces 
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands 

Then one day a picture came inside a letter 
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms 
And the words she wrote would change his life forever 
So he went to raise his family on the farm 

His neck is red as Alabama clay 
Now he's goin' home this time to stay 
Where the roots run deep on the family tree 
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green

And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the  bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'  she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne",The Beaches of Cheyenne,1998
Garth Brooks,"Yesterday she thanked me
For oiling that front door
This morning when she wakes
She won't be thankful anymore

She'll never know how much I cared
Just that I couldn't stay
Shell never know the reason why
I always run away

Burning bridges
One by one
What I'm doing 
Can't be undone

And I'm always hoping someday
I'm gonna stop this running round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Last night we talked of old times
Families  and home towns
She wondered if we both agree on
Where we'd settle down

And I told her that we'd cross that bridge
Whenever it'd arrive
Now through the flames I see her standing
On the other side

Burning bridges
One by one
What I'm doing 
Can't be undone

And I'm always hoping someday
I'm gonna stop this running round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Like ashes on the water
I drift away in sorrow
Knowing that the day my lessons finally learned
I'll be standing at a river
Staring out across tomorrow 
And the bridge I need to get there
Will be a bridge that I have burned

Burning bridges
One by one
What I'm doing 
Can't be undone

And I'm always hoping someday
I'm gonna stop this running round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Garth Brooks,"I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
Callin' Baton Rouge

A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime

Garth Brooks,"One hand reaches out
And pulls a lost soul from harm
While a thousand more go unspoken for
And they say,
""What good have you done by saving just this one""
It's like whispering a prayer
In the fury of a storm

And I hear them saying,
""You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing""
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world will know
That it will not change me

This heart still believes
That love and mercy still exist
While all the hatreds rage
And so many say
""That love is all but pointless,
In madness such as this
""It's like trying to stop a fire
With the moisture from a kiss""

And I hear them saying,
""You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing""
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world will know
That it will not change me

As long long as one heart still holds on
Then hope is never really gone

And I hear them saying,
""You'll never change things
And no matter what you do
It's still the same thing""
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world we know
Never changes me

What I do is so, this world will know
That it will not change me",The Change,1998
Garth Brooks,"There's a fire burning bright 
At our house tonight 
Slow music playing 
And soft candlelight 
On her lips I keep tasting 
The warm red wine 
I'm there in her arms 
But it's all in my mind 

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder 

This old highway 
Is like a woman sometimes 
She can be your best friend 
But she's the real jealous kind 
She's the lady that leads me 
To the life I dream of 
She's the mistress that keeps me 
From the ones that I love

I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white

Garth Brooks,"He told a good story
And all us kids listened
'Bout his life on the border
And the way it was then

And we all believed
And when he would finish
We'd ask the old cowboy
To tell 'em again

You could almost hear
Those prairie winds blowing
His saddle a creakin'
Beneath his old faded jeans

You could taste the dry dust
From the trail he was ridin'
As he sat there and painted
Those west Texas scenes

And the grown-ups would tell us
You boys keep your distance
That old man's just telling you lies
But to all of us kids
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As the blue texas sky.

He told of a time
When he rode with the rangers
Down on the pecos
And he saved the day

Outnumbered by plenty
They were almost to cover
With thirty banditos
Headed their way

He looked back just in time
To see a horse stumble
The captain went down
And Bill pulled up on his reigns

Through a flurry of bullets
He rescued the captain
They rode for the sunset
Just the story remains

And the grown-ups would tell us
You boys keep your distance
That old man's just telling you lies
But to all of us kids
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As the blue texas sky.

Well I still remember
The day that it happened
We waited and we waited
But Bill never showed

The folks at the feed store
Said they hadn't seen him
So we set out for his place
Down on old grist mill road

And we cried when we found him
Lying there with his memories
The old trunk wide open
Things scattered about

He was clutching a badge
That said Texas Rangers
And an old yellow letter
Said ""Texas is Proud""

And the grown-ups that told us
You boys keep your distance
That old man's just telling you lies
Now... they're all saying
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As the blue texas sky.

Garth Brooks,"Pushin horns weren't easy like the movie said it was
And I don't recall no dance hall girls
Or hotel rooms with rugs
You worked hot and tired and nasty
Rode your pony's head too low
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep
'cause it was too damn cold
And you'd sing ""strawberry roan"" and ""little joe""

Like the time we hit the river
And the rains began to fall
And the water was risin' so damn fast
We thought it'd drown us all
We lost a lot of steers that day
And four to five good mounts
But when all the boys rode into camp
We knew that's what counts
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay and ""amazing grace"".

Or the night they broke behind us
And then took us by surprise
I whistled out to bonner, I seen the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride
And I know he done his best
But he crossed over jordan ridin' dunny to his death
And we sang ""bringing in the sheaves"" and ""the rugged cross""
So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice
He never meant to bow them legs
Or put that gravel in his voice
He's just chasin' what he really loves
And what's burnin' in his soul
Wishin' to God that he'd benn born a hundred years ago
Still singin' ""strawberry roan"" and ""little joe""

Garth Brooks,"On the eighth day God noticed a problem
For there below Him stood a cowboy alone
Stubborn and proud, reckless and loud
God knew he'd never make it on his own
So God looked out all over creation
And listened as that cowboy prayed
God took passion and thunder
Patience and wonder then He sent down
The best thing that God ever made

And only heaven above them knows why she loves him
But he must be the reason she don't fly away

Garth Brooks,"There was a bad boy in the school yard 
Waited on you every day 
Seemed like every time you turned around 
Well he was standin' in your way 

Well he broke your glasses 
The girls all laughed 
As he pushed you to the floor 
But then you stood up one day knowin' 

You couldn't stand it anymore 
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage 
You were face to face 

Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 

Your date showed up with flowers 
And you thought your dreams had come 
But with every passing hour 
You felt it come undone 

Then the night exploded and you begged him no 
But he forever changed your life 
And now he waits a judge and jury 
Thinkin' you'll break down inside 

And with a finger you can put his fists away 
And you're face to face 

Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin' 
Eye to eye finally has arrived 
But bad as it was, well little sister wasn't it better 
Dealin' with him face to face 

'Cause it'll never go away 
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced 

Drivin' by the grave yard 
On a wicked winter's eve 
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith 
Is whistlin' nervously 

Then you stop the car 
And you hold your heart 
'Cause you finally realize 
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness 

He's a'rattlin' 'round inside 
And with folded hands you truly start to pray 
And you're face to face

And his rope's pulled way too tight
He's got a lunatic smile
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He takes one last breath
And time turns inside out
Then the gate busts open
To the world he dreams about

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Stick a rope on anything 'cause he don't care
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He says it's really kind of simple
Keep your mind in the middle
While your butt spins 'round and 'round
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'
Keep liftin' and reachin'
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns

Well what he loves might kill him
But he's got no choice
He's a different breed
With a voice down deep inside
That's screamin' he was born to ride

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense
But he won't run and baby he can't hide

Haded west across the plains
The train got lost in a summer storm
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home

He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train
And she looked down and her heart was gone
The train went west but she stayed on
In Lonesome Dove

A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand
A blooming rose in a bed of sand
She loved the man who wore a star
A Texas Ranger known near and far
So they got married and they had a child
But times were touch and the West was wild
So it was no surprise the day she learned
That her Texas man would not return
To Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove

She watched her boy grow into a man
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand
He wore his star for all to see
He was a Texas lawman legacy
The one day word blew into town
It seemed the men that shot his father down
Had robbed a bank in Cherico
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico
Was Lonesome Dove

The shadows stretched across the land
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street
The men lay at the ranger's feet
But legend tells to this very day
That shots were comin' from an alleyway
Though no one knows who held the gun
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone
In Lonesome Dove

But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights

They've never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring at the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole Camp Cookie sing 

So I read up the last of my letter
And I tore off the stamp for Black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and he grinned

And he said, ""Now why do they ride for their money? Tell me, why do they ride for short pay?
They ain't a gettin' nowhere and they're losin' their share
Boy, they must have gone crazy out there
Son, they all must be crazy out there.""",Night Rider's Lament,1998
Garth Brooks,"That night will live forever
Their first time to lie together
They were finally where desire dared them to go
Both belonging to another
But longing to be lovers
Promising each other that the night will only know
Parked on some old backstreet
They laid down in the back seat
And fell into the fire down below
But they would pay for their deceiving
For a deadly web was weaving
Why they picked that spot that evening
Lord, the night will only know
Well within the innuendos
Just outside the steamy windows
The night was shattered by a woman's scream
Motionless and frightened
The grip of fate had tightened
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam
They saw a woman pleading
Stumbling, begging and retreating'
Til she became the victim of her foe
And they watched her fall in silence
To save their own alliance
But the reason for the violence
Just the night will only know
And every paper ran the story
She was stripped of all her glory
And the told exactly how the woman died
Abandoned and forsaken
Too many pills were taken
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide
Bound by their behavior
They could have been her savior
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe
But another crime was committed
And it's never been admitted
Have the guilty been acquitted

I came walking past the drivers and the locals on the union wage

One less worry on her mind
Now it's off to work and on the radio
Come's an old familiar song
And then the D.J.'s voice comes on
And say's he's back in town tonight for one last show.

God could it be it's been ten years
Since that Autumn night outside the county fair
When two strangers shared a night
And in the darkness found a light
That to this day is still alive and burning there.

They said good-bye at the break of dawn
'Cause you can't hold back the wind
If it's meant to be again
Then someday he'll find his way back to her arms.

They found themselves standing there again.

Garth Brooks,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain

She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright

Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered ""That's alright""
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace

And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I swear inside I feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder

Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion

In San Antone and Santa Fe
But tonight I saddled up
And let her down

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

She'll watch me drive around her block
Gettin' courage up to stop
To make her one more promise
That I can't keep

The way I love the rodeo
I guess I should let her go
Before I hurt her more
Than she loves me

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild
And her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday

But Lord, this one beats all
The wind ain't quit for weeks now
And the drifts are ten feet tall
I been all night drivin' heifers
Closer in to lower ground
Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'
'Bout the ones the wolves pulled down
Charlie Barton and his family
Stopped today to say goodbye
He said the bank was takin' over
The last few years were just too dry
And I promised that I'd visit
When they found a place in town
Then I spent a long time thinkin'
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down
Lord, please shine a light of hope
On those of us who fall behind
And when we stumble in the snow
Could you help us up while there's still time?
Well, I don't mean to be complainin', Lord
You've always seen me through
And I know you got your reasons
For each and every thing you do
But tonight outside my window
There's a lonesome, mournful sound
And I just can't keep from thinkin'

Garth Brooks,"On a two lane north of Casper is where this all begins
Heading back to Oklahoma for a week to visit friends
She was walking 'long the highway so I pulled off to the side
And asked her if she needed a ride

We tore up that ole blacktop 'til we found I-25
And just into Colorado she asked if she could drive
I'd never met nobody like her. I'd never laughed so much
And I grew hungry for her touch

(Chorus)
I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and theives
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name

By the time that we hit Kansas we both felt pretty beat
So we found ourselves a motel and grabbed a bite to eat
We'd rest a few short hours; soon we'd be out of there
Three days later we came up for air

(Repeat Chorus)

Now I can't forget the morning when I woke alone in bed
To a rose left on her pillow and a good-bye note that read
You cannot grow a flower if you do not have the seed
Now I've got everything I need

""Hey y'all, watch this."" Next thing I know I'm walking toward this light
When a voice from out of nowhere asked this question.
""Garth, what did you love most in your past life?""
""Well,"" I said, ""it had to be between cowgirls and horses.""
And as I wondered which one that I would settle on,
The voice said, ""May you be happy with your answer.""
I said, ""What answer?"" He said, ""Watch this."" And I was gone.

Take me, break me, make me what you need
It's safe to say we're made for one another
And you'll never fall if you just stick with me

Fit me, sit me, get me how you want me
Wrap me, strap me, slap me on your steed
Can't believe I'm out here flying with an angel
Oh this afterlife's sure looking up for me

Together hand in hand
When I stopped to write ""I love you"" in the sand
And when I looked up you were standing
Ten miles out at sea
And in a sweat
I woke up from that crazy dream
As I reached to hold you in the morning light
It was just your pillow
I clung to so tight

You never turned around

Where the same

Are bright as they can be

Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
'Cause I dreamed the world
Had all agreed to put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the papers they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the papers were all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Where life's wooly and wild
Came a Air Force brat, in a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile

And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy song

As we all sang along

And we sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you ""Good ride, cowboy, good ride""

Well gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' round
Took the whole world on, and he turned us on
To that Western underground

And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down, from town to town
Like children running through the rain

And he sang Life's a Highway

There in the darkness with the radio playing low
The secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were young and strong, we were runnin'

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worried about paying or even how much I owed

Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Don't say yes, but please don't say no

You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
I'm undecided, and your heart's been divided

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
And I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

So, let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh they need love to help them heal

I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

You know your melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue

I want you to know I believe in your song
And rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony
You helped me along, you're makin' me strong

And ruined your black tie affair

And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay

Well I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door

To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

Garth Brooks,"When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then Daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he’d stagger a little as he went out the door

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me

Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain’t afraid if you’re washed in the blood like I was
The smell of cape jasmine thru the window screen
John R and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me

When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
But I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o’clock news
When I was eighteen Lord I hit the road
But it really doesn’t matter how far I go

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me

Garth Brooks,"From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming,
Where life's wooly and wild
Came a Air Force brat, in a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile

And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy song
We were much to young, having too much fun
As we all sang along

And we sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you ""Good ride, cowboy, good ride""

(Take a ride)

Well gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' round
Took the whole world on, and he turned us on
To that Western underground

And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down, from town to town
Like children running through the rain

And he sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you ""Good ride, cowboy, good ride""

When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side

With St. Peter on the other side

Garth Brooks,"We met as soul mates
On Parris Island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho
To lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
But our bellies were tight

We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy
They gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ
With all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our door's tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong?
And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day
In the palm
Of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island

We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together",Goodnight Saigon,2013

See, the number on the match book is old and faded
She's living in L.A

Garth Brooks,"Was the captain of the team his senior year
In his eyes, on his helmet, he had no fear
Down by a six-ball on the ten
Said huddle up boys we’ve got a game to win
He snapped the ball, he looked left and right
Nobody was open so he tucked in tight
And before them boys hanging on to him
The clock ran out as he ran it in

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
And they rushed downfield
And they raised him high
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
""All-American Comeback Kid""

He was recruited by the best schools in the land
He decided he would sign with his Uncle Sam
Kissed his mama goodbye in their living room
Said, dad, don’t worry I’ll be home soon

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
And they lined the street
Just to say goodbye
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read
""Come Back, All-American Kid""

Three tours of duty and a silver star
They brought him back home with his battle scars
He stopped off the plane in his combat boots
And he saluted the red, the white and blue

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
Another hometown boy
Made it home alive
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read

And raised on the plains
Made for stampedes and Cowtown saloons

We're cowboys, cowboys forever
And we'll stand together as long as we live and breathe
We're cowboys, cowboys forever
We've always been, it's what we'll always be

Garth Brooks,"I took a short vacation
To the Gulf of Mexico
And everyday I’d see this fellow
With his tackle box and pole
And he’d fish
And he’d fish
All day long

So one day I went out walking
And when I got down to his spot
Me and him we got to talking
I said have you ever thought
About what you are going to do with your life
I said I’m about to share with you
My secret to success
So you can go make something of yourself

You can sell these fish you’re catching
You can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication
And the next thing that you know
You reinvest your money
You’ll be captain of a fleet
You’ll be sitting pretty down on Easy Street
And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?

His simple words of wisdom
Hit me right between the eyes
And it really got me thinking
About the way I live my life
'Cause I just work
And I work
All day long

So I asked myself a question
That I knew the answer to
Is success a second mortgage
On a big house with a pool
Or is it a chair
The salt in the air
Wetting the line

That advice that I tried to give him
To take him to the top
Was really nothing more than just a crock

You can sell these fish you’re catching
You can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication
And the next thing you know
You reinvest your money
You’ll be captain of the fleet
You’ll be sitting pretty down on Easy Street
And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?

So I went and bought some tackle
And a bucket full of bait
You can find me here most everyday
With my chair sitting there next to his

Run down bedroom 209
Tonight that's where I'll try to find
Some rest

Whiskey bottle on the floor
King James Bible from the drawer
Neither won but Lord they've done their best
They can't stop the thought of you
Like a freight train passing through

Feel the rumbling
Hear the roar
My heart it crumbles
Like a thousand nights before
And the driving rain of a midnight train passing through

The wheels are turning in my soul
Her memory's burning black as coal
And it's like I'm chained to a midnight train passing through
All night long
Til it's dawn
Then she's gone

Heatwaves on the rolling hills
Rise like ghosts of love that's dead
And haunt this lonesome highway of regret
Can't slow down I can't look back
Until this train runs out of track
You can't outrun that one you can't forget
It's like I'm frozen in this dream
While she's closing, gaining speed

Did I make you mad, don't you want me too?

But there’s somebody special waiting for you

So hush now baby, don't you cry

Is making sure you're always gonna be alright

For a moment wasn't I the king

At the end of the road

In those proud shoes coming on up the alley
In those proud shoes walks all over the sky
Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture pass you by

In the neon wilderness and the asphalt jungle
He carries his cross of passion
Through the wreckage and the rumble

In those proud shoes coming on up the alley
In those proud shoes walks all over the sky
Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture
Don't let the rapture pass you by

Don't let it pass you by
Oh don't let it pass you by",Soap Box Preacher,1991

Garth Rockett,"I used to be a sinner, used to have my cake and eat it
They warned me of my fate, but I was quite prepared to meet it
You'll go to Hell they smiled at me
And told me of the roaring fires
But I was happy living wild
And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

I knocked on the pearly gates
Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through
I smiled, threw my hands in the air
Laughed and got arrested
They said hey man, you're in the wrong place
Your behaviour is a disgrace
Here we pray every hour, on the hour
Read extracts from the Bible and look solemn'
What, says I, no party?
No party?
Let me out

Let me out of Heaven
I got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Let me out, I just can't stay here

Well I ran around in the state of shock and panic
This wan't what I expected
Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me
If you want to go to Hell you've really got to be bad
Okay, okay, I'll be bad
Too late
What do you mean too late
Too late
No
In the meantime

Let me out of Heaven
I've got it wrong, no I can't stay here

Going crazy in Heaven

Garth Vader,"Look at my faceâ?¦ I look like I really don't give a fuck. Now days it comes to no surprise, people steppin' up to me and fillin me with all these lies. I give a fuck about, who you know. I do my music just to let myself go because my feelings can't be seen, sometimes ill need be they are real. Trapped behind a mask, but don't ask how I feel. Now I need my deal that revealed the truth and brights. â?¦don't begin to break from hesitating what I create, collaborate what people dedicate. â?¦feelings can't be seen, redeem my self to rest in peace. At least I can release all this preasure, sometimes its hard for me to add an equal measure. Temperature rising, realizing where I was. Ready to die just because, that's what depression does.

[Chorus]
Don't mess with my head, my thoughts are my opinion. Somehow I thought I told you this in the beginning. I speak from my heart and decide we're all pretending. What kinda message do you really think your sending. Somethings I hear come off way too offending. You want to go to battle, then you just end up surrending. I'm so pissed I'm just refueling, this is what I'm thinking, and this is how I'm feeling.

Nothing in this life we live can ever be certain, I'm a muppet on a string, suppose I close the curtain. My prediction, I'm holding tight like constriction. there's too much confliction, now I'm living, fact not bitching. Now I'm wishin, for a complete mission of this life. While they smile in my face, then back-stab me with a knife. Its like two different ways, stuck up in a maze. â?¦goin though the days I need a raise. Good times, don't let it stop. Good things never last. Problems I can't solve, revolve around my past. Life is passing too short, so I support my only goal- have control of my soul before these people play my role. I take a stroll down the brick road, through the dark halls, concrete walls, death calls. I'm scared, but most of them fall. Like nothing at all is seems broken dreams are often so achieve of your belief before you leave up in a coffin.

[Chorus]

My mind is twisted, I miss it. Always filled with rage. These words that I've listed, but myself into the page. I was stuck in a cage, now I'm on the stage, ready to fuck it up I'm blowin up like a 12-guage. At a young age I was blind in my mind. Let myself behind, I can't rewind its time to find, some music and use it to keep me occupied. So many times I tried, all this time I was denied. Decide that I could ride but never would I hide. From my inside self pride I need a guide. So ride on out, and take the right route. But my feelings can't be seen that's what life is all about. So I scream, I shout, to get my point across. But it doesn't really matter, my mind is so lost. I give a fuck about, what ya think. I'm goin crazy and I think I need a shrink.

Gary & Randy Scruggs,"Sweet Sir Galahad 
came in through the window 
in the night when 
the moon was in the yard. 
He took her hand in his 
and shook the long hair 
from his neck and he told her 
she'd been working much too hard. 
It was true that ever since the day 
her crazy man had passed away 
to the land of poet's pride, 
she laughed and talked alot 
with new people on the block 
but always at evening time she cried. 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 

She moved her head 
a little down on the bed 
until it rested softly on his knee. 
And there she dropped her smile 
and there she sighed awhile, 
and told him all the sadness 
of those years that numbered three. 
Well you know I think my fate's belated 
because of all the hours I waited 
for the day when I'd no longer cry. 
I get myself to work by eight 
but oh, was I born too late, 
and do you think I'll fail 
at every single thing I try? 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 

He just put his arm around her 
and that's the way I found her 
eight months later to the day. 
The lines of a smile erased 
the tear tracks upon her face, 
a smile could linger, even stay. 
Sweet Sir Galahad went down 
with his gay bride of flowers, 
the prince of the hours 
of her lifetime. 

And here's to the dawn 
of their days, 
of their days

Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow.
Five year plans a new deal, Wrapped in golden chains.
And I wonder, Still I wonder Who'll stop the rain.

Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.
The crowd then rushed together, Tryin' to keep warm.

Tell him please I'm not feelin too well

What a beautiful ride",Life Ain't Always Beautiful,2005
Gary Allan,"Every man has to come to a crossroad somewhere along the way.
Johnny Cash came to his crossroad in a place called Nickajack Cave.

Little white pills and whiskey
Honky tonks and smoke
One night stands with his country band
Had him strung out on the ropes
Well, he cried out to Jesus
He said, ""Jesus, I think I'm too lost to save.""
He already had one foot inside the grave
As he stepped into the mouth of Nickajack Cave

Everything was darkness
Wasn't no light at all
Just the cold dank air and the pitch black dirt
And the spiders on the walls
Well, he laid down beneath a ledge
And curled up there to meet his judgment day
The shivering came upon him wave by wave
Well, he could feel the breath of death in Nickajack Cave

Then high above him shone a light
He never would forget
Then he heard a voice say, ""Johnny Cash,
I ain't through with you yet.
Get up, I ain't through with you yet.
I ain't through with you get Johnny Cash,
Get up.""

Then he crawled out from beneath that ledge
And felt a gentle breeze
Tears and dirt smeared on his face
As peaceful as could be
Well, he knelt down upon the ground
Raised his eyes up to the light and prayed
He said, ""Lord, I'll be your servant from this day.""
That's how he became ""The Man In Black"" in Nickajack Cave

That's how he became ""The Man In Black"" in Nickajack Cave

Gary Allan,"Well, I ain't too sure about this so-called trail separation
I mean it's been three whole days
And I don't know if I can take anymore
And I know I'm the constant source of your frustration
But here I am again knockin' at your door

[Chorus]
And I'm just no damn good, am I baby
I'm just no damn good, I know it's true
Cause everyday I go a little more crazy
I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you

Well, who had the bright idea to do this kind of thing anyhow?
If it was me, well, then obviously
I was off the wall
Well, I don't blame you a bit for feelin' angry now
You're right, I'm wrong, I wasn't supposed to call

[Chorus]

No good at not holdin'
No good at not seein'
No good at not showin' you 
How much I care

At not lovin' you",No Damn Good,2005
Gary Allan,"I'm out here everyday breakin' haerts along the way
I cause ears to fall and some to lose it all
This whole world would be
Better off without me
Well, I'm the saddest words you've spoken
I'm a promise broken

I'm the ballgame that you missed
I'm the calls that don't come in
I'm every poor excuse you use to cover up the truth
I tell the people that you love
That they don't matter quite enough
There's no stoppin' me once I'm in motion
I'm a promise broken

Disappointment, disillusion
Despair, confusion
I've seen it all in their eyes
Don't promise you will if you won't
Don't say you do if you don't
Its alright to say you'll try

Well, I get pushed aside when you move on with your life
But I'll stand the test of time in your heart and in your mind
You'll think about me now and then
Wonder how your life might've been
But I will leave you never knowin'
Well, I'm a promise broken
I'm a promise broken",Promise Broken,2005
Gary Allan,"I threw our rings into a box
Filled with broken memories and fools gold
And I woke up again last night in this lonely bed without you to hold
And I walked around the house pullin' pictures off the walls
Just like I've done a hundred times before
Makin sure I've got 'em all

Chorus

Makin sure I've got the hard to find
Little things that make me think about you
'Cause I'm tired if this house always breakin' me down, feelin blue
No there's nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories away

Well, yesterday I found your dress
I guess there's some things I missed in our room
But it didn't break me down the second that I found it like it used to
With red wine and tears I've been gatherin' all the years we spent together
I need to move on
'Cause I know you're gone forever

Repeat Chorus

No there's nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories away

Gary Allan,"[Chorus]
Things are tough all over
And I'm losin' badly
I wish you were still here
And I say it sadly
But if you wanna come back
Cause you need a shoulder
Things are tough all over

Guess I should count my blessings
For the life I still have
In a world of misfortune
That can happen so fast
Life size dominoes
One falls after another
Things are tough all over

Baby, if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well, I hope you're not hurtin'
On the other side of town
Cause things are tough all over

Well, baby, if you needed me
I'd of heard by now
Well I hope you're not hurtin'

Gary Allan,"I see you here night after night
All by yourself in the blue neon light
A drink in your hand, a tear on your face
A beautiful woman so out of place
I guess somebody told you goodbye
In a million years I couldnt unederstand why

[Chorus:]
What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two
What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool

Well, I ain't no saint and I ain't no king
I don't know it all, but I do know one thing
Whoever it was that made you so blue
Never deserevd a woman like you
He should be down on his bended knees
Beggin' you to forgive him please

One day he'll wake up
And realize the terrible truth
He'll see that he had it all
When he had you

Gary Allan,"Well, a gypsy lady once told me
Son, you got the kind of soul that's gotta be free
It ain't what you want, it's just what you need
Like a black bird baby, you were born with wings.

And as a crow flies, so do I
I can be gone in the blink of an eye
Next town's never to hard to find
It's never that far as a crow flies.

Well, I set it down in Tennessee and got a little juice
But I caught myself a case of them Nashville blues
I met a little girl that tried to tie me down
So I pointed it to Hollywood and put the hammer down.

And as a crow flies, so do I
I can be gone in the blink of an eye
Next town's never to hard to find
It's never that far as a crow flies.

I live on the run, I love on the prowl
I never was much on hangin' around
I never look back, I never look down
I never thought once about turnin' around.

And as a crow flies, so do I
I can be gone in the blink of an eye
Next town's never to hard to find
It's never that far as a crow flies.

Gary Allan,"I stepped out into the blue, felt the wind hit my face
Before my chute opened, I felt my heart race
I was fallin'
Nope, that's just fallin'
And off the coast of Australia I dove way down deep
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef
It was nothin'; compared to you it was nothin'

[Chorus]
I got lightning in my veins and thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin' to catch my breath
Been chasing that sensation halfway 'round the world
And lookin' back on what we had
Well, I've done it all, and I've seen it all
But I can't find a feelin' like that

Well, I've wound up in some town in Spain runnin' with the bulls
Tryin' to catch another thrill with a thousand other fools
We were runnin', aw, but that's just runnin'
When I started pushin' thirty, it started pushin' back
Well, how was I to know till now you'd be such a hard act to follow?
Nothin' seems to follow

[Chorus]

It's like flyin' down some back road at midnight 
With your eyes closed and the headlights off
Girl, I've been searchin' everywhere
Can't find that feelin' anywhere
You're all I want now, all I want

It's that lightning in my veins and thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin' to catch my breath

And lookin' back on what we had
Well, I've done it all and I've seen it all

Got your heart broke

And you swear that

And you just wanna put it behind you
But you sit and you dwel on the past

Is gonna be hell

Gary Allan,"Half of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I've made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming, until it was over
Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made with love the line

At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checking my watch doing the math in my head

Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me running down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

By now I know I ought to act like you don't love me
