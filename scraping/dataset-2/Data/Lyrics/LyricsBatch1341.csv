Boston Pops Orchestra,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good),1965
Boston Pops Orchestra,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Boston Pops Orchestra,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low

I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1965

You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

Boston Pops Orchestra,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Boston Pops Orchestra,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1971
Boston Pops Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust,1971

About the latest fads

Upon a window pane

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1989

As simple as a man could ever be

He had a clock that worked all right
It worked all right, but not exactly quite
Instead of going: ""tick, tock, tick""
The crazy clock went: ""tock, tick, tock""

Why his silly clock behaved that hickory dickory way

He owns a public curiosity

And he was happy as a king
Except for one peculiar thing

He had a clock that worked all right
It worked all right, but not exactly quite
Instead of going: ""tick, tock, tick""
The crazy clock went: ""tock, tick, tock""

The poor old man just raved and raved
Because nobody could say
Why his silly clock behaved that hickory dickory way

But now a famous man is he
He owns a public curiosity
From far and wide, the people flock 
To hear the syncopated clock

Tick-a-tock, tick-a-tock
There's a zing in the swing of that clock
Tock-a-tick, tock-a-tick
Don't you think it's a marvelous trick?

Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling
There's a zong in the bong of that ring
Ling-a-ting, ling-a-ting
Don't you think it's a wonderful thing?

The experts came to hear and see
But none of them could solve the mystery
They called Professor Einstein too
He said: ""There's nothing I can do.""

But soon the fickle human race 
Will find another freak to take its place
And one fine day the man will hock

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1995

Sharing all the joys we used to know

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory

The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard

The sweet love story that is older than the sea

There'd never be another love, another time

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

Boston Pops Orchestra,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

We forget about our cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz,
With those millionaires.

Remember the time,
When we hardly spoke at all
The date was going fine
'Till you threw my heart against the wall

You gave them up for me anyway
I only lied to them
And words can't say how much you meant to me
Just waiting for something we can't expect

Pick up the pieces
Not exactly what I had in mind
Until we dream again
Nothing will ever work out right

'cause you had better things to do

Toss out bygones with rebellion

False alarm again
Go back to thinking you were dreaming about her
Dreaming you had found cure
But you can't write down the feeling that you have not found
What it is you thought could change you makes me stronger now

I'm not a hero but at least I'm fair
When this is said and done, I need to hear

Je moet je handen niet tot vuisten maken
Je ogen hoeven niet zo hard te staan 
Ontspan die harde lijnen om je kaken
Je lichaam lief is zacht om aan te raken
Maar jij denkt enkel aan je eigen heil
Jij denkt alleen maar aan je eigen zaken 
En dat is toch beneden alle peil

Bekijk jezelf en lach, je zachte arm 
Is voor mijn hoofd gemaakt om op te rusten
Je borst als veilig kussen houdt me warm
Maar warmer zijn je lippen die me kusten
Zo wekte je één voor één mijn andere lusten
Maar jij dacht aan een ander onderwijl 
Waarmee je zonder moeite je geweten suste 
En dat is toch beneden alle peil 

Mijn liefde was de inzet voor jouw spel
Door mij liet jij je ijdelheid graag strelen
Je wilde niet, dan wilde je weer wel
Ik was verblind, ik liet maar met me spelen
Je liet je zo maar door een ander stelen 
En mijn geluk ging zo maar voor de bijl
Maar mijn verdriet kon jou niet zoveel schelen 
En dat was toch beneden alle peil

Prinsheerlijk lig je in een anders bed 
En maakt hem met je lichaam dwaas en dronken
Wat in geen enkel opzicht jou belet

En we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal
Want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land
Van Maas en Waal

Ik loop gearmd met een kater voorop
Daarachter twee konijnen met een trechter op hun kop
En dan de grote snoeshaan, die legt een glazen ei
Wanneer je 't schudt dan sneeuwt 't op de Egmondse abdij
Ik reik een meisje mijn koperen hand
Dan komen er twee Moren met hun slepen in de hand
Dan blaast er de fanfare ter ere van de schaar
Die trouwt met de vingerhoed ze houden van elkaar

En onder de purp'ren hemel in de bruine zon
Speelt nog steeds het harmonieorkest in een grote regenton
Daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos
De lange stoet de bergen in van het circus Jeroen Bosch
En we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal
Want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land

Die had ons in zijn bed en de provisiekast betrapt

Het leed is geleden, de horizon schijnt
Wanneer de doden dronken zijn en pierlala verdwijnt
Dan steken we de loftrompet en ook de dikke draak
En eten 's avonds zandgebak op 't feestje bij Klaas Vaak

Boudewijn de Groot,"Nee, ik heb nog niets begrepen van je woorden,
Heb mijn moed nog lang niet bij elkaar geraapt,
Ik weet zeker nu, dat ik jou huilen hoorde,
Je ligt naast me en je doet als of je slaapt,

En ik weet dat jij als ik je aan wil raken,
Kribbig afweert alsof ik een vreemde ben,
Ik ben bang voor jou gezicht als we ontwaken,
Ik ben bang dat ik je dan niet eens meer ken,

En ik kan jou lichaam in het donker naast me bijna zien,
Ik ken er ieder plekje van, 
Misschien zie ik je nu nooit meer en het verbaast me,
Dat ik nu zo kalm en helder denken kan, 

Ik herken zelfs jou manier van ademhalen,
In het donker van ons harde smalle bed,
En ik voel de warmte van je lichaam stralen,
Al heb je mij dan ook in de kou gezet, 

Ik weet nog goed de eerste nacht dat wij hier waren,
Was winter en je had de trein gemist, 
In mijn bed lag jij wat voor je uit te staren,
Omdat jij er nog niet al te veel van wist,

En ik wilde wel heel graag ervaren lijken maar ik wist 
Er ook niet veel meer van dan jij, 
Morgens durfden wij elkaar niet aan te kijken,
Had er spijt van en was toch wel heel erg blij,

T is weer ochtend en de zon is al gaan schijnen,
Door mijn wimpers zie ik je in de kamer staan,
In het zachte licht, dat valt door de gordijnen,
En je schaamt je nu voor mij je kleed je aan, 

Ik hoop dat ik nooit zo'n nacht meer zal beleven,
En het geeft niet of ik mijn gevoel verdruk,
Maar je hebt met bij het afscheid iets gegeven,
De herinnering aan liefde en geluk,

En ik spring uit bed en gooi de ramen open 
Mensen zwermen op het plein, de lucht is blauw, 
Ik wil zonder doel en zonder wegen lopen,
En gelukkig zijn al is het niet met jou,

Wil naar zee toe om te rijden op de golven,
Ik wil vliegen als een vogel in de lucht, 
In de wolken zijn of onder schuim bedolven,
Is voorbij en ik ben vrij en met een zucht,

Met een lach en met een traan ben ik door straten
Van de stad waar nu lente is gegaan,
En ik heb de winter achter me gelaten,
Onze liefde kan niet langer meer bestaan, 

Maar al ga ik hier vandaan toch blijf ik zingen 
Heb altijd nog een lied en gitaar
Ik blijf dromen van precies dezelfde dingen,
Zal je weerzien en we blijven bij elkaar.",Naast Jou,1966

Boudewijn de Groot,"Zo te sterven op het water met je vleugels van papier
Zomaar drijven na 't vliegen in de wolken drijf je hier
Met je kleuren die vervagen zonder zoeken zonder vragen
Eindelijk voor altijd rusten en de bloemen die je kuste
Geuren die je hebt geweten
Alles kan je nu vergeten
Op het water wieg je heen en weer
Zo te sterven op het water met je vleugels van papier

Als een vlinder die toch vliegen kan tot in de blauwe lucht
Als een vlinder altijd vrij en voor het leven op de vlucht
Wil ik sterven op het water maar dat is een zorg van later
Ik wil nu als vlinder vliegen op de bloemenblaadren wiegen
Maar zo hoog kan ik niet komen
Dus ik vlieg maar in mijn dromen
Altijd ben ik voor het leven op de vlucht
Als een vlinder die toch vliegen kan tot in de blauwe lucht

Om te leven dacht ik je zou een vlinder moeten zijn
Om te vliegen heel ver weg van alle leven alle pijn
Maar ik heb niet langer hinder van jaloersheid op een vlinder
Want zelfs vlinders moeten sterven laat ik niet mijn vreugd bederven
Ik kan zonder vliegen leven
Wat zal ik nog langer geven
Om een vlinder die verdronken is in mij
Om te leven hoef ik echt geen vlinder meer te zijn",Verdronken Vlinder,1966
Boudewijn de Groot,"Je kunt desnoods wel zonder geld
Al is dat voor je maag niet fijn
Nog erger als een vrouw je kwelt
Want dan doet ook je hart nog pijn
Ik weet het kan verschrikkelijk zijn

Liefst heb ik een vriend met wie ik alras
Langdurig zeuren kan hoe 't was
En ik heb troost in mijn verdriet
M'n makker, schenk me nog een glas
Want zonder vrienden kan ik niet

Raar is het leven toch, ik hou
Al niet zo veel van alcohol
Maar uitgerekend om een vrouw
Sla ik naar binnen tot ik vol
En snikkend van de bittere lol

Subiet in slaap val in een stoel
Daar vindt een vriend mij, ruimt mijn boel
Ik wankel, prevel vals een lied
Omdat ik me toch gelukkig voel
Want zonder vrienden kan ik niet

Bedrogen ben ik vaker wel
Ook heb ik meer een vrouw bemind
Uit ging het steeds, maar aan die hel
Denkt toch geen mens als het begint
Een man blijft toch altijd een kind

Wie droomt niet van het paradijs
Ineens wordt niemand oud en wijs
Je krijgt voor vreugde vaak verdriet
Niet over rozen gaat de reis
Maar zonder vrienden kan ik niet

Laat mij maar schuiven, want ik red
Er toch nog altijd wel iets van
Nu prince, verhoor dan dit gebed
Neem alles als het niet anders kan
Alleen mijn vrienden, laat die dan

Er blijft mij anders niets, o Heer
Rampzaliger kan toch niet meer
Terwijl u mij in tranen ziet
Zweer ik desnoods 'ik drink niet meer'

I just can't seem to get it through.
Everything's o.k. when you're around me
Way
Way down deep inside
Givin' way to feelings that surround me.
Hey
I saw you standin' there
Hopin' that you'd look my way.
A glance
A twinkle in your eye
Memories of that rainy day in London town
The way I feel I can't explain
The feeling's going on inside me about you.
Never thought I'd feel this way

On essaie de vivre avec notre temps
Mais là le temps c’est de l’argent

Pour que le bateau revienne à bâbord

On se déroule jusqu'au firmament
On embobine les étoiles
Et on s'abîme sur la toile

Au fond la fin ne nous dit rien

La force du fil de la mémoire
Est aussi forte de toi à moi
Qu'un bout de bras en désespoir
Qui toque à ta porte quand tout s'en va
Nous réfléchîmes à deux fois
Nous retrouvâmes un fil d'antan

On aimerait quand même voir la fin
De ce fil qui tire sur la mémoire
Pour que tous les morts se remémorent
L'illusion veine de nos destins
Nous écrivîmes ces derniers mots
Et nous perdîmes le fil du sens

Au fond les mots ne disent rien

On répètera en coeur après toi
Que la culture n'est pas à vendre
Que la culture est à tout le monde
Que ce qu'on lui fait est immonde

Je cours les rues, je cours toujours comme il se doit
Je cours les rendez-vous, après la tête de l'emploi
Je cours après les filles, il court il fourre le beau furet
Après l'adolescence hélas, il fallait bien que le temps passe
Je cours après tes lèvres, j'essaie de courir dans tes rêves.
Je cours au fond je cours pour rester en surface
je cours encore, je cours de peur après la fête
je cours après ton cul qui dit que rien ne se répète

Je cous et cours et sans roulettes, je cours après l'horloge
Je cours après les résultats, et résultat de la course,
Je cours toujours après ma vie, après l'avoir perdue en bourse
Je cours les grands discours, après les promesses tenues
Je cours le grand amour, après les sentiments déchus
Au bal des amoureuses, je cours les âmes heureuses
Je cours après le vide, après ma joie qui prend des rides

Je cours, je cours, je cours, je cours et ne laisse rien qui vaille
Je cours, je cours, je cours, je cours mais c'est le temps qui se taille
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

Je cours après le carnaval, après l'amour sur la banquette
Après feu le bouquet final, après le sable dans les chaussettes
Je cours après l'enfance, après ce gamin qui me quitte
Après les grandes vacances, après le sel de l'atlantique
Je cours après les connes, les ""celle-ci c'est la bonne""
Après les perles du japon, je cours après vers la Garonne
Je cours en fait les contes de fées sur le trottoir
Après les brèves de comptoir, je cours encore je rentre tard

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan

While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

Boundary Water Boys,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005
Boundless Gratitude,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Amène ta clique: on les couche tous
On arrive dans l'rap tout schuss
Lourd comme la patate à Mouss Diouf
Drive-by en pouce-pouce
Ajoute du caviar dans l'couscous
Nous on porte nos couilles sans coup d'pouce
On a l'vent en poupe quand toi tu pompes dans l'vent
Rassasie les poucaves à coups d'pompe dans l'ventre
On vend pas l'chocolat d'Genève, mais de Ouarzazate
Le rap game: dis-lui que ma zézète veut voir sa chatte

La concurrence, on la baise, la rabaisse, mec
Passe, passe le pèze, c'est tout c'qui nous apaise, mec
Pousse le volume du son qui t'agresse dans ta caisse, mec
Tu trouveras pas plus lourd, pas plus vrai, pas plus tess, mec
Encaisse le clap comme une claque sur ta fesse, mec

La gloire suce pour un kif, dans un J9 dégueulasse
Température absolue quand le quartier se glace
Ouais M.C: ton rap ne casse pas des briques
Donc laisse pas traîner ta serviette hygiénique dans les chiottes du Quick
Reste reur-ti, meurtri par les échecs
Coquards et grosses lèvres lendemain d'un jour de fête
Dans chaque tiex', c'est la hass
Jure pas sur la Mecque, tu veux m'la mettre: je te baise

Neuf-Cinq, S.O.A., Banlieue d'Paris: c'est là qu'on est
Ma ville tu la connais, par ici la monnaie
J'veux la daronne assise a la son-mai
L'khalis il doit tomber
L'raciste on va plomber
Pas d'cinéma, pas d'carte UGC
Barbare oui je sais, j'ai ma capuche baissée
J'arrive zgègue de Galsène, j'baise de la chienne
J'reste moi-même: Nourou, say my name

Un truc spécial pour mes cailles que j'étale sur mes cahiers
J'envoie des mots comme des balles en métal: vaut mieux tailler
Zes' mec de tess, nous on fait trembler ton palier
J'débarque, Vitry, Neuf-Quatre, on a l'talent pour t'braquer ou freestyler
J'suis dans un hall, gros j'suis calé
Avec l'équipe, dans une allée
Mange du bitume toute l'année
Veulent voir nos rôles ici: caner
On a choisi, on s'est cramés
Par les soucis, gros j'suis gavé
Viens pas m'check si t'as trop parlé

T'as trop parlé, bâtard?
Nique ta mère, la chatte à ta grand-mère, bâtard
On va t'niquer ta mère
On va t'jeter dans une cave dans l'Neuf-Cinq

Hé, Tonton Seth, j'ai huit mesures en or si tu m'l'autorises
J'arrive plus lourd qu'une orgie d'sumotoris

Le plus gros bolide: une R19 avec un turbo d'Boeing
Les MC encaissent mieux les pruneaux qu'Tony
Zekwé chie des rafales d'obus
Le F.C. Porto va droit au but
Ouh caralhou, teste pas les cailleras d'nos rues
Ou l'addition sera salée comme un accra d'morue

J'arrive en balle, mon excursion sera expéditive
Écoute: je ne mens pas, c'est bien pour ça qu'j'obtiens l'respect des p'tits
Toujours au top moi, j'ai la bonne recette
On prend les mêmes et on recommence
J'te mets en transe sur l'album de Seth
En une phase, le ter-ter subit un tremblement
J't'ai vu dans l'angle mort, tu kiffais pas, au final t'en redemandes
J'suis une bombe à retardement
Ça fait ""brrraaah"", ""zdedededex""
Ouvre pas tes fesses, j'te la mets tendrement

On a des têtes comme dans le ""Dernier Gang""
Oufs à la Spaggiari, on est des barbares
Que des ""7"" sur le code-barre
Ambiance Audiard ou Tarantino, touche pas à nos bambinos
On t'aura, comme dans ""Gomorra"": cache pas l'butin sous l'Dunlopillo
Demande à Al Poelvoordino: wanted pour murder
Nique ta mère la Police, nique ta race Fox Mulder
On y croit tous comme Ribéry, fout l'dawa comme au Bayern
J'baiserai la France jusqu'à c'qu'elle m'aime comme Mac Tyer

C'est pour les malfrats, les ghetto youths
Entre la mosquée et la muscul', ou sur Neptune via d'la ppe-fra Absolut
Insolents, on sait vi-sèr' des sons lourds
Prêts a salir
Coûte que coûte on veut les salaires
Coups d'couteau dans sa mère

La marijuana vient d'Tijuana
Les balles qu'on tire, wallah, viennent du Caucase
La fumée s'propage comme des phéromones
Starfoullah l'héritage qu'on a offert aux mômes
Avec classe, on s'échappe par l'vasistas
Face au fisc on balise pas
Vu qu'à la douane les valises passent
T'façon on a jamais aimé Rambo, Tarzan
Nos idoles sont ceux qui vendent des kilos d'pavot afghan

J'suis le côté diabolique de Serge Gainsbourg
J'connais le diagnostic mais j'espère que les médecins s'gourent
J'festoie fils: serre-moi un verre d'vin rouge
J'm'esquinte, j'souffre, j'suis quelqu'un d'louche
Je fatigue Satan
Crois pas qu'la Police arrive à temps
Ou qu'ça tire à blanc dans la galerie marchande
Je fabrique l'argent, la famille attend
Qu'j'ramène entre les dents le string de Fanny Ardant

Envoie les clefs du TT, j'me transforme en virtuose
J'mets des grosses fessées sur des p'tits culs roses
Vote pour moi sur ""chien-d'la-casse.fr""
J'te regarde de travers si tu cherches moi les vers
J'pue l'Jack Daniel, j'suis l'fils caché d'Gargamel
J'm'en vais danser l'disco avec deux-trois chattes d'Asnières
On s'entraîne au tir au bois d'Achères
Ambiance murder, pas d'voice au vocoder
C'est Giorgio Moroder

Sur moi, ne lé-par pas
Car chez nous la trahison ne se répare pas
On prend les sens interdits
T'rentre dedans comme la vachette d'Intervilles
Crois pas qu'chez nous c'est fantastique
À mettre la cagoule, les gants en plastique
Les 'tasses de tess', c'est pas ma tasse de thé
Pour les p'tis gars du Seize: fais des traces de C

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette
C'est la galère ouais, mais nique sa mère, on a l'feeling
Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf
Bouffe pas la galette des rois, tu trouveras pas la fève
J'ai vendu la galette darwa, j'ai fini au Quai des Orfèvres

Laissez passer les têtes de cabochards
Enfouraillés au 79, rue Quentin Bauchart
Donne toujours une pièce quand tu rencontres un clochard
Wesh, éteins ton char
Échange pas des années d'liberté contre un bon-char
En bon couche-tard, j'ai la gueule du Capitaine Caverne

Why you gwan, watch out for Babylon, MC's babble on and on I phenom,
Bomb like Ethiopians, not Italions, Queen Asheba, balance like a Libra,
Rain like meteor storms, that change forms like the pillars of Islam,
Make the best rule, and fuck the rest who'll, it takes one drop of
Purity to clean the cess pool, the next crew, will be comprised of kings
And queens wearing crowns and holiday scepters, facing Mecca, making
Records, raiding biblio-techas, I sip nectars with gods in the
Streetapparel, keep the path straight and narrow while we bombin' on
Pharaoh, so Bounty Killer pour the sorrel let's make plans for tomorrow,

Yo, five years old I heard shots out the window, I thought that it was
Zorro, driving in from Mexico, I asked my father Pablo who the hell is
This Paco, he said It's Bounty Killer, He's driving in from Montego.

That's when shots start to echo from yah so and from deh so, well that
Is the life of a nigga from the ghetto, moving 40 kilo, from here to
Puerto Rico, smoke my manifico, but I never do perico.

Yo, this is a sound clash, you ain't fit for the job, you're vagina,
And you're making my cock hard, you want to rap, here's presents, go rap
It in a box, you versus me is like a mouse versus a ox, Wyclef,
Preacher's son, I sing a hym the lights get dim, reflection of the end,
Is your face facing a coffin, oops, to abstract so you kill me with
Gaps, figments of your imagination, you never delt with incarceration.

Thought I heard you want to be my rival, askel 45 a it a idol, them
Start war end no seek survival, Refugees we gonna treat them
Detrimental, Punks, fools.

Another sound boy dies, slow deth, Refugee Camp, Bounty Killer

[Chorus]

Through the temples of doom somehow we managed to bloom like blossoms,
By any means necessary said Malcolm, nights before battle we play dead
Like possums, mimimizing our losses like caution to the maximum,
Stratiges for the Refugees, how many mics do you trip, I say not to many

Yo, which man runs from my magnum,

Haitian shot a man

Them blame Jamaicans

Yeah, yeah yeah

Well talk well if you vex, try and jump in a mi chest, you Mr. Punk,

Right now I'd rather die, cause man a live like dog. 

Look down on my shoes, can you see my toes? 
The struggle that we live nobody really knows 
Stop and ask yourself, would you live like that? 
And if you had to then, wouldn't you bus gun shot?

Three monkeys sitting under a coconut tree (really?)
Discussing things as they are said to be
Said one to the others, now listen you two

But the very idea is a big disgrace
No monkey ever deserted his wife
Or her baby, to ruin their lives

Pass out and tribes to create a character sold us shit
On earth was magical
Then the strangers came from the boat with the ropes
Chains that felt strange, they called it the slave game
The game changed
They had shackled like assholes

You know you make me a better world
You know I never knew love like this before
The way you hug me, and love me
You know I like it all over, oh

Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra,"At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day standing about, what is it for?
One day less to be living

At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the plague is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying

At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and
There's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day

At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread

There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job
And in a bed
And we're counting our blessings

Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands
And the boss, he never knows
That the foreman is always on heat
If Fantine doesn't look out
Watch how she goes
She'll be out on the street

At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
Keep on grafting till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs off the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day

And what have we here, little innocent sister?
Oh, come on Fantine, let's have all the news
Dear Fantine you must send us more money
Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose

Give that letter to me
It is none of your business
With a husband at home
And a bit on the side
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

What is this fighting all about?
Will someone tear these two apart
This is a factory, not a circus
Now, come on ladies, settle down
I am the mayor of this town
I run a business of repute

Deal with this foreman
be as patient as you can

I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret

Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night

You,
Why should you learn of war or pain?
To be sure you're not hurt again,
I swear I'd give my life for you.

I've tasted love beyond all fear.
And you should know it's love that brought you here.
And in one perfect night,
When the stars burned like new,
I knew what I must do.
I'll give you a million things I'll never own.
I'll give you a world to conquer when you're grown.

Sometimes I wake up, reaching for him.
I feel his shadow brush my head,
But there's just moonlight on my bed.

1. Je m'en allais chercher des oies
Du côté de Fouilly-les-oies

Soudain qui vois-je devant moi ?
Un' belle fille au frais minois
A bicyclette.
En arrivant à sa hauteur,
J'y fais' un sourire enchanteur
A bicyclette.
Ell' rit aussi, on parle alors
Et ell' me dit dans nos transports
A bicyclette.

Des détours des contours
Et même d'autres tours...
Des tours de quoi qu'em' dit.
Des tours d'vélo, pardi !
Vous êtes un blagueur.
Ah ! c'que vous êt's coureur !

2. Dans les champs chantaient les grillons,
Le soleil dardait ses rayons
De bicyclette.
Ell' voulait que je chante un brin,
Mais à cela j'ai mis un frein
De bicyclette.
Près d'un tournant y'avait un bois
Où l'on se dirigea, ma foi
A bicyclette.
Mais comme ell' roulait près de moi
Voilà qu'èm' dit presqu'à mi-voix

Que j'étais un coureur, coureur

Bourvil,"Chansonnier... c'est un bon métier aussi... ça rapporte... parce qu'il y a le « droit d'auteur »... Vous ne savez pas ce que c'est le droit d'auteur ?... Ben !... je vais vous l'expliquer... Je me suis renseigné auprès d'un camarade chansonnier... Pensez bien que j'aurais pas voulu m'engager dans ce métier-là sans savoir. Le droit d'auteur c'est comme de l'argent que vous touchez... plus ou moins... selon la hauteur... Si vous êtes grand chansonnier... si... euh !... enfin... c'est le droit d'auteur. Maintenant pour moi ça marche bien, je suis au théâtre des deux ânes... J'y suis rentré assez bêtement... C'est le directeur du théâtre des deux ânes qui m'a écrit qu'il y en avait un des deux qui était malade, alors si je voulais le remplacer... Pensez bien que j'ai sauté sur l'occasion. J'ai bien vu comment ils faisaient les autres chansonniers... c'est pas difficile... Quand on est chansonnier il faut faire des chansons sur ce qui se passe, alors eux... les chansonniers, qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?... Ils achètent le journal, puis ils lisent ce qu'il y a dessus, alors ils ne sont pas plus bêtes que d'autres, ils comprennent bien ce qu'ils lisent... Alors ils le mettent en vers et contre tous... Voilà... Vous n'avez peut-être pas bien compris ?... Je vais vous donner un exemple... Par exemple, sur le journal, vous voyez : « Aujourd'hui on ne touche pas de viande »... Ben... c'est le titre de votre chanson !... Mais si l'on en touche, faut changer... C'est vrai qu'en ce moment on est tranquille... on est parfois trois semaines sans changer. Puis il faut mettre ça sur un air, un air de danse... n'importe quoi... la danse devant le buffet par exemple... ou autre chose... un air vache... ou un air bœuf, ça corse un peu. Ecoutez la mienne... C'est sur un sujet original... c'est sur le ravitaillement.

Avec mes tickets d'viande mon boucher l'autre soir, 
Voulait m'donner du mou, mais j'ai laissé l' mou... choir 
Mouchoir... Hein!...  Il est bon...  Ça porte (rires), puis aux deux
ânes mes camarades chansonniers sont gentils avec moi, quand je fais
un jeu de mots, pour créer l'ambiance ils font  : hi ! han ! hi ! han !…
parce qu'ils me disent que c'est moi  le plus qualifié pour représenter les deux ânes.
Le franc est dévalué, il vaut un sou maintenant 
A ce prix-là  le franc n'est vraiment  qu'un sous franc 
Souffrant... Hein !... Il est bien aussi celui-là...  Il porte... surtout à l'étranger...

Maintenant, le troisième  :
Y a des engins nouveaux qui font sensation... on 
(Là il me manquait un pied...  alors j'ai ajouté on... Je vais vous expliquer après...)
Mais  aux  bomb's atomiques je préfère les bomb'... on...
Bonbons... Hein... Il est peut-être plus difficile à comprendre mais il est bien aussi... celui-là.

Quatrième :
Pour faire la soupe, mettez un verre de lunettes 
Dans un livre de messe... ça f'ra un verr' missel...
Vermicelle... Hein !... (rires) il est bien aussi celui-là... L'autre jour il y a un spectateur qui m'avait tellement compris qu'il m'a jeté un poireau sur la scène en me disant : « Tiens !… tu mettras ça dans ta soupe !... ça corsera...

Cinquième   :
Si vous applaudissez brav' gens ma p'tite chanson

Bourvil,"Moi quand j'étais jeune je ne voulais pas être artiste lyrique... Non, je voulais être ingénieur des ponts, puis des chaussées ; alors mes parents m'ont mis à l'école ; j'y suis réglé longtemps, j'y suis resté jusqu'à dix-neuf ans et demi, parce que j'avais du mal à avoir mon certificat d'études, alors j'y suis resté jusqu'à cet âge-là pour l'avoir. Mais vous savez, à l'école, on n'étudiait pas tout pour être ingénieur dans les ponts puis dans les chaussées ! Non ! Moi j'étudiais ça parce que j'avais ça dans le sang... le génie, l'initiative... Mais il y en avait d'autres qui étudiaient l'anglais parce qu'ils voulaient aller en Angleterre, d'autres qui étudiaient l'algèbre parce qu'ils voulaient aller à Alger... Je ne sais pas si vous avez été dans les grandes écoles, mais c'est comme ça que ça se passe !

Puis vous savez, quand on a terminé ses études en tant qu'ingénieur des ponts puis des chaussées, en sortant on a une place tout de suite... Alors moi, en sortant, j'ai débuté comme chef cantonnier. Alors là j'avais l'initiative, on m'avait confié le commandement ; j'avais quatre cantonniers sous mes ordres. J'avais les plans, je calculais, parce que vous savez, dans les routes... tant de trous... tant de cailloux... tant de brouettes... n'est-ce pas... les multiplications, puis les divisions... Enfin, j'avais les études pour ça, c'était normal. Et tout le monde me connaissait bien là-bas, même les gosses... De loin, ils me criaient : «L'ingénieur!... L’ingénieur !... » Ils savaient bien que j'étais ingénieur!... Après ça, le moment d'aller au régiment est venu ; alors je me suis dit : en tant qu'ingénieur, ils vont me repérer... Ça n'a pas manqué, ils m'ont mis dans le génie... Mais là j'étais chez moi... avec tous les ingénieurs ! Ils m'appelaient « l'ingénieur d'ailleurs »!... Ils m'appelaient même « l'homme lumière»... pour rigoler... parce que j'avais été versé dans une section motocycliste comme éclaireur. Dans les manœuvres, je partais de l’avant et j'éclairais avec ma moto, je faisais de la lumière. Un jour j'ai eu un ennui parce que ma moto était en panne ; j'étais embarrassé parce que moi j'ai fait mes études dans les ponts puis dans les chaussées, mais dans le moteur... non.... mais quand même je n'ai pas voulu en rester là... Dans le génie on est tous comme ça, on veut toujours voir plus loin... découvrir... J'en ai pas eu pour longtemps... J'ai l'habitude de chercher... J'ai vu un truc qui giclait... le gicleur... Ensuite la bougie, j'ai fait faire l'étincelle... En moins de deux ça y était... j'avais foutu le feu à la moto. J'étais embarrassé parce que j'avais de l'essence sur ma capote, alors j'ai pris feu. Ça me chauffait... ça me chauffait... Mais quand même j'ai pas perdu mon sang-froid... Toujours l'initiative ! Il y avait un herbage à côté, je me suis roulé dans l'herbe pour tout étouffer... toujours l'initiative !... Mais je n'avais pas fait attention que dans l'herbage il y avait beaucoup de vaches, alors naturellement il y avait beaucoup de... puis forcément je me suis roulé dedans... et plus je me roulais... plus j'en écrasais !... Surtout moi qui suis lourd... J'avais bien appris à l'école : pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse, mais je vous garantis que si Pierre... il en n'a pas ramassé de la mousse... moi j'en ai ramassé... J'étais plutôt emmoussaillé... Puis pour mes brûlures c'était pas bon... Je savais bien que l'on mettait de la pommade, mais tout de même pas celle-là. Mais quand même je n'ai pas perdu le nord... toujours l'initiative !... Il y avait une mare à côté ; je me suis dit, je vais plonger, ça va tout éteindre... Aussitôt dit, aussitôt fait, je plonge jusqu'au fond... Ça n'a pas loupé !... Surtout que je ne sais pas nager, alors j'ai eu plus de facilité. J'étais au fond, je ne pouvais plus remonter, alors les copains m'ont repêché ; je me suis retrouvé à l'hôpital. Le docteur est venu et m'a dit : « Alors ! Sacré ingénieur ! (parce qu'il savait bien que j'étais ingénieur), Tu t'es noyé, tu t'es brûlé... tu t'es jeté dans l'eau bouillante ? » Je lui dis : « Non, docteur ! Je brûlais, alors, vous comprenez j'ai plongé !... » Alors il me dit : « Tu as dû être transi ! » Je lui dis : « Non, docteur, j'étais bien couvert !...»",L' Ingénieur,2001

Bourvil,"Le métier que j' préfère, c'est inventeur !... Oui!... Parce qu'inventeur c'est un métier où il faut déployer beaucoup d'intelligence et d'initiative. Alors y' m' semble que là-dessus j'ai pas à m' plaindre... j' suis bien servi !... hein !... On m'avait dit : « Si tu arrives à inventer quelque chose, tu n'auras qu'à en parler à un financier, il t'achètera ton invention, ça te rapportera beaucoup. » Alors j'ai décidé d'y aller. En arrivant, la secrétaire m'a dit : « Justement on vous attendait ! » J' m' dis comme ça : « Ça tombe bien ». Elle m'a dit : « Rentrez, on va vous introduire tout de suite ! » Alors j' la Vois revenir avec un grand balai ; j'commençais à avoir peur et j' lui dis : « Je ne suis pas le balayeur, excusez-moi ! » Elle me répond : « Y a pas de mal ! » J' lui dis : « Si, y a une valise, c'est là-dedans que j' mets mon invention ! » Elle m' dit : « Vous êtes inventeur ?... » J' lui dis : « Oui ». Elle m' dit : « L'habit fait pas le moine ». J' lui dis : « Oui »... J'étais un peu troublé. Elle m' dit : « On va vous faire attendre un peu ». J' lui dis : « Oui, mais pas trop, longtemps !... » Alors j'attends trois heures !... Je m' disais comme ça, si ça continue ça va pas tarder à être long. J' m'étais assis sur ma valise en attendant parce que j'avais peur qu'on me vole mon invention, si toutefois j' m'étais endormi. Puis pendant tout le temps que j'attendais il y avait les dactylos ; elles entr'ouvraient la porte les unes après les autres pour me r'garder... puis elles riaient ! Elles étaient jeunes, fallait bien qu'elles s'amusent !... Ou alors peut-être bien qu'elles rigolaient parce que j'étais sympathique... Peut-être !... Ou alors elles me regardaient pour m'épier parce qu'elles avaient peur que j' m'en aille avec mon invention. A un moment j'ai même abusé, je leur ai fait peur, je leur ai dit : « Si vous me faites attendre encore... trois ou quatre heures, j' vais m'en aller avec mon invention... » Alors là elles ont eu peur. Le soir même j'étais reçu par le directeur. J' lui dis : « Bonjour... » J' lui dis : « J' suis l'inventeur ! » Il m' répond : « J' suis sceptique ! » J' lui réponds : « Enchanté ! » Y m' dit : « Vous savez que pour être inventeur il faut avoir un certain bagage !... » J' lui réponds pas, mais sans avoir l'air de rien j' lui fais voir ma valise. Alors là il a été suffoqué, il en a même fait une réflexion à sa secrétaire ; il lui a dit : « Qu'est-ce qui traîne... » I m'a dit : « Vous avez une certaine ressemblance avec celui qui a inventé le fil à couper le beurre !... » J' lui dis : « Ça s' peut très bien, y a eu tellement d'inventeurs dans ma famille. » Alors j' lui ai présenté mon invention, je lui ai dit : « Voilà, j'ai inventé quelque chose pour attraper les crocodiles vivants !... » Alors, tout d' suite intéressé dans l'affaire, y m' répond : « Ah !... très bien !... » Je lui dis : « Voilà : il faut une valise pour mettre l'invention, puis pour rapporter le crocodile ; une paire de jumelles, des journaux (parce que quand vous avez rendez-vous avec un crocodile, si toutefois il vous fait attendre, vous lisez l'journal), puis une pince à épiler ; alors vous allez dans un endroit où y a des crocodiles, autant que possible (sans quoi vous êtes obligé d'emporter un stock de journaux), puis vous attendez, et quand vous voyez le crocodile s'amener, faut pas avoir peur... Tout simplement vous prenez votre jumelle... mais... mais... vous la prenez par le gros bout... du sens opposé... Alors, forcément.. l' crocodile !... vous 1' voyez tout p'tit !... Il est fait comme un rat... Enfin, comme un crocodile, mais il est tout p'tit ; alors vous prenez votre pince à épiler, puis vous l' mettez dans le panier !... Voilà !... »",L' Inventeur,2004
Bourvil,"Je vais vous chanter une rumba et je vais vous la danser ; parce que je n'ai pas l'air comme ça, moi, je suis souple vous savez. Quand je suis déshabillé, tout ça (montrant ses pectoraux) c'est plein !... C'est dodu !... On voit le muscle. D'ailleurs moi... avant je faisais des poses plastiques, j'ai pris trois ans de leçon avec Serge Nifar. Vous le connaissez Serge Nifar ? Hein !... Bon ! Quand vous le verrez, vous lui demanderez : « Est-ce que vous connaissez le danseur Bourvil ? » Ben, il vous dira « Oui ! » Vous voyez bien que je ne vous mens pas !.... C'est une preuve ça !... Puis avec, Serge Nifar vous voyez les poses plastiques ! Vous regardez, hein ?... (Faire quelques poses comiques.) Des poses plastiques, j'en connais beaucoup !... Pensez, j'en faisais mon métier ! Alors ! Puis Serge Nifar, c'est un type qui voyait clair ! Il avait bien vu que j'avais des facilités, alors il m'avait dit : « On vous poussera un peu et vous me remplacerez à l'Opéra ! » Alors je l'ai doublé à l'Opéra pendant trois ans, mais je n'ai pas eu de chance parce qu'il n'a jamais été malade ! Alors !... Sans ça, je l'aurais fait, vous savez !... D'ailleurs Serge Nifar me l'avait dit ; il m'avait dit : « Votre souplesse vous le permettrait ». Alors !... Pensez bien si j'étais content, moi. Après ça j'ai eu un contrat au Grand Casino de Paris, mais là c'était pas la même chose... du tout !... Mais ce qu'il y a, il fallait être souple ! Ah oui !... D'ailleurs, le directeur me l'avait dit, sans savoir à qui « qui » causait, il m'avait dit : « I’ faut être souple » Alors moi, vous pensez bien que là-dessus je craignais rien ! Hein ! Dites !... Vous me connaissez, hein ?... Dites !… Pas besoin de certificat, moi !... J'ai fait mes preuves !... Pensez bien, moi qui avais pris des leçons avec Serge Nifar, vous devez bien penser que je rigolais. Enfin, c'est ce qui prouve qu'on ne sait pas toujours à qui « qu'on » cause.
Le fait est qu'il fallait être souple parce que j'étais engagé pour faire l'oiseau rare ; j'étais nu, pas nu, nu, mais un petit nu, puis on m'avait mis une plume dans le... comme gouvernail, et je partais comme ça : vous regardez, hein ?...  (Quelques pas en danseuse.) 
Il fallait que je sois léger, aérien, alors j'étais dans mon élément. Puis nous voilà au premier jour du contrat et, comme je ne suis pas bien habitué au music-hall - c'est surtout le classique, n'est-ce pas, il s'est passé une histoire bête... vraiment bête, parce que au moment de m'habiller je me suis trompé ! C'est bête, hein !... Au lieu de me mettre la plume comme gouvernail, je me la suis mise dans les cheveux, c'est bête, hein !... C'est d'autant plus bête que vous devez bien penser que c'était pas la première fois que je voyais un oiseau !... Hein !... Enfin !... Je me suis mis à danser comme ça, mais le directeur qui était dans les coulisses s’en est aperçu, alors il m'a crié : « La plume !... La plume !... » et moi, comble de malheur, je ne comprenais pas, c'est bête, hein !... Vraiment je n'étais pas « subtil » ce jour-là ; même à un moment j'ai cru qu'il voulait que je chante : alors, comme je connais tous mes classiques, je me suis mis à chanter « Comme la plume au vent...» (Rigolletto). J'ai continué jusqu'au bout comme ça, mais en arrivant dans les coulisses vous parlez d'une comédie !... Le directeur était en colère !... Vous parlez !... Mais quand même j'ai ri, parce qu'il est tellement grossier et vulgaire que, franchement, j'ai ri... vous savez... parce qu'il s'est approché tout près de moi et, tout grossier comme il est, il m'a dit : « C'est pas la plume au vent que je veux !... C'est la plume au c... »",La Plume,2004

Nous connûm's des instants doux, 
Tout en faisant un piqu' nique. 
Elle sentait le sable chaud. 
C'était pas mon légionnaire, 
Heureus'ment ce s'rait pas beau 
Si j'aimais un légionnaire. 
Mais un jour ell' m'dit : ""je m'ennuie, 
J'veux r'tourner à ma maison, 
Ainsi partent les jeunes fill's, 
Sitôt qu'ell's ont le bourdon, 
Ell' s'est perdue, j' n'sais où,
Peut-être dans la forêt vierge,

Ben ! j'ai fait brûler un cierge.",Timichine la Pou Pou,2004
Bourvil,"J'ai fait tous les sports, mais celui que je préfère, c'est le vélo parce que j'ai le coup, vous savez, j'appuie sur les pédales et je mouve les jambes vite... C'est formidable, on ne le dirait pas à me voir comme ça !... Mais j'étais unique dans mon patelin, je gagnais toutes les courses, je pourrais même dire que j'étais le seul à être vraiment de la pédale... Peut-être maintenant parce que ça plaît pas à ma femme, puis elle me dit toujours que je finirais par attraper du mal... Mais à ce moment-là j'allais bien en vélo. Je me souviens, ça avait créé des jalousies et un Parisien qui était en vacances dans le patelin avait voulu se mesurer avec moi... Vous pensez, moi, le roi !... Hein !... Enfin je n'ai pas voulu le contrarier, alors nous voilà sur la ligne de départ, et vous savez c'était un type qui bluffait beaucoup, il se faisait appeler le leader de la course… Pensez... le leader !... Qu'il s'appelle n'importe comment, c'était pas ça qui me dérangeait. Puis il était habillé avec des lunettes, puis un petit tricot, puis des culottes courtes ; alors moi, quand j'ai vu ça, j'ai retroussé mes culottes du dimanche jusqu'aux genoux, comme ça j'avais pas l'air plus bête que lui. Enfin, on démarre ; alors tout leader qu'il était il prend la tête ; moi... sans m'en faire, je me mets derrière ; il pédalait... je pédalais... Il se dépêchait... je me dépêchais, plus qu'il les mouvait plus... que je les mouvais (rires) ; alors il ne pouvait pas me décoller. Même que ça ne lui a pas plu, parce que dans un tournant il m'a fait un coup de leader; avec sa roue arrière il m'a pris ma roue de devant, ça fait que j'ai fait le tournant un peu plus grand que j'aurais voulu ; puis justement, là, il y avait une haie et, comme un fait exprès, on aurait dit que la haie était trop près... Alors... vous comprenez... quand... n'est-ce pas... la... le... la haie, je l'ai bien vue, je ne peux pas dire que je ne l'ai pas vue... au contraire, j'avais l'impression qu'elle se foutait dans moi, alors vous comprenez, quand j'y ai touché un peu à la haie... pas beaucoup... un peu avec la tête... je... je suis passé à travers, puis comme c'était une haie d'épines, elle s'est refermée derrière moi, et j'étais resté enfermé dans l'herbage ; alors le temps que j'aille rechercher la barrière qui était à quatre cents mètres, tandis que le leader pédalait toujours... Puis, pour une fois que je mettais un petit tricot rouge, il y avait un taureau dans l'herbage ; voilà qu'il se met à courir derrière moi ; vous parlez si je les mouvais... Heureusement que je suis souple ! Mais un taureau, c'est souple aussi, hein !... Il m'a rattrapé, vous savez... Je le sentais derrière ; vous parlez si j'ai eu peur. Il y a certains taureaux qui ont des cornes en guidon de course, mais pas celui-là... (Faire signe avec les deux index comme deux cornes en l'air.) Je me rendais compte de la situation... On a beau être le roi de la pédale, c'est pas pour ça qu'on galope plus vite qu'un taureau... Je sentais ses naseaux tout près... C'était le moment de dire : il m'y soufflait pour que j'aille plus vite. A un moment il a eu un coup de tête... parce que les taureaux ils ont des coups de tête terribles ; il m'a pris par derrière et hop ! il m'a mis par-dessus la haie. Je suis retombé à côté de mon vélo ; alors, comme je suis persévérant, j'ai voulu continuer la course, mais sur mon vélo j'avais toujours ce cauchemar-là (montrant à la tête) le taureau là !... Pas là ! mais là ! (Mettre ses mains derrière). J'avais l'impression que... surtout que ma selle était un peu pointue. Quand même je suis arrivé... oui... mais la course était finie... Puis tous le monde rigolait parce que mon pantalon était déchiré ; je m'en étais pas aperçu, il ne faisait pas de vent, n'est-ce pas !... Et il y a ma mère qui était là qui me dit : « Alors, mon roi de la pédale, tu as vu ton postérieur ? » Je lui répondis : « Oui, maman qu'est-ce que tu veux, c'est le métier qui rentre ! »",Le Vélo,2004

Bow Wow,"Yeah,
I'm the hottest thing to hit the block since 
From CO to ATL I keeps it live
Like a fresh pair of 23's, once seen
Can't get enough of me, my team
Getting this paper from all angles, which means 
Everybody got a triangle, ya heard me?
I'm ""The Truth"" like Beans
And when it comes to teens in this rap thing
You looking at the rock
Not to mention that I'm hot, yeah you already know
And I shuts down the spot wherever I go
Call me the Tiger Woods of this, young and explosive
I come with the dopest flow at thirteen like whoa

Little girls think that I'm delicious
Grown folks say I'm just too vicious, but they don't understand
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am
Mess with me you get bit
In two-kay I ain't having it, what y'all don't understand?
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am

Lil man with the big checks
Lil man that's got big girls wanting to teach me about sex
I don't care who coming, cause I'm here now
A hundred miles and running, Lil' Bow Wow
Drop bombs like Flex, constantly
And at 6 o'clock you can find me on Craig Street
Can't wait till I can see what the club be bout
Can't wait to get a whip so I can dub it out
I like no gold, I rock corn rows
The only way I know to hit the block is on swoll
Could never get enough dough so I keep grindin
So I can keep shinin and Big Tymin' like Baby

Little girls think that I'm delicious
Grown folks say I'm just too vicious, but they don't understand
It's just the dog in me

In two-kay I ain't having it, what y'all don't understand?
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am

Now my wallets too deep for y'all cats to swim
So if you copy me I'm dissing you like Eminem
I mean straight to your face or live on TV
I might look cute, but it's the dog in me
That makes me wanna tear it up, everything in sight
Jump from girl to girl to stay out all night long
I'm little, but I, get my mack on
With my nick nack patty wack def backbone
Got everybody at home glued to they tube
Waiting to see what I drop new like Clue
Cause when I do what I do I breaks the bank
Cause a dog ain't a dog without a pile of stank

Little girls think that I'm delicious
Grown folks say I'm just too vicious, but they don't understand
It's just the dog in me
And that's just the way I am

I know what pops up in ya head first is ( wait a minute)
How he keep coming up with verses (uh huh)
Well I'm gonna tell ya something and don't get nervous ( alright)
My secret is I'm doing this on purpose( Why)
To get a billion copies purchased
If your style is sick (well) 
Mine is allergic
My rhymes in the beat merges like interstate traffic(ooh my bad)
It's just a habit
I flows it
I know it'll probably illegal
Before the o's before you
Even close to being the COR
Even backwards I'm hard 
And I give my regards
But I ain't rapping with y'all
I'm a year after tomorrow
You can't see me

A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out 
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz 
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas 
Always up in they somebody's face trying to fuss 
And to get where she going she can take the bus 
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame 
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss 
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back 
Attitude like Mary J. Mixed with Brat 
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, ya'll can keep 
Cause only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho) 

Ghetto Girls 
That like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball wit the best of them 
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang
Than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like so tell me baby is that you

When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady 
Snap lile I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's 
Bandannas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all that's good with me 
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O now believe me she got's to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street 
That's all I see like everyday 
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard)

Bow Wow,"Once upon a time
But not too long ago
There was a new liter of puppies
At a place called the dog pound

They're all very cute and adorable
As all puppies are
But in this liter there was one special puppy
This story is about him

",Intro,2000
Bow Wow,"(Oh)
J.E. y'all

Yo I'm looking for girls
(Bow Wow)
Girls that can give me puppy love
Ya know?
(He, he yeah)
Yeah it's goin down right here
West coast, bark on
(Come on)
East coast, bark on
(Come on)
Dirty South, bark on
Yeah
(Come on, come on, come on)

All young girls beware
This pup's off the chains
I'm gritty little something here
Putting down pain
Since I was six
Running with the pound
It's been going down
I'm city to city, town to town
They running up screaming my name
Running up grabbing my chain
Running up tryna get in the game
I'm like ma don't get it twisted
If we kick it get your bark on
Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown
Type of playa but it ain't
It just sounds like that
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
(I agree)
Hit the movies, hit the mall
Then come out with big bags
Next day do lunch then head Six Flags
But it don't mean nothin we're just having some fun
Even though I may have told you on the ride you're the one
I'm sorry little shorty I gotta take that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
So

Even if you're three years older than me
And caught yourself noticing me
In my mind, set don't change
I might up my game
But the story that I tell 'em
When I tell it, it remains the same
You wouldn't believe how they be coming at me
Steady, steady tryna throw something at me
Like I'mma get happy
Just because honey got her learner's permit
Can come and scoop me after school
Like I'm supposed to be on it
Naw ain't no sippin' over here
It's Big Pimpin' over here
And I hope that I make myself clear
That when it comes to honeys yo I got some minutes
And I ain't tryna get serious till I'm up in my twenties
It's just the paper that I'm after
The drop with the top I'mma cop when I'm able
And that's all that matters
So if I told you something shorty
I'm taking that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that

The way you diggin' you puts it down
See this dog just don't bark easy
You gotta be off the heazy, fa sheezy
Make young weezy want to get with it
And lock down all yo digits, talk to you for hours at a time
About whatever comes across ya mind
When we out, girls run up, you don't even trip
You get a kick out of watchin' 'em flip
I want to live for ya slim, I ain't never been like this
But it's cool 'cause I like this
Got you a two way so you don't miss a beat
For the times that I'm workin' and I cannot speak
All my homies tease me say you got me sprung
But they just mad 'cause they ain't got one

You know you look so good, you make me forget about (all I know)

My lil' homie, my road dog
We really kill 'em when we step through the mall lookin just alike
Both got cornrows, two bags each
Both so fresh from our head to our feet
Only disagree when we talk ball play
I say I.V. you say M.J.
You say you w/ me that's when you're mistaken
I ain't Omar Epps & you ain't Sanaa Lathan
How do you? Let's find another subject
A girl that understands, you gotta love that
A yound Sergio Valente, Louis Vutonne
Shell toe rockin' and like to have fun
Fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
Indeed, I'll make the next chick see the exit with speed
Cause you're the only thing that I need

And your album went gold, So you mad at me,
Cause my first joint went triple P, and no matter what I do,
When I step in the tube, the girls they love me,
Only reason that I'm winning this, 'cause I'm a gimmick,
I know that's what your saying, but I came to you're show,
Nobody was in it, and you still think your the man,
What was that, no promo, no radio, I know you got
Something to say,
Its not your fault, cause you hot, but nobody else seem
To feel that way,
See its like this, when you rap people just clap, when I rap
They shed tears, they no that So So C.O flow crazy

Only top it if its true, so stop you're nonsense,

Want me to be,

Think of,
I can swing, it don't mean a thing, cause I got that bling,
Got me a fresh out stylist, house on the hill,
22 inch wheels, take trips to Maui, to closed deals,
I'm so real, notice a cop that pop a female,

Told you I can never be deal to deal, please believe it,

But they do a lot of things they try to, you know
Throw a teddy bears at me, they try to kiss me, grab me
Grab my Mickey Mouse chain

14 and i started up a whole epidemic
Look, y'all know what I'm talking about
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south
TV shows, magazine covers
Girls in groups saying, ""We go with each other.""
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake
What you know about selling tres mil out the gate?
I'm the hottest thing around
Neck full of bling, bling like the Neptune sound
I got it locked on the left, right, front and rear

I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home

Right now, when I'm old, where I'm gonna be
How I flow, homie you can bet the house on me
I'ma forever be up under the scope
I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges off Different Strokes
I was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time
Like the number 2-3 in the red and black
Mr. 106 & Park is back, holla!
I do it like no other
And attract mo' family than Ringling Brothers
I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like hash browns
See I'm the best just ask around
I'm here now, and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can
You better off gettin' a shirt, makin' a sign that reads
""Shad Moss, I'm yo number 1 fan!""

Giving dash to all my folks
Telling little kids

See I'ma keep barking and
Cause y'all bark wit' me
You know the website
All ya gotta do is hit me now
As much as the girls like me
You would think
You'd make the fellas sick
But they'd be right wit' 'em
Singing not listen the lick
Hair braided
Rockin' somebody's jersey
From up top that out west
And down in the dirty
Can't forget about the mid-west 
That's where I was found
That's where I live
That Columbus is the town
I got the paint, you got the paper
A CD, and tape
I signin' and be able to get
A nice big plate of fish
Which is my favorite dish
But without y'all
I couldn't kick it like this

Came before me
All of y'all and the office that

Thank you for your support
And yes, I'm gonna

My dreams came true
Now if you ever made a poster
Or wrote a fan letter
All I'm tryin' to do is
Show you some L-O-V-E
And let you know without y'all 
There is no me

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I love the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruption when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

[Chorus]

I got the rock in my hands
ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders want to sing

[Chorus]

Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

So I bust 'em on the basketball team 'cause basketball's my thing
So let me get up and get myself together, be on my way

Bow Wow,"You know I don't know what it is 
But something about you is so irresistible

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase But I can't stop fanning the fire
I Know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible 
Up close and personal 
Now inescapable 
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical 
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
And irresistible to me 
(Yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I can't stop myself from falling
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no 
(I meant to say no)

But he's irresistible (irresistible)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
(I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical 
Deeper than spritual 
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't you see whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
he's so irresistible
Baby you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful

He's so irresistible 
Up close and personal
Now inescapable

Make a young man make flight reservations
Just step, no intimidation's

Accept no imitations
Should have seen the looks on they faces
The Ice plus light, makes for good conversation
You telling me

But luckily
She stayed for some therapy
I stay pimping heavily
My game spitting thoroughly(ha ha ha)

Since fame came and the bright lights
You gotta release me baby, I can't be tied up
Can't be handcuffed to no chick at the party when I ride up
Cause I gotta mingle, I know I'm great with the lingo
but check it I gotta motivate, I just gotta be single
And yeah like when I see you, yeah like how you jingle
And yeah said I'm a ring you but baby I can't bring you
Can't wait 'til the day comes
When I wake up and I'm eighteen
Not a young pup but a big dog
And I bark loud and I switch cars
It sounds hard but it's not y'all
When I get there that's it y'all
Ninth day of the third month, it's on

Got them big dog speakers bumping up in the back
Got that Snoop Dogg CD is what I insert
Roll down my windows, sounds like a concert
And on a beautiful day, I might just switch to the Rover
""So Fresh So Clean"" like Outkast, a PD can't pull me over
I'm ""Big Pimpin"" like Jay-Z, steady ""Stunning"" like Baby
""I Need A Girl"" like Free, mixed with some Halle Berry
And a little hood which is good like Trina to be my lady
Just call me Cassius Clay, baby cause I'm the greatest
And can't nobody my age can ever ever fade this
I'm unfadeable, I'm untouchable
I'm on a mission now, I'm in transition now
B-O-double-double-O-double, y'all

Gotta be that cat, that guy, that dude
If you want to be Bow, watch how I walk this (OK)
Easy, sit back, listen while I'm talking
Make sure your shoot game is up to par
Make sure you remain number one on ""106th & Park"" (yeah)
Gotta like your girls ghetto, gotta be a headliner
Gotta be a platinum back to back rhymer
I'm game .

[Chorus: x2]

[Bow Wow]
Follow me, follow me but don't lose your grip (ah uh)
Get your cornrows and Shell Toes and learn how to skip
Mix that with a throwback and a flow that's sick
Now hold that pose right there, that's almost it 
And if you want to copy my jewels
Don't go and get no Looney Tunes trying do what I do
Like dude I got more karats than that wascaly Rabbit
And it's a fact that I'm responsible for y'all funny rappers
I try to let it ride for a minute
But every time I kick a sentence it's like y'all re-spit it (yeah)
Readmit into the system right after I did it
You kid, you make a living off the way that I'm living
Copy my image, so I want a percentage
Listen don't be sloppy, I'll show you how to get it
You gotta rhyme hotter, dress proper
So you got a lot a ladies and diamonds in your pocket now

At the mall, at the sneaker store,
Saw her bout a week ago,
Wonder should I speak or no,
But probably not,I bet she got,
A lot of guys on her jock you never know,
But would it hurt me to holla,
Lil' momma hot,
And she got all the signature features her momma got,
(Hey little momma)
Listen momma I'm tired of switching label lets consider dating,
No chasing no wasting ya time, the pleasures mine,
I'ma show you how to shine just sit back and recline,
Cause the ride on stilts my back on swow,
I'm wearing Ross gold at 16 years old,
Right now that don't matter,
I honestly rather be discussing,
The two of us and how we goin' get together,
And wheater you knew it or not,
I was digging ya style,
Loving ya smile, 
Lil' mama you should listen to Bow,

[Chorus]
Hey little Momma,
Mama let me holla a minute,
I know you tired of gimme ya digits but dig it,
Hey little mama,
I ain't trying to spoil ya day,
Just had to say you looking great today,
Say hey little mama,
I'm trying to come over tonight,
And watch a movie if you say it's alright (alright)
Hey little mama,
I'm digging ya smile, 
Loving ya style,
Lil' mama you should kick it wit Bow,

I was thinking I could come over,
And chill wit you tonight and sit next to you on ya sofa,
And maybe pop in a DVD,
And make some popcorn just for you and me,
But see I been on tour for a minute,
I want to come home and settle down for a minute,
You feel me,
If you wit it then let me know,
And if you say yes that you wit it then that's fo sho,
Cause see I came to arrange some things,
I'm talking pick you up from school and arranging things,
You know this dog likes to roam,
But you know I can't come over when ya pops is home,
I think it's about time for you to hang up the phone,
Ya father probably got his ear to the door,
So,
It's best to tell ya I'll just holla tomorrow,
Just hit me on the hip I promise to call,

[Chorus]

I need a lil mama to hang wit the drama,
She know I'ma need her,
She know that I want her,
I'm wishing,
I need somebody,
Someone that can share my time,
A fly and so pretty,
Survive wit a gritty life,
We got it smooth mommy,
While we move through the city life,(what you need)
Need a girl that's really down for sure yea,(said hey yeah)

Sony plays me when I'm up at the station
All of a sudden they got me up in Hot's rotation (it's all love)
When I see 'em, yeah I act like I'm they little brother
But I can't get on Source or the XXL cover (please, just once)
That's why I call myself the mayor
Name me one rap cat who sold out Madison Square (Bow Wow)
But Janet, Michael, and a couple of rock acts
That don't know crap about rap
All these little rap cats is here because of me
All them bubblegum raps is about to see
Swing on tour, came up outta the ceiling
Teasing these girls eyes, just what they was feeling
Over this little rap villain
And

The number one under 21 artist in this nation
The rhyme writer, all the young girls like him
Fellas want to be like him, I got 'em like Pied Piper
Follow my paw print, whatever y'all print in the magazines is nonsense
Stop all this, yakety yakkin
The fact that nobody rapping
Can stack 'em up to the ceiling
Like 30,000 a building now
You got Jigga, Ja, Nelly, Nas, Eminem, and Kiss
But I represent it for all the kids now
Say that I'm bragging, but no rapper in my age bracket
Is making it happen the way that I made it happen, now

[Chorus]

Yeah, You think it's easy don't ya
Want to be Weezy don't ya
I'm a performer homie, you just take it easy won't ya
From Nickelodeon shows to BET
I'm approaching the podium, voters voting for me
Cause I keep it real with 'em, every time I deal with 'em
They ""Bounced With Me"" from the start, and I'm still with 'em
I got the keys to cities I never heard of
And every inner city kid got me turned up
With this CD on replay, so the he say, she say don't affect me
No way, I go on day to day
And continue to make money
Make music, make movies
You can never take this from me (nope)

New age, and a new page
In a book of life but it's looking like
Y'all ain't ready for the new phase
Then I'ma get more mature
Make mistakes, but hey
Everybody did that before
Ever feel like you've been trapped before
Wish you can open up a magic door
Step thought it, just do it
The way that you feel it but cha'll confuse it
Y'all want to show me, keep me secluded 
But this is life I'm bound to go thought it
It's a process y'all gotta digest
Let the boy grow up, want to go out
Have a little fun, if it get a lil' wild, 
Then so what
It's an ounce of experience
Just more than a pine of advice
I hope y'all hearing this, 'cause I'm serious
An it's like, I'm so curious about life 
I'm movin' on

I bet you think you know what you think you know
But I'm different than any one you've seen before
So don't compare me to other thirteen year old's
You seen lookin' cut comin' on the scene to blow
First impression of a young adalesson 
A grown up mind that flow so impressive
Grew up so fast in this profession
A flash of concerts and late night sessions
So much dough, he don't know it's a blessin'
The way he brag, he gon' last one second
But oh contrea don't stop and stare
If I sell my jewelry and cut my hair
Still be here after y'all
Stand this all, I ain't had a chance to ball
So when you doubt me I'll just laugh at cha'll 
Shouting out,fall in love, it ain't a plans at all
But ain't no tellin'
When there's no more sellin' other record end up 
Wit a pen label ends up a record nah
But I still got act in basketball
So if you ain't checkin' for me
I ain't checkin' for y'all
So
Let this be a lesson to y'all 
When a rap acteace
Play professional ball

Or who you listening to
You get one life ain't nobody livin' but you

[Bow Wow]
Young and confused
With nothin' to lose
But somethin' to prove
My hunger my views
I use them as tools
To refuse for the sake of rebellin'
Breaking the rules and yellin'
Telling them to come and walk in my shoe
Come and try it
Be defiant, we pump the heart of a lion
See if you like it
You livin' yo life culturally bias
Cause the ghettos got a bad rep
And we got a bad rap
So we get a half step in the door, get the last laugh, hah,
No future no past we live for the right now
Want us to pipe down,
But this is what life sound like when thugs cry
And I seen love die
And I've seen the hater born
And pawn as they take on form
As they take on
The world is placed on our shoulder
But socially they never know what's up
They approach us with they pre-conceived notions
At least that's what the homies told me

[Chorus; x2]
The celebration, the movement
Man we young and confused
But to ambitious to lose it
You see we loving life
Since we was just critters
They said that we'd be go getters
This is the movement

Like the war thing
I don't know what y'all seen
But my generation is getting caught in the cross beams
No preparation, medication, and vaccines
No reparation for the children who ask things
But get no answers,
They just say pull your pants up
They don't understand us 
But still reprimand us
Demand us to live like this and that and that and this
And it has us pissed and after this
I'll probably be banded 
But I gotta take a stand
Cause you see what happened when Eminem ignored Stan
He just lost it be cautious
See we all targets
My thoughts are sporadic
I feel so asthmatic
Out of breath
Sick of talkin'
So we taking action
Against a democracy
Full of hypocrisy
I know it's more than me
And my hip hop eyes that see
That's what the homie said to me 

[Chorus]

In the world that has so much goin' on
Could leave you paranoid
Like now there's popping noise
Please don't just think it's project boys
Whether your urban life or your suburban knights
It doesn't matter
What matters is if your swerving right
Don't get it twisted
All that happens in suburban life?
Cause dead is dead
Whether in your room or a club at night
But the lords been shining on ya
He said I'm there to calm ya
He said ""I'll be back""
The words like Sara conners
She said we sleepin' on her
Wake up and leanin' on her
We terminated for playin'
Terminator by your honor
We don't want to die
We just want to fly

All before the drama begun
When we first met
I seen you sitting out on your steps
You was broke down crying a mess
So I interfered
I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
But I'll start with ya name
You told me how ya man playing games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I was glad that I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really girl it ain't no rush
I was thinking girl that we can discuss
A future for us
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Trust
I just want to talk
I'm thinking I can give you a call
And we can pick it up
Where we left off
I'll holla tomorrow

Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright aww baby
But that don't change the fact
That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby
Girl you got to let him know
You can't live like this no more
Nah baby
Can't see
Together you and me could be so special ah baby

Our feelings get greater
A million days later
Talking all night we stay up but
Here comes ya ex
Returned with that drama and stress
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
You except and go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart
That I gotta mend
That's unfair
I've only been your lover and friend
And homey there he just front and pretend
But you don't care the life he leads
Is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase
Cat and mouse
First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about
I can't figure you out
Even your friend said I was better
But you listen to him
Never like uh-uh whatever
So the next time hurt you again
You already knew where you should've been
And that's with me

Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright aww baby

That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby

Nah baby
Can't see
Together you and me could be so special ah baby

All the times
You 2way telling me
That you miss me
Wanting me to come over and keep you busy
Remember that
Now that you gone
It's been kinda hard
Can't think, can't sleep
Can't do nothing at all
Just tell me why you had to go back
See you ain't have to go through that
My baby
You could've been here right by my side
Me and you at the park taking walks outside
But
Instead, I keep on having these dreams
Waiting for my phone to ring
My baby wishing that it would be you But I know that won't come true

I'm a young man now
But my plan is to show you that I really understand
Mom, I love you

[Chorus: x2]

Look at you now
You sittin' up on top of the world
Got a X5 and a Benz just to swerve
Gotcha dream house now
Sittin' on big land, big money, big jewels, big game plan
You told me one day I'ma make it this far
Have God in my life and I'm goin' be the star
I did it, well, look where we at
Don't have to worry 'bout past due bills and all that
Don't have to worry 'bout them bill collectors all on yo back
Don't worry
If you ain't got it, I got your back
Don't even worry 'bout you working 3 jobs real late
Don't even have to worry when you have no food to put on the plate
Back then, I didn't understand but I do now
I look back and I reminisce on how it all went down
Went from bad to good, from frowns to smiles
Mom, I really love you, understand now
I love you

[Chorus: x2]

Thank you for loving me
Say what now
Thank you for holding me down
Say what now
I know that you care for me
Sing that
Cause you've always been around
Kick it back and
Thank you for loving me
Say what now
Thank you for holding me down
Say what now
I know that you care for me
Say what
Cause you've always been around
Drop the beat back

So make room next to your little Backstreet poster
'Cause Bow Wow's here an' it's over, ya heard?
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
In a big body shot, ridin' on dubs

I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
An' I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya know I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets, all I hear sayin' is

First to drop, ice in the bezel of a G Shock

What makes it even worse, I'm just gettin' started
Yeah, that's me that's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah, that's me that's got her arguin' with her friends

About who gone? Gimme when they see me
Sayin', ""Do you see him?"", ""Ooh, he the man""

I just thought I'd breathe on you all for a second
Matter a fact
Lemme holla at you all

Make girls fall out
Lose they mind
Girl fighting over me like Brooke Valentine (ha, ha)
I Been known get down and do my thing
Got women over 35
Screaming my name (Bow Wow)
Flow so insane
Every time I drop
Making hits after hits
No
I won't stop (no)
Lil Kids to adults
Rapping my songs
If you though JD wrote this
You wrong (it's me)
If you ask me how I'm living
I'll tell you I'm great
Money stacks taller than the Empire State (damn)
Hottest thing since the LL and Kool Moe beef
You can line them guys up
But I put 'em to sleep (that's right)
I'm the B-O-W (Who?)
W-Oooo-W
And these cats know how it go
Since 13 I've been known for bumping out that steam
Ain't nothing changed homeboy
I'm still bringing the heat

[Chorus: x2]
And I got a
Pocket full of dough
Sold out shows
Stepping out the Phantom
With the suicide do's
Yeah (I'm Bow)
I'm the B-O-W

I'm known as the low key don
Get up out the stores like Pokemon
Did (ha, ha)
I ain't impressed by the stuff that you all did
The stuff that you all did
I'm way beyond it (uh huh)
I'm in the Phantom
Hop out handsome
Can't nobody do it like my grand mama grandson (naw)
Rock shades and some Bathing Apes
New cars every time they changing shapes
I had cake before
I got a lot more
Way before I did the first scream tour (damn)
Whole crowd roar
Whole team soar
Bring it up the back and my whole team score (that's right)
Might scoop shorty take her with me to the mall
Spend a few G's
Show her how a player ball (oww)
Hit her later show her how a player call

Bow Wow,"Its not me exactly, that touches people
Its what I represent
The possibility that dreams long ago, may still come true
Even if they look lost forever

I had a homie named Tony, 16, 6'2
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time he was in love wit the block
All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slang, and all the funds
He just got a letter of intent from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love'em and they wish he was there
He had it made like special-ed, about to get the bread
But chose to do somethin' dumb instead
Go to war wit the crew on the other side of town
And was mo ready, and Tony got laid down
He ain't even have a chance
Died for the ambulance even got to'em
So many went through'em
I hate ta tell the story but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid

[Chorus: x2]
When you got big dreams,
Don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams,
Keep ya eyes on the prize don't fall to the way side

I know a girl name Gina
That was a hell of a singer
And everybody fell in love wit her when they seen her
Baby girl was on a verge of signing a big deal
18, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga
Do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came picked her up, told her lets ride
That's the same night that he watched her die
They was trying to hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end ta the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wasn't right
Now he gotta deal wit for the rest of his life
And the part I don't like, he ain't even get grazed
But the home girl Gina, is layin' in the grave

[Chorus]

I got a few relatives that give the family drama
Always got they hand out when they see me and my momma
One could of been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen he was cookin' something else
Now his life in the drain
A trifling shame
He all washed up
Wife took everything
No car, no mo, no house
And everywhere he go he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' lookin' up to be like them
Now I''m throwin' up cash, rollin' up in a Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had as a shortie
I'll be damned if I let another man support me
Now, uncle June Buck sit, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
Every time he get his welfare checks,he don't care
If you want to see him got to the crack house, he there

Got the whole crowd screaming lil bow wow.
Without the lil but I'm still on top back 
With sad record sales won't flop (nah)

New Porsche no box earrings chain on no
Watch (that's big) picture a grandfather clock with diamonds, 
That's just the kinda mind state that I'm in.
Caviar, Cartier, carter-drop on my neck call her dear cute shorty called lenier (come here).

Coming different every summer. 
Don't be amazed cause of me,
Be amazed cause the v came with a five year opped out lease (yea) 
That's cause I paid what I paid if you
Paid like I'm paid den yo cribs came wit the maids 
And if it didn't den you slipping catch up but by the time you do I'll probably do it different.

Rude for the hell of it, I should be the president hey yo homey
Doggy dogg got the medicine (where, where?) in the cabinet, 
I'm the magnet, of attracting the badest bitches on the planet dig it. 
I once was a pup never scared to run up I did it till the day I came up and stars do shine, 
I take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind first I, 
Chop um and den some, flop um den flip um, break um and bend um,

106 & Park ain't been the same since I had so I'm back at it
Freeze
Still the juvenile at 400 degrees
Lil girls still falling out
I'm still balling
Crawling out the hottes B's on these ATL streets
From the garden to the box office
I shuts down both
And it don't matter where I go
I'm still O-H-I-O
Everybody know this is my turf
Who had it crunk first
And had girls at all ages off one verse
You
And nobody else can name
Another 17 year old mane
That do it this hard so hard
That's what them old niggas say about me
Young niggas play can't go a day without me
If the bling was a drug
I'd die from an overdose
Fresh princes sugar loaf
Homie I'm the most you've seen
I got the same affects on both coasts
And everything hot on fur wheels
Homie I'm ghost

Do you
Stop trying to be me
Stop trying to be he
Stop trying to do what you see

Cause this right here is mine lil homie
Go back to where you came from and get your own lil homie

It's so so sloppy and the fans know a copy when they see one
I would never wanna be one

As long as it sound right
Everybody in town like it don't worry bout nobody else

Not just the rap game
The whole industry the same
Everybody wanna sound and look like the next mane
But I'm definite there ain't another me
And I'm so so def'n it

Something to talk on
Breath stretch let it go

Get up out them stores quick

When I was 8 I was rhyming not back yard game playing
Watching Snoop anxiously and waiting for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I know that I am man 
I'm going down in history like American Band stand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep coming wit dough man
You steady watching stealing but there ain't no hope man
You dealing with something bigger than the US oh man
And ain't no joking
Fresh like fat-laces and dukey ropes and I keep on smoking
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm stroking
Look at me now days girl a dog is poking

From records to movies now a tv show man
Anything given to me I'm goin' rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breaking they neck man 
Blinded by the light glistening off the brake lane
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't trying to go prep

Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara

Especially when they trying to stunt thinking they hot 
All out the window talking loud like they running my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man 
Tired of making girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quick sand

Cause I stay trying to find me a pretty young thing

And if sun'it jump off she be ready to bang

To graduate short shirts ed'day trying t show they little shape
Low cut jump jeans Lugz on hea feet

In a party she the main one doing that right there
Every time he a jam drop hands up in the air.
And she ain't thinking you, she ain't thinking bout he a here
And if you balling homie she don't even really curr

Wanna be down!""

I'm that girl loving, car dubbing, rims scrubbing, teen
I've been bad to the bone, since I stepped on the scene
I've been club ready, 'bout my feady, game so mean
Hypnotizing these hoes, like they gone off that lean
I'm that track flipping, up one dipping, he can do whatever man
If you 12in this, man then I kno that's what your saying
I'm the house-wrecker, mic-checker, homie with a plan
If I said it, then I did it, lil nigga, I'm the man,
I'm that trend-settin', big-bettin', always looking fly
I'm that cocky, poppin', ain't no stoppin', reachin' for the sky
I'm a boss player, baby aint another like I
Screamin' live homie, ""you can't take it with you when you die""
C'mon

Girls beatin' down my dow (door)
With me thats how it goes
A hundred thou' a show
Me making records, movies, and tv shows
It equals mo money, mo money, mo money, mo money, mo money,

""where you live?""
Nah nigga, mind ya business, you probably wouldn't even find the shit
Diamond rings, hood rich, like it's something bitch, and I'ma have a lil fun with this
I'm a straight better, game checker, ""put-her-in-her-place""
So poof, yea she disappear, gone without a trace
Summer rocking the black prada kicks without the lace,

Car switching by the day, stuttin' all through the a
Hands up crunk like lil' scrappy ""okay-k-k""
I'ma genius like ray, for my downfall niggas pray, but I
Careless what a nigga might say, especially when they keep trying to get in my way
New sneakers, pockets way deeper than yours
I'm a junkie for this, you can smell it coming out of my pores
Unlike y'all lil homies, I'm getting up out of the stores

Bring it up the back and my whole team score

Hit her later, show her how a player call

Bow Wow,"Intro
its not its not me exactly 
who touches people
its what i represent
the possibility that dreams from long ago
may still come true even if they look lost forever

Verse One:

I had a homie named Tony
16, 6""2'
headed to the NBA
straight from high school
my nigga had his ball game on lock
but at the same time 
he was in love with the block
all the stuff that came wit it
the drugs and the guns
the gangs, the slang
and all the funds
he just got a letter of intent
from the Cavaliers
sayin how they love him 
and they wish he was there
he had it made like special ed
about to get the bread
but chose to do something dumb instead
go to war with the crew on the other side of town
and was more ready
then Tony got laid down
he aint even have a chane
died before the ambulance
even got to him
so many went through him
I hate to tell the story
but thats how it is
growin up in tha hood
as a kid

Chorus:

When you got big dreams
dont listen to what nobody say
and dont let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams
keep your eyes on the prize
dont fall to the waste side
When you got big dreams
dont listen to what nobody say
and dont let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams
keep your eyes on the prize
dont fall to the waste side
reach for the sky

Verse Two:

I knew this girl named Gina
that was a hell of a singer
and everybody fell in love 
with her when they seen her
babygirl was on the verge 
of signing a big deal
eighteen, and life looked so surreal
She was stuck wit a dude 
that was all bad news
and all he ever did was give
baby the blues
but she was true to a nigga
do for a nigga
pop you and ya whole crew 
for a nigga
One night he came
picked her up 
told her lets ride
thats the same night
that he watched her die
they was tryna hit a lick
but the lick hit back
put a end to the deal 
and all of that
she aint even have to be there
he knew it wasn't right
now he gotta deal with it 
for the rest of his life
and the part i dont like
he aint even get graze
but homegirl Gina
is layin in the grave

Chorus:

When you got big dreams
dont listen to what nobody say

Verse Three:

I got a few relatives
given family drama
always got they hands out
when they see me and my momma
One coulda been a doctor 
the other a chef
but when he got his own kitchen 
he was cookin somethin else
Now his life in the drain
a triflin shame
He all washed up
wife took everything
No car no mo' no house
and everywhere he go
he stole
so they throwed him out
I was growin up 
lookin up to be like them
Now Im throwin up cash 
rollin up in the Benz
I was stuck wit a dream
I had since a shorty
I be damned if i let 
another man support me
now uncle Junebucks sick
skinny as hell
he got AIDS in his body 
from the needles he shared
everytime he get his welfare checks
he dont care
You wanna see him go to the crack house
he there

At the game close enough to grab rebounds
I'm in town on a Friday,
Gone on a Saturday,
Back on a Monday
Was home about one day
Who else you know is cooler than a fan that can plan getaway trips,
Chilling on that all black sand.
I'm getting tanned in the wintertime
Chefs when its dinnertime
Won't be seen around with nothing less than a dime
I got the game,
Know the slang and the language
Left in the range and came back in a vanquish
I got accounts on accounts
Thats amounts on amounts
At any given time I can bounce south

Now what day of the week is it (i don't know)
It don't even matter
I don't even hear them dudes,
With the whispers and the chatters
I be gone in that 0-7
Steering and accelerating
Jumped in the wheels and I can't keep the pedal waiting
Celebrating every single chance that I get to
Make them other girls pissed off when I'm with you
You seen that side of hate at the mall the we went to
You seen what I spent boo?
That's a light issue
I play wit it
Everything stay kitted
Got that 59-50
On that book ass fitted
They be like that man did it
Still black card living
When its time for some action,
All the girls be wit it
That's my lifestyle girl,
I'm the one you wanna holla at
Forget yesterday,

Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winkin' eyes at me when I roll up on dem dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm wit' my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right I'm a flirt
So, homie, don't bring your girl to me to meet 'cause I'm a flirt
And, baby, don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause I'm a flirt 
(It better be real tight too, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Please believe it unless your game is tight, and you trust her

All the ladies think I'm handsome
Jewelry shining, I stay stuntin'
That's why these niggas can't stand 'em
I'm a chick magnet

And if she got a man, I don't care
Ten toes, and I wanna be 'cause I gotta have it

I'm a boss, and you know it

If I give yo' girl one chance to talk to me, homie, she ain't gon' blow it
And I stay fly, my game's so tight

Creppin' all over the floor wit' his girlfriend in da club
And wonder why all these playas tryin' a holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga, I'm a holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could, man, I would probably walk out wit' all of y'all
Yeah, yeah, homie, you say she yo' girlfriend
But when I step up to her, I'ma be like buzzin' and
Believe me, man, this is how dem playas do it in the Chi

Oh, I'm much wiser than you think that I act like, you know
Just because I'm a teen it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie, boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
You gotta go now, back up off me

One day, wheezy
Baby, tonight's the night
And them girls are on me like white on rice
And I get them to the crib late, two on one
I'm already high, now it's you I want
Take a jet into the sunset, you won't come
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up your little wrists till you're blue and numb, um
You're dealin' with a buster, mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
If I were you, I'd tell my homies ""I'll holla""
And if your man ain't me, why bother?

Number one spot: Wayne and Paula

Uh oh, got them going crazy, you see, uh oh

I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H.U.E.Z. and Bow Weezy
Let's see if she can get lower than before on the remix

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)

Pop lock and drop it (8x)

Damn lil mama I'm sayin'
All that in them jeans woo
Aye, aye, let me holla at you for a minute

Hey what it is they call me Bow Wizzle
Now pop lock and drop it for me, make that thang jiggle (yep)
She moves her hips just like Shakira
If she was in a contest she would be the winner (yep)
From Ohio all the way to St. Louis, hey all the girls do it just put your back into it
Now shake what she gave you, I'm talking bout ya mama
If you wont do it for me then do it for these dollas
Cause I'ma make it rain, these other dudes is lame
They talk a good game, but they can't do the same
Now drop it up and down, now take it to the ground
If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it poppin'
Man I'm a pro, look I'm far from a rookie
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them cookies

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)

Pop lock and drop it (8x)

Shorty snap (yeah!)
Damn, shorty snap (shaw-d-et)
Yea
Now let me ask you a lil' question that you never heard
How do you make them dollas disappear like Copperfield for a lack of better words
Let me introduce my friend, that's Huey and Bow Wow
And I'm the pain better known as Teddy Bend her ass down
I'ma G (yea)
But, you probably already knew that
But you didn't know that I can make you pop, lock, Drop and do that
Now understand I'm the baddest man alive
So let's just bend your knees and do the G 5 (now we fly)
Yea now you can do it (yea)
Yea now you see me (yea)
Yea you wanna be me (yea)
Yea you got my cd (yea)
Yea that's Hits Committee(yea)
Yea that's Baby Huey (yea)
Yea that's Bow Weezy (yea)
Yea that's Teddy Pain I'ma make you climb the pole
I'ma play you depending on how this money unfold
And I got it from my mama I ain't tryin' a go pro
If you pop lock drop it I might let all of this go
Ooh

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)

Lil mami I'm trying to cop sumtin', I'm in da club now tearin' up

Look, it's like this girl got me going all out

Catch a movie, grab a bite, then fall out
I got her spoiled rotten
She keep a dog droppin'
The latest wear she rockin'
Gotta get tour poppin' (fresh)
It was more shockin'
Them whores at the door knocking
And word for a second my g shock went
She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid
The only time we fight is on the Wii boxin'
I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend
Usually I keep a safe but the key locked in
But she a new type, maybe a new wife, 
Maybe the one I settle with in a new life
I gotta see, it's moving fast right now
I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow
Cause ahhh

[Chorus]
I had a few loves before, 
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down,
But you made proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before,
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

Like wha?

Like this

Like wha?

Like dadadada like this girl

I guess I'm kinda open
Just sitting here hoping that what we shared is more than a joke and
We can last like the great ones do,
As long as our love for each other stays true
Look
I see the growth, we done both came a long way
Arguments here and there,
Fuss and fightin'
Just showing that we care
Can't nobody else compare
Start it over with another, neither one of us were there
All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there
Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair
Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years
Try my hardest not to hurt her,
Hate to bring her to them tears
And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear
No, I let her drive a stick, 
She know how to work dem gears
Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career
Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears

[Chorus:]

She's my L-O-V-E
Used to be scared of relationships but this one I can't deny
You my L-O-V-E
Yeah, and when you see her, you see me for her
I ride or die like Ruff Ryders

And she said she like when I work the middle yup when I hurt the middle
She don't want to be with you because ya thing too little (ha ha)
Charge that one to the game
Ain't nothin' little over here ma not even the name (uh uh)
Hit the floor all up in the crib
Don't worry the mess the maids will fix it
Take the girls to the crib they don't know how to act
When I get them back to my bachelor pad

Now if I take your girl thats too bad
Live so far,she like my swag
Make her do tricks like a circus act
Once I get her back to my bachelor pad

Now if I hit your girl thats too bad
You so lame and she likes my swag
Make her do flips like a acrobat
Once I get her back to my bachelor pad

She told me I was better then that and this is the new world she never bend out and stretch
Neva got wet in the jacuzzi heart shaped never seen her pride relax
Sneak in the back never seen nothing like this before
Platinum forces with the royal doors
Stacks so clean you can eat off the floor

Let me take you on a private tour
I don't even got door knobs on my door
They just move when they hear my voice
Yup that's Egyptian marble on that floor
So my crib got chinchilla hips I swear come take a feel yo chill in there
Well the liquor might spill in there I got a movie room we can make a film in there (ha ha)
You know the pad got a elevator in it

So ma just come through and get elevated in up in here
For quite a minute I even ain't seen the kitchen
I just hit the intercom and tell the waiter get it (get it)
I got 20 man staff
That can get it right when I need a mid-night snack
Tonight ma you goin' be my mid-night snack
Turn my room to a coupe watch the roof retract

Now if I take your girl thats too bad
Live so far, she like my swag
Make her do tricks like a circus act
Once I get her back to my bachelor pad

Now if I hit your girl thats too bad
You so lame and she like my swag
Make her do flips like a acrobat
Once I get her back to my bachelor pad

We walk they light up like Billy Jean video
And my bar got Neon lights
So when I lick her I'm a lick her dance for hundreds on the dance flo
I got a dancin' pole up on my dance flo'
So it ain't no tellin' where my hands go
So if my hands go low
Then let ya pants go
Seven star see I'm on the 12th flow

Its the antidote
I got a indoor pool ma come and get ya panties soaked (Yup!)
Hop in and splash once I get ya back to my bachelor pad

Now if I take your girl that's too bad
Live so far, she like my swag

Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty

All I wanted was to see her naked!

I gave you a foot massage I gave you my ring
You left me for a drummer cause you said I couldn't sing

It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out
On sleeping with your roommate every time you passed out

I think that my girlfriend
Is bad for my mental health

She was gonna shake her ass

A tale of a fateful trip,
That started from this tropic port,
Aboard this tiny ship.

The mate was a mighty sailing man,
The skipper brave and sure.
Five passengers set sail that day,
For a three hour tour, a three hour tour.

The weather started getting rough,
The tiny ship was tossed,
If not for the courage of the fearless crew,
The minnow would be lost, the minnow would be lost.

The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle,
With Gilligan,
The Skipper too,
The millionaire and his wife,
The movie star,
Professors and Mary Ann's
Here on Gilligan's Isle.

So this is the tale of our castaways,
They're here for a long, long time.
They'll have to make the best of things,
It's an uphill climb.
The first mate and his skipper too,
Will do their very best,
To make the others comfortable,
In the tropic island nest.
No phones, no lights, no motor cars,
Not a single luxury.
Like Robinson Crusoe,
It's primitive as can be.
So join us here each week my friend,

I guess that makes me the luckiest loser

I met her at a kegger, passed out in the yard
Getting in her pants wasn't really that hard
6 months later, she crashed my car
That was rad

She's got a glow from her spray on tan
Marilyn Manson is her favorite band
I really think she might worship Satan

Did you fall in love
Or did you just wanna get some?

And did I mention that you both suck.com?

Like Celebrity Golf with Alice Cooper

You deserve each other
A 'Lethal Weapon' when you take her home
To meet your mother

She was a superstar

Bowling for Soup,"It was so long ago 
That feels so strange to say 
How does eighteen years ago 
Seem just like yesterday 
A hundred kids from around the world 
On a ship to the great unknown 
Two boys for every girl 
You had never been away from home 
You were drinking something really green 
Hopping around like a grasshopper 
I was sipping diesel gasoline 
Then I threw up on the mezzanine

I wonder if it ever crosses your mind 
'Cause I'm afraid its something I dwell on all of the time 
I hear your doing amazing, and 
Believe me that makes me smile 
But I hope you think of me every once in a while 

We watched the stars shine 
Ate chicken by the slot machines 
I was with a friend of mine 
He got into your roommate's jeans 
We danced to Aerosmith 
And then we watched the sun appear 
I took a bracelet from your wrist 
You took an earring from my ear 
You twisted one last twirl 
Then kissed me so fuckin' hard 
And all at once our friends would leave 
Our hair tangled in the ocean breeze 
You told me you loved me 
I asked you if you were sure 
You said you thought so 
And then I said that I loved you too 

I wonder if it ever crosses your mind 
'Cause I'm afraid its something I dwell on all of the time 
I hear your doing amazing, and 
Believe me that makes me smile 
But I hope you think of me every once in a while 

Georgia girl meets Texas boy 
Place in time so far away 
Like Leonardo DiCaprio 
But our ship sank a different way 
A lifetime in four short days 
Said goodbye and we never looked back 
A few letters always ended the same 
I love you, did you know that? 

I wonder if it ever crosses your mind 
'Cause I'm afraid its something I dwell on all of the time 
I hear your doing amazing, and 
Believe me that makes me smile 
But I hope you think of me every once in a while 

Yeah I hope you think of me every once in a while",Graduation Trip,2011
