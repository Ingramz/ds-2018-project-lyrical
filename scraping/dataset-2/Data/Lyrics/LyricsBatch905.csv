Beatrice Egli,"Sein Blick er lacht mich an
Er zog hier ein gleich neben an
Er ist ein Bild von Mann
Wie ein Magnet zieht er mich an
Und er lädt mich ganz frech ein
Und sagt ganz cool komm doch mit rein
Ich möcht' heut' Nacht nicht allein sein

Ja wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur
Heute Nacht bleib ich bei dir
Du bist mir sieben Sünden wert
Die Sehnsucht brennt in mir

Doch wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur
Heute Nacht wird was passieren
Dann sollst du in der Hölle schmoren
Das würde ich nicht riskieren

Er nimmt sich meine Hand
Er bringt mich um, um den Verstand
Er küsst mich dann ganz Zart
Er macht mich schwach
Auf seine Art
Und er nimmt mich in den Arm
Und sagt mit sein George Clooney Charm
Lass uns heute Nacht in den Himmel fahren

Ja wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur
Heute Nacht bleib ich bei dir
Du bist mir sieben Sünden wert
Die Sehnsucht brennt in mir

Doch wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur
Heute Nacht wird was passieren
Dann sollst du in der Hölle schmoren
Das würde ich nicht riskieren

Ja wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur
Heute Nacht bleib ich bei dir
Du bist mir sieben Sünden wert
Die Sehnsucht brennt in mir

Doch wenn du denkst, du denkst, dann denkst du nur
Heute Nacht wird was passieren
Dann sollst du in der Hölle schmoren
Das würde ich nicht riskieren","Ja, wenn Du Denkst ...",2013
Beatrice Egli,"Drei Uhr früh
Zwei Tränen gehen auf reisen
Wo, wo bist du
Zwei Tränen die Beweisen
Ohne dich ist alles kalt und leer
Du fehlst mir so
Du fehlst mir hier so sehr

Ich will dich jetzt und hier für immer
Ich will den wahnsinn jeden Tag
Will deinen Duft in meinem Zimmer
Weil ich die Sehnsucht nicht ertrag

Ich will dich jetzt und hier für immer
Ich will den Himmel jede Nacht
Und Tag zu Tag
Wird es immer schlimmer
Du hast mich willenlos gemacht

4uhr früh, Gedanken in mir kreisen
Du und ich, wie konnte es so entgleisen
Unser Traum von lebenslangen Glück
Ich halt ihn fest und wünsche dich zurück

Ich will dich jetzt und hier für immer
Ich will den wahnsinn jeden Tag
Will deinen Duft in meinem Zimmer
Weil ich die Sehnsucht nicht ertrag

Ich will dich jetzt und hier für immer
Ich will den Himmel jede Nacht
Und Tag zu Tag
Wird es immer schlimmer
Du hast mich willenlos gemacht

Beatrice Egli,"Ich geh' heut Nacht aus endlich wieder Tanzen gehen
Das Herz an Herz Gefühl und wieder diesen Rhythmus spüren
Dann kommt dieser Mann, und tanzt mich von der Seite an
Er flüstert mir ins Ohr, wie man nur so schön sein kann

Deinen türkis blauen Augen,
Werd' ich heut' Nacht kein Kuss weit trauen
Nein, ich habe dich total durchschaut

Mein Herz es brennt, wenn ich dich seh'
Auch wenn ich heut' durch die Hölle geh'
Mein Herz es brennt so lichterloh
Will nur tanzen und dich sowieso
Mein Herz es brennt, wenn ich dich seh'
Ich red' mir ein, dass ich nicht auf dich steh'
Mein Herz es brennt total verliebt
Ist schon klar, dass es kein morgen gibt

Er dreht mich im Kreis, mein Herz schlägt im Dreivierteltakt
Ich bin ihm verfallen, weil er mich grad so glücklich macht
Doch ich spür' in mir, er ist genau der Typ von Mann
Nur für den Moment nicht ein ganzes Leben lang

Deinen türkis blauen Augen,
Werd' ich heut' Nacht kein Kuss weit trauen
Nein, ich habe dich total durchschaut

Mein Herz es brennt, wenn ich dich seh'
Auch wenn ich heut' durch die Hölle geh'
Mein Herz es brennt so lichterloh
Will nur tanzen und dich sowieso
Mein Herz es brennt, wenn ich dich seh'
Ich red' mir ein, dass ich nicht auf dich steh
Mein Herz es brennt total verliebt
Ist schon klar, dass es kein morgen gibt

Mein Herz es brennt, wenn ich dich seh'
Auch wenn ich heut' durch die Hölle geh'
Mein Herz es brennt so lichterloh
Will nur tanzen und dich sowieso
Mein Herz es brennt, wenn ich dich seh'
Ich red' mir ein, dass ich nicht auf dich steh'
Mein Herz es brennt total verliebt
Ist schon klar, dass es kein morgen gibt

Mein Herz es brennt!",Mein Herz,2013
Beatrice Egli,"Der Fernseher der Rauscht
Ich schau auf die Uhr
Es ist spät
Doch wo bleibst du nur
Mein Herzschlag hält mich wach
Und ich laufe durch die Nacht
Du bist nicht allein
Das spüre ich genau
Du bist heute bei einer anderen Frau
Zwei Tränen im Gesicht
Und fließen nur für dich
Ich schließe meine Augen
Und schlaf' ein, allein
Und wieder dieser Traum von Glücklich sein
Oh nein

Das mit dir
Das mit mir
Das kann doch nie zünde sein
Du und ich das geht nie
Lass unsere Träume nicht allein
Auch wenn mein Herz in Scherben liegt
Ich bin noch nicht besiegt
Das mit dir
Das mit mir
Vergeht doch nie

Die Tür sie geht auf
Und du kommst herein
Ein kalter Kuss
Und du lässt mich allein
Ich halte den Atem an
Die Liebe ist vergangen
Du legst dich zu mir
Dein Blick, er verrät
Es ist geschehen
Es ist zu spät
Zwei Tränen im Gesicht
Und fließen nur für dich
Ich schließe meine Augen
Und schlaf' ein, allein
Und wieder dieser Traum von Glücklich sein
Oh nein

Das mit dir
Das mit mir
Das kann doch nie zünde sein
Du und ich das geht nie
Lass unsere Träume nicht allein
Auch wenn mein Herz in Scherben liegt

Das mit mir
Das kann doch nie zünde sein

Lass unsere Träume nicht allein
Auch wenn mein Herz in Scherben liegt
Ich bin noch nicht besiegt
Das mit dir
Das mit mir
Vergeht doch nie",Das mit Dir,2013
Beatrice Egli,"Vollmond kurz nach Mitternacht
Denk an dich und lieg' noch wach
Ich ziehe dein Pyjama an
Weil ich nicht schlafen kann
Dieser Duft verzaubert mich
Schatten zeichnen dein Gesicht
Träume mich heute Nacht zu dir
Die Sehnsucht brennt in mir

Ich will's tausend mal und nur mit dir
Bis in die ewigkeit
Tausend mal will ich die Liebe spüren
Die pure Zärtlichkeit
Ich will das Leben, will das alles sich dreht
Ich will's Tausend mal und nur mit dir
Bis nichts mehr geht

Herz an Herz
Vermisse dich
Seh' dein Bild im Kerzenlicht
Gefühle fahren Achterbahn
Ruf ich dich heute Nacht an
Das Telefon in meiner Hand
Träume mich ins Niemandsland
Gebe deine Nummer ein
Ich bin heute so allein

Ich will's Tausend mal und nur mit dir
Bis in die ewigkeit
Tausend mal will ich die Liebe spüren
Die pure Zärtlichkeit
Ich will das Leben, will das alles sich dreht

Beatrice Egli,"Du warst mein Held
Warst immer für mich da
Der Anruf du bist fort
Ging mir so nah
Dein Schicksal hat dich von deinem Leid befreit
Vom ewiglangen Schmerz, du warst bereit

Wir zwei unzertrennlich
Wir zwei unvergänglich

Und was auch geschieht
Ich hab dich lieb
Bis in die Ewigkeit

Beatrice Egli,"Ja ich genieß' das Leben
Ich schlaf' so gut wie nie
Ich lebe meine Träume
Den Zauber, die Magie
Ich denke nie an morgen
Ich schau niemals zurück
Ich kenne keine Sorgen
Und lache mich ins Glück

Verlieben, verloren, gelacht und geweint
Ich bin manchmal glücklich und manchmal allein
Die Sonne im Herzen, das Glück in meinem Arm

Verlieben, verloren, gelacht und geweint
Ich geb' niemals auf, ich versuch es allein
Umarme die Welt, weil sie mir so sehr gefällt

Ja ich kann niemals warten
Will alles und zwar gleich
Ich tanze mit den Sternen
In meinem Königreich
Ich glaube an die Liebe
Ich glaube fest an sie
Doch heute will ich leben

Beatrice Egli,"Du lügst mich an
Fragst ob ich verzeihen kann
Schaust mir dabei ins Gesicht
Mein Herz zerbricht
Du bist enttarnt
Hab dich 1000 mal gewarnt
Du bist angeklagt
Des Hofverrats
Nimm die Strafe an und sei ein Mann

Zum Teufel mit dir
Es ist längst vorbei

Zum Teufel mit dir
Weil ich ohne dich kann
Hab's niemals geglaubt
Und ich schaff es doch
Es ist aus und vorbei
Ein schönes Leben noch

Du hast verloren
Du hast einen Eid geschworen
Und dein falsches Alibi
Das hält doch nie
Das Schwurgericht
Glaubt dir deine Lügen nicht
Keine Revision

Beatrice Egli,"Auf die Plätze fertig
Auf die Plätze fertig ins Glück
Ich hab so ein Gefühl
Heute könnt für immer sein
Und ich kann es spüren
Damit bin ich nicht allein
Deine Blicke sagen mir
Lass doch mal die Sorgen frei
In Lichtgeschwindigkeit fliegen sie an uns vorbei

Lass uns keine Zeit verlieren
Zusammen kann uns nichts passieren
Glück wird immer größer wenn mans miteinander teilt
Ich will auf die Plätze fertig
Auf die Plätze fertig ins Glück
Dieses Feuer brennt nur für uns in diesen Augenblick
Ich will auf die Plätze fertig
Auf die Plätze fertig ins Glück
Durch die Nacht bis hintern Horizont

Und nie mehr zurück
Zwischen dir und mir
Ein kleiner Funken Ewigkeit
Wir können nichts dafür
Unsre Herzen geh'n zu weit

Lass uns keine Zeit verlieren
Zusammen kann uns nichts passieren
Glück wird immer größer wenn mans miteinander teilt
Ich will auf die Plätze fertig
Auf die Plätze fertig ins Glück
Dieses Feuer es brennt nur für uns in diesen Augenblick
Ich will auf die Plätze fertig

Ich tanze durch den Sommerregen
Will mich in tausend Arme legen

Beatrice Egli,"Nehm Träume für bare Münze
Schwelge in Phantasie
Hab mich in dir gefangen
Weiß nicht wie mir geschieht
Wärm mich in deiner Stimme
Leg mich zu Ruh in deinem Arm
Halt mich nur ein bisschen
Bis ich schlafen kann

Fühl mich bei dir geborgen
Setz mein Herz auf dich
Will jeden Moment genießen
Dauer ewiglich
Bei dir ist gut Anlehnen
Glück im Überfluss
Dir willenlos ergeben
Find ich bei dir Trost

Bin vor Freude außer mir
Will langsam mit dir untergehen
Kopflos, sorglos
Schwerelos in dir verlieren
Deck mich zu mit Zärtlichkeiten
Nimm mich im Sturm
Die Nacht ist kurz
Friedvoll, liebestoll, überwältigt von dir
Schön, dass es dich gibt

Komm, erzähl mir was
Plauder auf mich ein
Ich will mich an dir satt hören

Through the perishing
winter nights and days,

That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.
Please don't turn away
Or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight,
Among a lot of ""might have beens""!

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

Beatriz Adriana,"Unos dicen que el hombre no llora
Otros dicen que el hombre es el rey
Yo les digo que todo es mentira
Que el hombre si llora por una mujer

Nada importa que sea muy valiente
Ni que tenga medallas de honor
Porque el hombre se vuelve cobarde
Y pierde su orgullo por un gran amor

Y llora por ella, Y toma licor
Y aunque sea mucho hombre se arrastra y se humilla nomas por su amor
Y que el hombre sera el que gobierna

Claramente lo dice la ley
Pero basta el embrujo de un beso

Y de ese momento, La Reina es el Rey
Nada importa que sea muy valiente
Para todo le sobra el valor

Y tampoco a podido evitarlo
También a llorado por un gran amor

Y llora por ella, Y toma licor
Y aunque sea mucho hombre se arrastra y se humilla nomas por su amor

Por eso les digo
No importa la ley",La Reina Es el Rey,1988

Creyendo que sólo con mucho cariño
Podría darte todo ¡maldita mi fe

Te escribo, no puedo decírtelo
Oh mamá, no
Me marcho, no quiero decirte

Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas, oh no
Cerca navega mi alma
Y donde miro encuentro lágrimas en ti
Piensa que vives dentro, mi corazón

Donde voy dicen que volver
Es posible con la pasión
De los que recordéis mi voz

Beatríz Luengo,"Preciosa, ahora que estamos los dos
Acompañando al silencio que vino a este encuentro 
Entre tu voz y mi voz

Quisiera no equivocar la ocasión
Busco palabras perfectas
Entre mi conciencia y lo que está en mi razón

Y cuanto más, y más, y más
Intento romper el hielo
Miro tus ojos frente a mí 
Brillando como un caramelo

Y quiero dejar de ser y estar
Y pido a Dios que se pare el tiempo
Entonces suspiras, te toco y muero

Sólo quiero mirarte y olvidar el pasado
Reducir el espacio entre tu piel y mis manos
No digas lo siento, no existe el lamento
Quiero todo, todo para mí

Te confieso que quise y no pude olvidarme
De tu dulce sonrisa y tus pequeños detalles
Llegado el momento, no existe lamento 
Y quiero todo, todo para mí

Propongo una tregua entre tú y yo
Dejemos atrás la batalla, colguemos las armas 
Y bandera blanca pa'l corazón, mira

Seguro que no saldrá bien la ecuación
Porque el amor no es perfecto
Y es que lo perfecto no le va a la pasión

Y cuanto más, y más, y más
Intento romper el hielo
Pierdo la gravedad y siento por segundos que me caigo al suelo

Acercarte, enséñame el ritmo de tu movimiento
Conviérteme suave en la mala del cuento
Y mátame lento, no te olvido por más que intento

Sueño 
Que tus latidos se confunden con los míos 
Que tus suspiros se parecieran mi sonido 
Que estás tan cerca que confundo tu voz con mi voz 

Y sueño 
Que eres el golpe de todos mis ritmos 
El diez de cada uno de los mitos 
Hay tanto espacio cuando tú no estás y te vas 

Y me refugio en la melancolía de tener tus besos 
Con que estés cerca me basta con eso 
No sé cómo asumir la soledad 

Y despierta, mi alma despierta 
Se ha dado cuenta que tenerte es mucho más que tener suerte 
Y llegas con la tormenta 
A demostrarme que sin duda, con tu paraguas bailaré

Lo estoy sintiendo, cada minuto más te llevo dentro 
Te juro que no puedo, estar un segundo sin ti 
Lo estoy sintiendo, cada minuto más te llevo dentro 
Te juro que no puedo, estar un segundo sin ti
A veces sueño 
Que eres el ruido en mis silencios 
El árbol donde duermen mis secretos 
En este mundo donde encuentro paz 
Si tú estás 

Y sueño 
Que eres la luz, un sol que no se paga 
Cuando te vas descubro que no hay nada 
Que basta solo una caricia y solo así, soy feliz 

Y me refugio en la melancolía de tener tus besos 
Con que estés cerca me basta con eso 
No sé cómo asumir la soledad 

Y despierta, mi alma despierta 
Solo cuento que tenerte, es mucho más que tener suerte 
Y llegas con la tormenta 
A demostrarme que sin duda, con tu paraguas bailaré

Porque un pájaro herido no puede volar
Porque caigo al vacío sin tu gravedad
Aunque ya los demás se hayan ido, no me dejes caer

Saca mi alma a correr aunque no deje huellas
Dime que puedo volar aunque me falten fuerzas

It's starting out to be just fine
I crack a smile but act unkind
Advertising bigger times

Feed my ego, watch it grow and grow
Get you off my tracks
If you hit the sack, let it swing back

From the mind to the record, from the soul to the throat
From the heart to the matter, from the head to the toes
I've been hanging on the edge, I've been waiting on a friend
Among the lost and found

Dash down to the bar to go insane
I'll drench this city with your name
Guess we hit the promised land
We were out but now we're in

Kiss me, squeeze me, bite me, strike me
Use me, soothe me, hold me tightly
Take me, break me, feel me, steal me
Tap me, wrap me and fly me to the moon

To weather the storm and set up the sun

Hail to the freaks, I can't get enough

Saw a friend recently
Beggin' for sympathy
Been holding my breath
And tryin' to accept
Another apology

Au fond à gauche tout près du bar

Pour boire aux yeux d’une nouvelle blonde
Ou pleurer celle qui était partie
Pour arranger le sort du monde
Et rêver tout haut dans la nuit

Se font des blagues et se taquinent
Sur les bébés ou les bedons

Et nous ressemble sous les lumières

On laisse couler les confidences
Et peu à peu on lève le voile
Sur les longues années de silence
Sur les amours et les batailles 
Sur la carrière et les caresses 
On se raconte nos trente ans 
Entre le rire et la tendresse

Si certains rêves se sont enfuis
En emportant dans leurs valises
Des mots d’amour jetés pêle-mêle 
Avec nos plus belles chemises
D’autres se sont glissés sans bruit 
Et nous ont laissé par surprise
Un œil ouvert sur la vraie vie
Et sur le monde autour de nous

Au fond à gauche tout près du bar
La même table où y a dix ans
Ils venaient s’asseoir tous les soirs

À composer des rimes pour ses vieux péchés

Vous l’écoutez parler

 Did you ever really keep it real when it counted
 I release myself and roll out
 Said ya'd never lie but ya sold out
 Before ya know it I'm gone
 With short notice 'cause I played them games way too long
 I'm movin on movin up movin out
 Sit and think about why you losin out

 Now I'm workin the club while you save the last dance
 Standin there wit' ya hand out

 Right to my face and it's supposed to be alright
 Well it's not and I've had enough
 Hit the whammy dog should've stopped pressin your luck

 That walk by so I dead it see the chalk line
 Hop on hers you off mine now if ya don't mind

How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart

Loved you night and day,

You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it

Never have drifted down a bayou stream

Beautiful Eulogy,"[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects of depravity like gang bangin' and earthquakes.
Most famous no namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of kings. I know it's a strange concept.
Pedalin' redemption boy what more can I say make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since ninety three.
Fillin' these 58′s with phrases that would deem us unfit to succeed among these heathens.
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible that you would understand that stage like your morning candle.
It's handin' out cancer that's why fame was never the aim and the back is the front – homie left side up!
That's a concept

Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losin' my cool...
It's what your frame of mind has chosen.
I'll leave your brain stimulated...

[Verse 2: Braille]
So many mis... conceptions- missin' the mark- mis-directed- drivin' reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions- our methods need corrections-
Spittin venom in their face and violate the ones we should protect it's an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused – view leadership as illegitimate so they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothin' more than a power-trip – they don't want to be plugged into it
They'd rather see that power stripped – get it? Power strip... It's unfortunate
Disproportionate the door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow left to our demise actin' foolish but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction of service and submission – within a leadership position

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right? Like your the type that believes that if you act right then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person, you followed the good book as much as you could, you probably didn't go to church as much as you should, but it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody, never really steal from anybody, you never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies.
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor, you try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval with the removal of sinful discretions – your righteous acts of removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception...

[Verse 4: Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection - and the greatest misconception the world believes the Christian is foolish without direction.
And they knock it they knock it but what does it profit a prophet to be socially ostracizing no we ain't stoppin' the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market for a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue in cheek, this is what I mean, they don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though. They just know the pseudo, the fake faith, the false one, the western God that's man made, not the Biblical Awesome

Beautiful Eulogy,"I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah
I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah

Whatever it is that gives that feeling that we can’t live without
The joys we try to get that only God can give we highly doubt
What allures and arouses the heart we can’t figure out
But it’s the quickest way to account for what we prize and are most proud about
These ""gods"" make promises but always lie to us
The kind of lies that says they’ll keep us safe and satisfy us
We blame the lies outside of us
But it’s the lie that lies inside that captures the depth of desires and false messiahs
We seek pleasure in anything, we overestimate everything
Endlessly trusting in empty entities
Secretly searching for anything in moments of blessing
While exiting edicts of Eden over our ecstasy
When a good God gives good gifts we generally tend to twist the list
And take the list of good gifts that God tends to give and make general ""gods"" out of gifts
I suppose what exposes the worship in most of us
Is a close look at most of our thoughts, fears, and emotions

No matter what I do
I can't ever make it last
I just repeat my past
I'm so broken
So much I thought I knew
All the things that I pursued
I'm worse off than before

I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah
I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah

The saddest fact is that I search for satisfaction
As if I lack it when in fact I lack nothing
That's the reason for my lackluster prayer life
And my lust for distractions, it's so easy to see in hindsight
I must confess it's the mess I acknowledge when I'm
Stalling on my responsibilities and don't apologize, but make excuses
Like my physical exhaustion is a license for narcissism
And speaking recklessly without caution
I often wonder, why I'm so awkward in conversations
Wishing I could switch places, envious of others
But my envy is a reflex of my ignorance
'Cause I don't know the details of their daily existence
I just assume the weight I carry is the heaviest
But I've never been a heavweight
My legs get heavy when I wait
Hope deferred so I prefer the immediate
And exchange the true God for what seems more expedient
It's meaningless

I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah
I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah

Help us not be haste when it comes to temporal blessings
And always see them for what they're actually meant to be
A mere extension of Your love and kindness
Extended to an undeserved humanity
Help us not see greater value in the gifts You give
And not become distracted from their intended desires
May we regard the world and all that is in it
As nothing compared to the satisfaction of knowing
Our Messiah",Messiah,2017

You apologize to me when I see you do a line, but like
I'm open-minded and it's fine

Beauty,"And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber. 
And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. 
And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own Midwest. 
And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. 
One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. 
And terror possessed me then. 
And I begged, ""Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"" 
And the angel said unto me, ""These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots! 
You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust.""

You were already getting nervous again. 
Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. 
Your head was almost empty.
 It always hurt you when you woke up like this. 
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, 
waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. 
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. 
""If God is our Father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin."" 
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? 
You got to your car and tried all the doors. 
They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. 
There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.

He'll come after them in the night
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall
I say we kill the beast!

We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action boys
It's time to fol-low-me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
'Till he's dead, good and dead kill the beast

No, I won't let you do this

If you're not with us, you're against
Bring the old man

Get your hands off me

We can't have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out

We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me

Get your torch, mount you horse

Through your courage to the stinking place

We're counting on your stud to lead the way
Through a mist to the wood, where we see a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast, just as tall as a mountain,
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased
Steady fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow
Let's get on and here we go

We'll lay siege to the castle, and bring back his head

We have to warn the beast this is all my fault
OH papa what are we going to do

Now, now
We'll think of something

We don't like what we don't
Understand and in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save children and and your wives
So save our village and our lives
Lets kill the beast

I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all

Could it be
Is it she
Scara bleu! Invaders
Encroachers
And they 'ave the mirror
Warn the master If it's a fight they want
We'll be ready for them Who's with me! Arrgh

Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The beast is mine

Find a place, stand aside, we go marching into battle
Unafraid of all the things you just decreed

Raise the ram, sing this song
Here we come at fifty strong
If fifty Frenchmen can be wrong
Let's kill the beast

Pardon me, Master
Leave me in peace
But sir! The castle is under attack

Oh Lumiere, we must do something

He'll come after them in the night
We're not safe 'till his head is mounted on my wall
I say we kill the beast!

We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action boys
It's time to fol-low-me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside

It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feed
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
'Till he's dead, good and dead kill the beast

No, I won't let you do this

If you're not with us, you're against
Bring the old man

Get your hands off me

We can't have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out

We'll rid the village of this beast, who's with me

Get your torch, mount you horse

Through your courage to the stinking place

We're counting on your stud to lead the way
Through a mist to the wood, where we see a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast, just as tall as a mountain,
We won't rest 'till he's good and deceased
Steady fourth, tally ho! Grab your sword, grab your bow
Let's get on and here we go

We'll lay siege to the castle, and bring back his head

We have to warn the beast this is all my fault
OH papa what are we going to do

Now, now
We'll think of something

We don't like what we don't
Understand and in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save children and and your wives
So save our village and our lives
Lets kill the beast

I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all

Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The beast is mine

Find a place, stand aside, we go marching into battle
Unafraid of all the things you just decreed

Here we come at fifty strong

Let's kill the beast

Pardon me, Master
Leave me in peace

Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow

Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave

Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind

In a black tie and straight jacket
Man I'm gonna try again

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Never mind the tree

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays they only die

There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break

And strung out just the same

Hoy le gusta su sonrisa, no se siente una extraña
Hoy sueña lo que quiere sin preocuparse por nada
Hoy es una mujer que se da cuenta de su alma

Que nadie puede hacerte daño, nadie puede hacerte daño
Hoy vas a comprender 
Que el miedo se puede romper con un solo portazo

Ha roto sin pudores las reglas marcadas

Comiendo el tiempo por tus venas
Y tu inseguridad machista se refleja

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Sino que pase y se pierdan los recuerdos.

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel!

Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Sing praises to our heavenly Lord

Can someone tell me this is real
Or can this end up like before

There's no mistake this time I'm sure

And if you say I can
Then I know I will
If you say you love me
Then its so

Waited here beside my tears

Seen in me things I would never have seen
I don't understand why you care so much, it's all a mystery
Time and time again I ask myself
What have I done to deserve such wealth
The price you paid, I could never repay your generosity

In wanting to save me
In order to save the day
Because of love you placed yourself
In harm's way
It's truly beyond me
Left without a word to say
What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way?
What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way?

When I was down you came and lifted me
When I was bound, yes, you set me free
Things that you do makes it clear to see
It's all a master plan
Oh, no greater love that I've come to know
And when I refuse, you still love me so
With open arms you came and rescued me
And erased all the pain, yes all the pain

What kind of love would place itself
In harm's way?

What kind of love would place itself
And risk your life for love's sake?
What kind of love just takes on all the blame?
It seems to be so easy
It hurts sometimes but you never let go
You will to love in spite of all you know
You know, you know

I'm reminded of a time in my life 
When all the dark clouds hung over me 
I was lost inside in search of a key 

I remember loved ones being so kind 
Saying things would get much better with time 
And I admit sometimes they did for a while 
And then I'd find myself back under the cloud

Right in the midst of the rain 
My heart was so full of pain 
You came and rescued my soul 
And then your love took control 
Right in the midst of the rain 
You caused me to smile again 
My life was awesomely changed 
Right in the midst of the rain 

When it comes right down to just you and me 
There's nothing better now these eyes can see 
And tell me what compares to all you are 
You are everything, yes my morning star 

My mind my heart and soul said I now give to you 
I'm under your command so what can I do? 
Cause I surrender all, all that I owe 
And will follow wherever you go

I can remember...

You came and knocked at my door
With words I heard once before
Just who you are is still unclear
Knowing one day you will leave
To my surprise and relief
Love was the reason you came here

This song I sing is no fairy tale
It's full of truth and it's real
I've made bad choices, I've made mistakes

ItÂ´s  funny how we Ive seen,

ItÂ´s a part of destiny.
Some wish upon a star and hopes one day that wish comes true,
But I wouldnÂ´t change one simple thing the chance of loving You!

Born for this, destined for greatness,
I was prepared for this;
Your Strength for my weakness,
I found that loving someone is easy 
And learned with love that comes a risk
And in my quest to find the answer,
Found I was born for this.

What we donÂ´t  know, time will tell.
This I do believe;
When a child is born the angels sing 
In perfect harmony
That doesnÂ´t  means just happiness, 
ThereÂ´s  always room for rain.
But if we learn, what Autumn knows, 
That Spring will come again!

[Chorus]

ThereÂ´s a time to live and a time to die
So letÂ´s celebrate each moment of our life.
And if we ever lose our way, because the heart is torn
Never let it question whyÂ´s  the reason that weÂ´re born.

Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;

Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;

We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered;
Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last

His day is marching on.

Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""

Fura o dedo, faz um pacto comigo

After all, all I have in my mind
Is just silence all around
A thousand times I have tried to find
Pieces of dreams. visions and sounds
And then I pray for better days

Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone?
Don't let it go
Never forget that when
I think of you
You're not alone

After all, all I have in my heart
Are the pieces, that I found
Shades of blue, swimming in the moon
Counting the stars all around

If I could name
A fruit for you
It would be jabuticaba
Blue, black and small
On the outside
And soft and sweet within

My favourite memory
Was under that tree
That's been there since
I was three
Now I would like to
Sing for you
My jabuticaba song

Isn't she lovely
Like purple rain
Walking on sunshine with you
(over the rainbow)
Quiet nights, quiet stars
It's summertime
Quiet nights, quiet stars and you

If I could name
A tree for you
It would be
Jabuticaba
Under the shade
Of the cool green leaves
It all comes back to me

So when that taste
Reminds you
You know just where
To find me
And now I would like to sing for you
My jabuticaba song

There was just nowhere to go
Cause standing tall on every side,
The mighty fear of letting go
She said, my God I'm so ashamed,
Thirty years a tragedy
I still believed that he could change,
But he pulled me down like gravity

He broke my will, but it's deeper still, deeper still

She told me morning was the time,
When the sun burned bright and clean
And love grew fragile on the vine,
All wrapped up in gold and green
Cause after all we know we all
Are after all the same things
But for the sun no rain would fall,
And it burned him up and turned him mean

This fire that kills me, it's deeper still, deeper still

Tonight I rose up with the moon,
And looking down from high above
I saw a world carved and confused
Into valleys deep in need of love
And falling down all thick with grace,
Heaven's cloud of mystery
Was filling every empty space,
Down to the depth of human need

This love that heals, it's deeper still
(Love that heals me, love that heals me,
Love that's deeper still)

Making me look up from my precious world 
Forcing me to see your point of view 

This broken sidewalk, not so broken as 
The man who likes to walk, jumping all the cracks 
Pushing his old bike, he's sure to smile at you 

I was looking for the quick way home 
But you were happy just to be alone 
Something magic must have caught my eye 
I saw the secret of the man inside 
I saw the secret of the man inside 

It's not the sun-baked brick lines in your skin 
Thick with chain grease, aged and clumsy hands 
It isn't struggled words you fight to say 

Beneath the man-suit, beneath your purple skin 
There is a boy who don't know that he's a man 
He simply close his eyes and he can fly away 

I was driving in the same old car 
But you were dreaming of a land so far away 
I was looking through my corner eye 
But you were singing with the man inside 
You were singing with the man inside 

Some think they got a lot to offer 
some think they got a lot to give 
Those people think they own this world 
But some people know to truly live",The Man Inside,1999
Bebo Norman,"A page is turned by the wind to a boy in curly grin 
With a world to conquer at the age of ten 
But as history unfolds and the storybook is told 
He finds salvation but not at the hands of man 

And the God of second chance 
Picked him up and He let him dance 
Through a world that is not kind 
And all this time, preparing him, the one 
To hold him up when he comes undone 
Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
And now a man, here you stand 
Your day has come 

A page is turned in this world to reveal a little girl 
With a heart that's bigger, as it is unfurled 
By the language in her soul, that's teaching her to grow 
With a careful cover of love that will not fail 

And the God of second chance 
Picked her up and He let her dance 
Through a world that isn't kind 
And all this time, preparing her the one 
To hold her up when she comes undone 
Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
And grown up tall, here you are 
Your day has come 

Beneath the air of autumn, she took him by his hand 
And warm within the ardor, she took his heart instead 
And high upon the mountain, he asked her for her hand 
Just for her hand 

A page is turned in this life, he's making her his wife 
And there is no secret to the source of this much life 
When the grace that falls like rain is washing them again 
Just a chance to somehow rise above this land 

Where the God of second chance 
Will pick them up and he'll let them dance 
Through a world that is not kind 
And all this time, they're sharing with the one 
That holds them up when they come undone 
Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
And once again, here you stand 
And once again, here you stand 
Your day has come",A Page Is Turned,1999
Bebo Norman,"Lay down softly in our sorrow
Lay down sister to die
And cover over, my sweet Father
Cover over her eyes

Your broken body, it cannot weather
The years your youth still longs to spend
So go down graceful, sleep with the angels
And wake up whole again

'Cause it was not your time; that's a useless line
A fallen world took your life

But the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down, sister, lay down

Slower passing are the hours
To tell this tale that takes its time
But the finest moment, no man can measure
Is to look your Savior in the eyes

So take her tender to Your table
Take her from this killing floor
To taste the water that is forever
Let her be thirsty no more

It was not her time; that's a useless line
A fallen world took her life

But the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down, sister, lay down

And the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down, Rita, lay down



",Rita,1999
Bebo Norman,"The time is ours, your open arms
These frozen fields, all here at Selwood Farm
This swollen love reminds me of
Your spilling soul that somehow always fills me up

Every word is true
Gathered hearts are here just to sing their soul to you
And every word is true
I'm happy when I'm here with you, oh with you
At Selwood Farm

I see the sisters smiling
I see the light upon their face
Here is the promise that fills this place
There is an edge of winter
But there is fire that keeps us warm
This is the harvest at Selwood Farm

Every word is true
Gathered hearts are here just to sing their soul to you
And every word is true
I'm happy when I'm here with you, oh with you
At Selwood Farm

And these are the sons and daughters
They turn in the leaves then come inside
I welcome the healing of all my pride
And this is a day worth keeping
This is a day worth dwelling on
This is the day at Selwood Farm

And I don't know why, but my heart just smiles
And I know that each day we're growing older
But I still know the way
So take me to the day
Take me to the day

",Selwood Farm,1999
Bebo Norman,"I'm walking in an open field 
Looking for some space to fill 
I believe there's something left to hold 
So even when the sun goes down 
And there's no one around 
I'm standing in the freedom of my soul 

And the truth of the matter is still the same 
It's that you and I, we will not be here forever 
The truth of the matter is still the same 

I'm ready to stand 
I'm ready to stand 
I'm ready to stand 
I'm ready to stand 

I can see the earth from here, 
I can see it shake in fear 
I can see it falling to its knees 
But you know I'm not the same, 
My burden is a burning flame 
I hold it up for all the world to see 

I'm walking in an open field, 
Looking for some space to fill 
I believe there's something left to hold

Standing high upon this mountain
I've seen your face 
Full of the light that holiest height can show
Blessed hand is why you you've given
But you've been given all you'll ever need
To know

[Chorus]
So walk down this mountain
With your heart held high
Follow in the footsteps of your maker
With this love that's gone before you 
And these people at your side
If you offer up your broken cup
You will taste the meaning of this life
Hey hey

Well it's a common ground
And I see you're all still standing
But just look around and you'll find 
The very face of God
He's walking down into the distance
He's walking down to where the masses are

We're standing in a place of peace
And this is how the world should be

Bebo Norman,"I don't know why I always run 
Is it fear of the fall or fear of the touch 
And I don't know where the angels sleep 

And I don't know how to really love 
I've never stood still long enough 
And I don't know where the angels sleep 

But I am alive and standing strong 
I'm no farther forward, just farther along 
I hold on to my pride and dig in deep 
It's pulling me down, and I am no closer to release 
And I don't know where the angels sleep 

I don't know how to see you now 
The friend from before is different somehow 
And I don't know where the angels sleep 

And I don't know when I'll love again 
But I don't trust myself to just let you in 
And I don't know where the angels sleep 

It's taken ten thousand days 
To get stuck in my ways 
And it offers no grace 
I cannot stand this place

No, I don't know where the angels sleep",Where the Angels Sleep,1999
Bebo Norman,"I believe when they put her in the ground
I think they buried part of me
Because I've been searching, I've been looking all around
But I cannot find the heart of me, the heart of me

So I'll put my fingers in this soil upon her grave
And I will plant for her a garden
And every flower, a reminder of her face
Will grow up graceful as a pardon

And all that grows is her story told
As life unfolds here before us
The peace I've found in this broken ground
I can see her in the harvest...of all that I have sown

Long before I was covered up in gray
Before the old had bent my bones
We grew our children in the red Georgia clay
They were our garden and our home

And all that grows is our story told
As life unfolds here before
The peace we found in that broken ground
I can see them in the harvest...of all that I have sown

And when my life is done
I pray the kingdom come
And take me to Glory
It's living inside me
It was planted like a seed
All to tell a story

I believe when they put me in the ground
There will remain a part of me
Because I've been seraching and the joy that I have found
Is living in my family...it's all that I have sown

Shows me all that I have got

To be everything I'm not

I breathe deep the breath of God 

I cannot find another sky

Passion lives another day 
And I will dream of tomorrow 
Where perhaps she'll wait for me

Would you find no words to say 
Would you steal my heart away

And the long road 
And the breath that blows 
Across the water 
We've seen the last line

But these friends of mine 
Are sons and daughters

We found a home

And the falling rain washed us clean 
And healed our souls

I saw a preacher man 
He had heaven in his hand 
on satellite TV 
And he'll fix your sorry life 
And then he'll fix the price 
Because Heaven sure is nice 
But salvation isn't free 
And now could it be instead 
That we've lost our innocence 
But one day this pain will end 
Hope is coming back again 
And we can live forever 

Well I have heard it said 
That maybe God is dead

In the tapestry of time 
I cannot imagine where 
I could find someone as kind

That you would always hold my heart

You make the mornings seem so light 
With coffee in the air 
But to be a mother and a wife

My love is deeper than the darkness of my soul 
And my love has the habit of forgetting to let go 

And the crowd was pressing in
Like perfect strangers 
That was the day I felt 
Her hand slip out of mine 
She looked at me and 
I don't think she even wavered 
As she waved goodbye
She did not cry
But she waved goodbye

My love, why did you take my heart and run 
My love, can't you see that we had just begun",My Love,2002
Bebo Norman,"Feels like a brand new day

And I need you

To walk away 

Your love won't bring me down 

I'm living a long, long life 
And I will not let you go 
It's taken a long, long time to get here 
It could be a long, long night 
But I will not let you go 
Love will be our mystery 

So let's leave this world behind 
And see what we can find 

Cause I don't need it 
Or believe it

Looking for a savior, looking for a home

So don't leave me here alone
Don't leave me here alone

Under my skin, I'm shaking
And I can't get out

So don't leave me here

This is not what you said
It's all in my head 
When I throw my anger at you instead
So don't give up on me

That you'll never leave me

But I am so afraid 
That I'll find myself alone
Lookin for a savior, lookin for a home
I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Deep into the ages, deep into the foam

Over everything under the sun

That will leave no choice 
It will come to call us home

One day everything will cry out

And through my window pane 
The scenery flies by and disappears

Until I am home again, where the trees stand still 

Yesterday it seems 
I traveled in a younger man's clothes 
Living out this dream 
And wandering through fields of touch and go 
Moving on forever 
Watching the distance fade away 
But now I just want to land, where the trees stand still 

All this time 
On this line 
Here then I am gone 

Tonight I want a life 
Where the faces are the same most every day 
Tonight I want a wife 
To sit with me and watch our children play 
All the world between us

And when the laughing's done, we'll watch the trees stand still

We will make a home, where the trees stand still",Where the Trees Stand Still,2002

Right out of me
I know of only one place I can run to?

Crashing like a raindrop

Shaking like a leaf?

Steady as an earthquake
Can you hear my heart break
Tearing at the seems?

I am drifting in my deep end

You hold me together

Oh Lord, you carried me 

And just like a soldier 
You battle for my soul

You come and take me home

With a heart of his own 
And every day goes in and out, still without a sign of life 
But father won't you please give me more 
When everything is closing in on me

All weary from the race 
And the voices in my head 
You stepped inside and changed my will 

Oh me, oh my 
I am standing in your silence 
Gonna stand here for a long, long time 

Well, it's cold behind the earth 
For a drifting satellite 
But you know for what its worth

And if I am fields of green 
Well, honey you're the sun

Singin' if I was gone, I'd be gone for good 
I'm afraid to grow up 
But somewhere inside is the will of a man 
And all I've ever wanted 
Was something to give and love if I can

You make me want to fight 
You make me want to live 
You make me want to give 

And inside my room looking out 
The colors of night all faded and bruised 
But out from the shadows of doubt 
You held up your heart and stepped into view 
And under the streetlight we kissed 
Never more tried and never more true 
It drew a new song from my lips 
Singing if I can fall, I'm falling for you 
I'm afraid to grow up

That I might live, that I might live!

God, my God, I cry out

Your beloved needs You now

God, be near calm my fear and take my doubt

Your kindness is what pulls me up

Your love is all that draws me in

of the mountains I can't climb

I will lift my eyes to the Calmer

of the oceans raging wild

I will lift my eyes to the Healer

of the hurt I hold inside

I will lift my eyes, lift my eyes to You


God, my God, let mercy sing

her melody over me

and God, right here all I bring

is all of me

Your kindness is what pulls me up

Your love is all that draws me in

of the mountains I can't climb

I will lift my eyes to the Calmer

of the oceans raging wild

I will lift my eyes to the Healer

Perfect in glory, broken by the story
Of untold grace, come that day

Majesty had come down, glory had succumbed now
To flesh and bone
In the arms of a manger, in the hands of strangers
That could not know, just who they hold

And the angels filled the sky
All of heaven wondered why
Why their King would choose to be
Be a baby born to die

And all fell silent for the cry of an infant
The voice of God
Was dividing history for those with eyes to see
The Son would shine from earth that night

And the angels filled the sky
All of heaven wondered why
Why their King would choose to be
Be a baby born to die, be a baby born to die

To break the chains of guilt and sin
To find us here, to pull us in
So we can join in heaven's song
And with one voice around the throne

Be a baby born to die

Bebo Norman,"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling like Christmas

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kid's bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all
The bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

It's all been said before, but I'll say it again

With nothing to give, nothing to give

'Cause I know that You want me to
It's all been said before, but I'll say it again
'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me

Than the songs of angels and gifts of kings
More beautiful to You
Are what empty hands can bring
And what desperate tongues can sing
And when broken hearts cling to You

Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío
Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida
Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío
Tiene lágrimas negras
Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida

Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono
Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones
En vez de maldecirte con justo encono
En mis sueños te colmo
En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones

Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío
Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida
Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío
Tiene lágrimas negras
Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida

Viendo el guadalquivir
Las gitanas lavan, los ninõs en la orilla
Veindo los barcos pasar
Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero
Si te acaricio la cara
Tienes que darme un beso

En el guadalquivir, mi gitana lavaba
Pañuelo de blanco y oro
Que yo te daba, que yo te daba
Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero
Si te acaricio la cara
Tienes que darme un beso

Tú me quieres dejar
Yo no quiero sufrir
Contigo me voy gitana
Aunque me cueste morir
Contigo me voy gitana
Aunque me cueste morir",Lágrimas Negras,2004
Bebo Valdés,"Turbio fondeadero donde van a recalar
Barcos que en el muelle para siempre han de quedar
Sombras que se alargan en la noche del dolor
Náufragos del mundo que han perdido el corazón

Puentes y cordajes donde el viento viene a aullar
Barcos carboneros que jamás han de zarpar
Sordo cementerio de las naves que al morir
Sueñan sin embargo que hacia el mar han de partir

Niebla del riachuelo
Amarrado al recuerdo te sigo esperando
Niebla del riachuelo
De ese amor para siempre me vas alejando

Nunca más volvió, nunca más la vi
Nunca más su amor, nombró mi nombre junto a mí
Esa misma voz que dijo adiós

Mucho fuiste para mí
Siempre te llamé mi encanto
Siempre te llamé mi vida
Hoy tu nombre se me olvida

Se me olvidó que te olvidé
Se me olvidó que te dejé
Lejos muy lejos de mi vida
Se me olvidó que ya no estás
Que ya ni me recordarás
Y me volvió a sangrar la herida

Se me olvidó que te olvidé

Bebo Valdés,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2004
Bebo Valdés,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2004
Bebo Valdés,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2004
Bebo Valdés,"Your green eyes with their soft lights,
Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

Green eyes with their soft lights
And eyes that promise sweet nights
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts too, with a thrill so sublime.

Those cool and limpi green eyes
A pool where in my love lies
So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me.
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, I love you.

Bebo Valdés,"Eres mi bien lo que me tiene extasiado
¿Por qué negar que estoy de ti enamorado?
De tu dulce alma que es todo sentimiento

De esos ojazos negros de un raro fulgor
Que me dominan e incitan al amor
Eres un encanto, eres mi ilusión

No necesito ir al cielo si tú

Bebo Valdés,"Se fue tras una última noche fugaz
Y un amanecer absurdo pero elegante
Aquella tarde de luz, sus besos hicieron diana 
Justo aquí en mi corazón dormido y errante 
Recuerdo de otro amanecer 
Lindo y estúpido

Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Qué es lo que ha pasado
Hoy yo me pregunto cómo era
Yo ya no recuerdo cómo era 
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Ya no tengo ni un recuerdo de lo que he sido 
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió

Esos bombillos de bar que fingiendo 
Ser luna de abril, iluminas mi penar
Mi penar triste y hermoso ilumina también 
El camino lento hacia una nueva luna
Que ando yo superviviente de un amor casi imposible

Arrepentida de otro amor casi impecable
De nuevo al frente de este amor casi imposible

Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Y ahora me pregunto qué debo hacer conmigo
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Yo ya no tengo ni un recuerdo de lo que he sido
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió

Bebop & Destruction,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003
Beborn Beton,"On fridays we usually went for a walk
Tasting dew dripping down from the fruits as we paused, 
Sweet as honey the dew even sweeter were you 
Back then I could have sworn you're the one

On the way we would cross our bridge made of half rotten wood 
And you'd tighten you grip in your eyes something blue's, 
Begging me to be true, and I promise to stand and be strong

Should I cry for you 
My love died with you 
One fine day I will follow elaine

As we set in the shadows and talked 
I heard some kind of noise interfering and lowered my voice 
Hooded men drew their sword for to use them of course 
Took our property, left us in pain

Left me heavily wounded and killed my ellaine 
Stabbed her into the heart that she kept for my reign 
Vengeance will be mine 
Til the end of all time 
I'll be after the men that have killed my ellaine",Elaine,1997
Beborn Beton,"You take my nerves, you bring me sorrow
I reach out for a hatchet seeking entry
Your time is running out, there's no excuse

And after all you smile
You try in making fun of me
You're simply irresistible
The colour of your hair is the colour of love

Make me believe that
It all lies in our hands
And when you close your eyes for me
I seem to understand

I must admit I miss your smile
But all that lingers on is in my head
All that's left of you, memories

So I descend - le souterrain
And I tear down the wall that hides my love
You are still beautiful
The colour of your hair is the colour of love

Make me believe that
It all lies in our hands
And when you close your eyes for me
I seem to understand",The Colour of Love,1997
Beborn Beton,"The street's running under our feet
Worlds between us, although you're near me

The cold came creeping in the night
And this rain weakens my brain 

Hate is the kiss when you awake
A vision of a red, red rose

So the clown starts his last song
While a light end the sun 

Now we're 200 miles away from the sea
And I'm standing in the doorway

Your eyes are lying at me still
And then you slowly shut the door 

The smell of death is hanging in the air
And I see little children burning

While it rains dead cats and dogs
I look to the sky - where's a god? 

Can't you see it's torture for me
And this is why I hate you now,
All I want is to forget you
I can live without you now!

Beborn Beton,"Listen to the voice of Buddha
Saying stop your seri-culture
Little people like your offspring
Boiled alive for some gods stocking
Buddha's watching, Buddha's waiting
Just because the kid's an orphan
Is no excuse for thoughtless slaying
People don't forget this torture
Just because you call her mother
Doesn't mean that she's your better

Who cares for the little children
You may slice with no conviction
Blind revenge on a blameless victim

Bebossa,"Dia de luz, festa de sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
No macio azul do mar

Tudo é verão, o amor se faz
No barquinho pelo mar
Que desliza sem parar
Sem intenção, nossa canção

Vai saindo desse mar
E o sol
Beija o barco e luz
Dias tão azuis

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

Céu tão azul, ilhas do sul
E o barquinho, coração
Deslizando na canção

Tudo isso é paz
Tudo isso traz
Uma calma de verão
E então
O barquinho vai
E a tardinha cai

Sorrio pro meu Rio 
Que tem no seu mar
Lindas flores que nascem morenas
Em jardins de sol

Rio, serras de veludo
Sorrio pro meu Rio
Que sorri de tudo
Que é dourado quase todo dia
E alegre como a luz

Rio é mar, eterno se fazer amar
O meu Rio é lua
Amiga branca e nua
É sol, é sal, é sul
São mãos se descobrindo em todo azul
Por isso é que meu Rio da mulher beleza
Acaba num instante com qualquer tristeza
Meu Rio que não dorme porque não se cansa
Meu Rio que balança

Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
