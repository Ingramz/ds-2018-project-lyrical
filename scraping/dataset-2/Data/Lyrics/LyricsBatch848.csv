Phil Urso,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,1955
Phil Urso,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1955
Phil Vassar,"I was lousy at math, a failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarterback in the back of the class
She was the whiz kid in the horned-rimmed glasses
It'd been a long time since I'd been around
Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old schoolyard
And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says
?I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever?
It took a second to put it all together, I said

Oo-la-la-la-la-la lookin' good Carlene
Oh-my-my-my-my-my time's been good to you
If you know what I mean, girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good God Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

She said, ?Hop in, let's go for a spin
Tell me what you been doing boy, and where you been?
I said, ?I write songs, you probably didn't know
I finally got a couple on country radio?
She said, ?What a switch, ain't it funny
I've got a PHD., Now I'm modeling for money
Imagine little miss four point o
Smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue?
I said, ?You've come long way since graduation
Let me say without reservation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations?

Oo-la-la-la-la-la lookin' good Carlene
Oh-my-my-my-my-my time's been good to you
If you know what I mean, girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good God Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

I said, ?I hope to see you again someday?
She said, ?Another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my Mama's at eight,? I said

Oo-la-la-la-la-la lookin' good Carlene
Oh-my-my-my-my-my time's been good to you
If you know what I mean, girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good God Carlene, you sure are lookin' good",Carlene,2000
Phil Vassar,"Said the cloud to the sun, ""Today's no time to shine""
Didn't you know she's gone
Said the rain to the moon, ""You're not needed tonight""
Didn't you know she's gone
You can keep your magical moments we don't need'em 'round here

Didn't you know she's gone by now
I thought you'd have figured it out
Can't you please forget her and just move on
Didn't you know she's gone

Said the tear to the pillow, ""Watch out I'm ready to fall""
Didn't you know she's gone
Said the pillow to the tear, ""That ain't gonna help at all""
Didn't you know she's gone
""Why do you insist upon crying, what's the matter with you""

Didn't you know she's gone by now
I thought you'd have figured it out
Can't you please forget her and just move on
Didn't you know she's gone

Said myself to me, ""Hey man why can't you see
She's history, she's gone and she ain't comin' back""

Said the mirror to the man, ""Take a good look at yourself""
Didn't you know she's gone
Said the man to the mirror a few choice words to myself
Didn't you know she's gone
Talk about a revelation, right between the eyes

Didn't you know she's gone by now
I thought you'd have figured it out
Can't you please forget her and just move on
Didn't you know she's gone

Didn't you know she's gone by now
I thought you'd have figured it out
Can't you please forget her and just move on
Didn't you know she's gone",Didn't You Know She's Gone,2000
Phil Vassar,"Things are too simple, things are too hard
Nobody's happy with the way things are
Looking for the quick fix, the short term loan
Got to rent ?cause you might not be here long enough to own
The way I see it the trouble with the world these days
It's getting way too easy just to drive away

With you and me baby it's up and down
We're moving the earth or we're on shaky ground
We talk about forever when it's all going smooth
Or moving out tomorrow if things don't improve
Well the way I see it the trouble with love these days
It's gotten way too easy just to drive away

And you can drive away
If you've got half a mind to and half a tank you can
Drive away
First sign of trouble first little thing goes wrong
You can climb in your car and drive till you're gone

Whatever we've got it's worth the risk
To read a little promise into every kiss
You pay for the music but you do get to dance
When you love somebody it's not that big a chance
The way I see it we've got every reason to stay
And every reason to go together if we drive away

And we can drive away
If we need to start again, that's ok, we can
Drive away
Till we find that place where we can live on faith
That we'll never again have to drive away
",Drive Away,2000
Phil Vassar,"Joe and rosalita, look'em up in the year book
Even then they had that wild-in-love crazy look
Joe's car on friday night, after the ball game
Steam so thick on the windows
They could write their names
They'd fight like cats and dogs outside of homeroom
See'em hangin' all over each other that same afternoon

Joe and rosalita
Ball-cap, good-ole boy and brown-eyed senorita
Rocked this town like no one's ever done
'round here they're known as the legends of love

Old mr.rosenbaum kicked'em out of the senior prom
Busted for dirty dancin'
Sent him home and he called her mom
Pulled the old pillow trick, and they both snuck out
Showed up two days later still in a tux and a prom gown
Got married on the steps outside the courthouse
Called it the great escape, people still talk about it now

Joe and rosalita
Ball-cap, good-ole boy and brown-eyed senorita
Rocked this town like no one's ever done
'round here they're known as the legends of love

Rosalita is still a rose
Now it's been 10 years for rose and joe
Now sometimes you see'em cruisin' down main street
Still got his arm around her, two kids in the backseat
They book a babysitter to go out on friday
Sometimes they never even make it out of the driveway

Joe and rosalita

Phil Vassar,"The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills, overdue
Good morning baby, how are you?
Got a half hour, quick shower
Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back
There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it.
I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's ok. It's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Friday, you're late
Guess we'll never make our dinner date
At the restaurant you start to cry
Baby, we'll just improvise
Well, plan be	 looks like
Dominoes' pizza in the candle light
Then we'll tippy toe to our room
Make a little love that's overdue
But somebody had a bad dream
Mama and daddy
Can meand my teddy
Come in to sleep in between?

Yeah it's ok. It's so nice.
It's just another day in paradise.
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

And I ask the lord every night
For just another day in paradise

For just another day in paradise
Well, it's the kids screaming. The phone ringing
Just another day
Well, it's Friday. You're late
Oh yeah, it's just another day in paradise",Just Another Day in Paradise,2000
Phil Vassar,"I guess I gave myself to someone
Maybe a time or two I tried
I went through the motions
What was I supposed to do?
I spun my wheels; I wasted so much time
And then with you I finally got it right

[Chorus]
It's like I never loved before
Like I never saw the sun
Or felt the rainfall on my face
It's like it's never, ever been
I can't imagine life without you anymore
It feels just like I never loved before

I never talked about forever
Now it's not long enough
Who's that guy lookin' in the mirror?
'Cause it's not the man I was
I only know I tremble when we kiss
I'm making up for everything I missed

[Chorus]

I ran around in circles
I never knew
I was only getting ready for you

[Chorus]",Like I Never Loved Before,2000
Phil Vassar,"Ain't got a BMW
I've got a truck note overdue
I ain't a millionaire it's true
But I got it all when I got you
The rich man's got nothin' on me
No there ain't anybody

As lucky as me, I got a four leaf clover
Got an angel over my shoulder
I wake up laughin', yeah life is but a dream
I can't even believe
I'm lucky as me, oh baby I can't lose
I'm on a roll and I owe it all to you
I thank my stars for your love so sweet
Everybody should be lucky as me

Ain't got the finer things and such
Guess all I've got's the Midas touch
Ain't got a lot but you could say
I hit the jackpot everyday
Long as you're standin' by me
Girl there ain't anybody

As lucky as me, I got a four leaf clover
Got an angel over my shoulder
I wake up laughin', yeah life is but a dream

Phil Vassar,"We were somethin', you and me
Yeah, we had ?em rollin in the aisles
We got it right once, didn't we
We had our shot and missed it by a mile

Forget the bitter end
Can you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time

But how sweet it was back then
Do you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet
",Rose Bouquet,2000
Phil Vassar,"Winter sure was cold and miserable
Cooped up, shut down; baby, it was pitiful
Anyhow, it's over now
We owe to ourselves to have a little fun
The pace car's pacin'; now the green flag's wavin'

[Chorus]
Uh oh, another six-pack summer comin'
Sing to me, babe; I'll be your dashboard drummer, and
Let's turn the radio up as loud it can go
Got the ultra-ray wraparound sunglass vision
Got the sails up, iced down a cool ambition
Just to relax and let the six-pack summer roll

We've got the sun block, a blanket, and the best of Jimmy Buffet
T-bones for the grill; hey, ain't it great to rough it?
The party's on from dawn til dawn
Twenty-four-seven till they pull the plug
No more waitin'; come on and kiss me, baby

Slow and steady, I'm so ready
Uh oh, another six-pack summer

[Chorus]",Six-Pack Summer,2000
Phil Vassar,"Sometimes I forget, then I remember
Sometimes I hold on, then I let go
Sometimes I fight, then I surrender
Losing you's been harder than you'll ever know
I'm just caught here, halfway there
I'm hangin' in mid-air

[Chorus]
Somewhere in between, in the middle
Of the darkness and the light
All I can see is the hazy gray
Between the black and white
I'm not laughin', I'm not cryin'
I'm not livin', I'm not dyin', I'm not flyin'
And I'm not down on my knees
Until I'm over you I'm gonna be stuck
Somewhere in between

The funny thing about your memory
Is how it takes me by surprise
How suddenly it sneaks up on me
Comes around and cuts me down to size
There's a crossroad up ahead
I'm just not there yet, I'm...

[Chorus]

I'm just not there yet, I'm...

[Chorus]

Somewhere in between",Somewhere in Between,2000
Phil Vassar,"When I hear you stop and laugh out loud
When you're fallin' fast asleep
When you're in the middle of a crowd
When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
?cause you already know
When you smile that way
I know, every night and every day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know, without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Every day I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you

Phil Vassar,"I was ten I was thin I was playing first base
With a second hand glove and dirt on my face
In nowhere Virginia who'd ever figure
That kid in the yard would go very far

'Cause 419 Lakewood had no silver spoons
Just an old beat up upright that played out of tune
Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings I thank god I was

An American child
An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild
Born inside an American child

7 lbs. 3 oz she's got my nose
And she's into my heart as deep as it goes
With a promise that's more than just someone's last name
Anyone's equal, in late August came

If you're headin' south on
Georgia one twenty-nine
Straight into Athens past the Clark County line
There's an old Texaco right across
From the Athens Woolworth
Billy Joe Taylor's underneath that lift
There ain't a car on the planet that he can't fix
He swears on his chrome-plated ratchet
That his heaven on earth

Well, he can make a rusty muffler purr like a kitten
Or an old Nash Rambler top out at one-fifty
Georgia's never seen a man more at peace
Than when Billy's got his hands in 
Athen's Grease

Six days a week, he's a man on a mission
He's the redneck Picasso of 
The manual transmission
And the only man in town who can make 
Charlie Vincent's van go
When the sun goes down
And the day is endin'
Billy's still rockin' with a rack and pinion
Long as that boy's at work, well he's right at home

Well, he can make a rusty muffler purr like a kitten
Or an old Nash Rambler top out at one-fifty
Georgia's never seen a man more at peace
Than when Billy's got his hands in 
Athen's Grease

Well, he's a rotatin,' lug nuttin,'
Spark pluggin' good ole boy

And Thelma Lou Taylor likes to hang out at the station
'Cause she loves to watch him work

Phil Vassar,"Well maybe lately I've been acting a little bit strange
And maybe there's a few things
I need to explain
So what if I call you at work for now reason
And I sent you those flowers today
So what if my friends tell me 
They never see me
And everyone's sayin' I've changed

If you think I always think about you
And I dream about you day and night
If you think for a moment I can't live without you
And maybe I've fallen in love with you

Baby, you're right

Somehow, somewhere I went and crossed
Over the line
And I let you see the man that was hiding inside
It's highly irregular, I must confess
No this usually isn't my style
Oh I know my heart's beatin' out of my chest
And I just can't do nothin' but smile

And I dream about you day and night
If you think for a moment I can't live without you
And maybe I've fallen in love with you

Baby, you're right

Baby, you're so wrong if you think
That you're holdin' on just a little too tight
But, if you're believin' that I'm never leavin' you

And I dream about you day and night

Rolls off my tongue like a nursery rhyme
Wooden numbers on the front of your house
Where we fell in love 
Little things they stick in my mind
Like they happened yesterday after all this time

I never would've thought
I'd remember so much

But why is my heart so weak
And my memory so strong
Somebody give me one good reason
Love is too short

And forgettin's so long
Somewhere, someday down the road maybe I won't care
But when something so right goes so worng
Love is too short and forgettin's so long

Is there anyone who would please 
Tell me where's my checkbook and my car keys
If it wasn't sewn onto my shoulders
I'da lost my head
Well there's a whole lotta things I forget to do
But I amaze myself when it comes to you
I know nothin' 'bout now 
But I know plenty 'bout way back then

'Cause when I think I got it all behind me
And I'm movin' along

As fast and far away from me
As she could get

To help a love a little off course
Well, I'm losin' her, heaven knows I can't do that

Phil Vassar," I went back in time today a box I thought
I'd thrown away
Had fallen off the basement shelf,
I tripped and almost hurt myself
Scattered there across the floor
A New Year's Eve hat from '94
Ticket stubs to Billy Joel and pictures
From the Sugar Bowl
Some of these souvenirs I remember
Mostly I don't 
It's funny how time reduces a keepsake 
To a footnote

The wheres and the whens that meant
So much then
Have gracefully moved along
My memory had mercy on me and let me go on
Considering everything you meant I thought
I never would forget

Here's us dancing on your birthday
July 29th or 28th
The song was ""Always and Forever,""
I'm not sure but I remember
That's the night we first made love
The passion captured both of us
It held us, then it set us free,
This is all that's left of you and me
A cardboard treasure chest with a diary
Of two lovers
Now it's a dusty old box no different 
From the others

The wheres and the whens that meant
So much then
Have gracefully moved along
My memory had mercy on me and let me go on
Considering everything you meant I thought
I never would forget

The one you hold
I'll wrap my love around you until time
Grows old
That ray of faith
That glimpse of sun

That life, is as simple as a song

Lovers they come and surely they go
They fly you so high say hello say goodbye
They leave you low
But that's all right here in these songs that I write
All right here on these old black and whites

Down in the basement, big killer stereo

Christine was a doctor to be
Life stretched out before us like one endless summer
And that brings us to me
I was the gypsy

We were ready to take the world on
Four young soldiers of fate
Couldn't wait to go right every wrong
Wearing our passion, our hopes
Out t-shirts and jeans
Dancin' with dreams

Ten years ago May we all drank to the future
And all went out separate ways
I packed up to go with my clothes and piano
And music and something to say

I hear Paul owns a drum shop
Jane teaches ballet
And Christine's an ob-gyn
I'm writing songs that I sing in a cafe
And sometimes I write about them
I miss my friends

Lost touch, we lost in love
And lost our minds when things got tough

Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call that will even be better
Give the wife a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
Tell them all my future's looking bright and I miss them

Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is,
As I drove away.
You know Amy was his only love,
In a moment she was gone, long gone:
It could have been me or you.
Oh, baby, there's no time to lose.

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses,
An' pour us a glass of wine.

An' turn down the lights.
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you,
An' rock you all through the night,
An' I'm gonna love you,

Looks like to me you're feelin' kinda crowded
You're not lookin' for anything permanent here
So my Rodeo's packed and in goodbye gear

So I shot down to the Longhorn Diner
Her sister works there and she'd know where to find her
She said, you didn't hear it from me
All I'll say is mama's got that place out in Monterrey

Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy apple red Rodeo

Two towns back I showed your photograph
And the gas station man just started to laugh
She said I might see you in this bucket of rust
And said good luck boy, just follow that cloud of dust

Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I've gotta let her know
I need the girl in that little red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy apple red Rodeo

Maybe I was straddling the fence just like she said
It took her leaving to get it through my head

She's the one and only, it's over, that's it
I'm committed, I'm in love and I'm desperate
She's a good ways gone but I'm closin' the gap
If I have to I'll chase her clear across the map

Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here in my next thirty years

Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers

Fame and fortune come with a heavy price
Son, don't miss your life.""

Funny you should say that, I was sitting at the gate
My daughter called, she made straight A's and they're off to celebrate.
Scrolling through the pictures of my little family
My daughter with her mom and friends, not a single one with me.
They know I love 'em, I know they know I care
The truth is half the time, I'm not even there.

I missed our fourth and fifth anniversary
Our girl was early by a week
Her sister had to hold her hand
I was in L.A., she said ""I understand""
I missed her first day of school
Then what kind of crazy fool
Lets such precious moments pass
We all know time goes way too fast
Hold on tight ‘cause it don't happen twice
Don't miss your life.

When I get off this plane, I'll buy a turn-around ticket
Saturday's her eighth birthday and I'm not gonna miss it

There'll be balloons and birthday cake
And I'll clean up the mess they make
My mom and dad are drivin' in
I haven't seen 'em in God knows when
My wife will probably say to me
""I thought you were supposed to be in Portland
For a few more days"", I'll take her in my arms and say
""I heard some words that hit me hard last night,
A man said: 'Don't miss your life'.""",Don't Miss Your Life,2012
Phil Vassar,"A hundred miles 'til I get home
And I can't wait to get you alone
And hold you close as I can get,
You think you've been loved, you haven't been yet
Feel your hair across my skin,
It takes me somewhere I've never been, girl
I love you, you love me,
Carved it all on the willow tree

And love, love is alive tonight
Love is alive, love is alive tonight

Your mama likes me, your daddy does too
He likes this cross on my tattoo
Reminds him of when he was younger
Starving girl, with this hunger
I can't ever satisfy, it's burning me up deep inside
And I can't get enough of this
I need a long forever kiss

And your love, love is alive tonight
Love is alive, love is alive tonight

Love tells the truth, it never lies
Never looks for alibis
It's smaller than a baby's touch
Bigger than the both of us

Girl you're deep inside of me
Where I thought no one could ever be
Can't wait a minute longer
Can you feel it gettin' stronger?

Love, love is alive tonight
Love is alive, love is alive tonight

Yeah, it's bigger than the whole wide world
And it's in you and in me, girl
Love is black and love is white
It's never wrong, it's always right
It's a candle, you can't hide her
It's a roller-coaster ride
Yeah, love is alive, oh",Love is Alive,2013

I've had a dream
And now I'm feeling rather frightened
And I wish someone would tell me what it means.
Wiseman #1: We are your wisemen
Yes, that is true
And though we're using all our wisdom
We're afraid we can't explain your dream to you.
King Darius: What!?
Wiseman #2: But there is one who is wiser still
And Daniel is his name
So before you take another sleeping pill
Perhaps he can explain.
Daniel: My name is Daniel
That much is true
But it is God who gives me wisdom
And through me He will explain your dreams to you.
Maid: His name is Daniel
That's what he said
But when he talks about this God of his
I think he's kind of loony in the head. (I do.)
Narrator: Well, Daniel was able to explain the king's dream. And this
Made the king very happy.

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1987

And meet the young lady who fell from a star.
She fell from the sky,
She fell very far and Kansas she says is the name of the star.
Kansas she say is the name of the star.
She brings you good news or haven't  you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle, what happened was just this.
The wind began to switch, the house to pitch, and suddenly the hinges started 
to unhitch.
Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing 
for a hitch.
And oh what happen'd was rich.
The house began to pitch,the kitchen took a slitch,it landed on the wicked 
witch in the middle of a ditch.
Which was not a healthy situation for a wicked witch.

Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go

I committed crime, Lord, I needed
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding
When they caught me robbing his store

[Chorus]

I heard the judge say five years
On chain-gang you gonna go
I heard the judge say five years labor
I heard my old man scream ""Lordy, no!""

[Chorus]

Gonna see my sweet honey bee
Gonna break this chain off to run
Gonna lay down somewhere shady
Lord, I sure am hot in the sun

Hold it right there while I hit it
Well reckon that ought to get it
Been workin' and workin'
Been workin' and slavin'
And workin' and workin'
But I still got so terribly far to go",Work Song,1964

How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.

 and lovely as you.

Phil Woods,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind [From the Thomas Crown Affair],1975

How tears can burn one's heart
But that's a thing that I found out
Too late I guess, Cause I'm in a mess

My faith has gone 
Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me
Yet I know that it's hopeless
You could never really care.
That's why I despair!

Someday you'll learn
The flame in my heart, Dear,
Forever will burn!",Yardbird Suite,1976

Phil Woods,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1980

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

You know I'm yours for just the taking

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind

He's there
The phantom of the opera
Beware the phantom of the opera

In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the opera is here/there

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Philip Catherine,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999
Philip Catherine,"Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere

Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Philip Catherine,"I sit alone in the golden daylight,
But all I see is a silver sky,
For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,
Just the way we like it, you and I.

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,
The evening mist melts away,
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.",All Through the Day,2002
Philip Catherine,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2002

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Philip Chaffin,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

Philip Claypool,"Before you draw the final curtain
Before the big top crashes down
Before you pack away my trunk case
I'd like to take a final bow

One last chance to hear the laughter
And to see your face there in the crowd
One last moment in the spotlight
One last chance to be your clown

I guess you're tired of walking tightropes
Of settin' up and tearing down
You want a place to call forever
And rest your feet on solid ground

Somewhere you lost that sense of wonder
But that's still the place I'm bound
Like a storm in search of thunder
I'm just a circus leaving town

Once we could fill a room with laughter
And fill each other's hearts with joy
Through each trial and disaster
'Til we'd cling to our choice

To take a path so unforgiving a road
That waits for no one
We know we chose to keep on living
Oh, tell me where did we go wrong?

I guess you're tired of walking tightropes
Of settin' up and tearing down
You want a place to call forever
And rest your feet on solid ground

Don't try and break this spell I'm under
Or stop these wheels from spinning round
For I'm a storm in search of thunder
Yeah, I'm a circus leaving town

Someday you'll wake up and wonder
And your heart will start to pound
And you'll long for the thunder
And the kisses of a clown

",Circus Leaving Town,1995
Philip Claypool,"Well, operator, operator, help me please
We get a war goin' on, we can't get no peace
We're either screamin' on the telephone yellin' in the yard

So can you send out someone like they do on T-V
I'm talkin' 911, emergency
Send help quick, Lord, there ain't much time
Someone's wrecking this heart of mine

She kicked my dog and slammed the door
Stole my heart and my brand new Ford
No, she ain't no lady she's just a rolling stone

You should've heard the things she said
As she ripped the sheets right off of my bed
And I got a bad bad feeling that
We ain't seen the end of her yet

Well, officer, officer, it ain't no lie
I ain't good looking I'm a pretty nice guy
At church on Sunday and at work all week
Just tryin' to make a living for the lady and me

And though she may be pretty she's mean as a snake
I need protection for goodness sake
I've done taken as much as I can
I ain't Schwartzenegger, I'm only a man

She kicked my dog and slammed the door
Stole my heart and my brand new Ford
No she ain't no lady she's just a rolling stone

She killed my lawn and all the trees
Ripped my big screen color TV
And now there ain't no tellin'
What next she'll be doing to me

Well, I don't understand how this trouble and strife
Can go hand in hand with the love of my life
But there ought to be a little price to pay
For treatin' a man and his dog that way

She kicked my dog and slammed the door
Stole my heart and my brand new Ford
No, she ain't no lady she's just a rolling stone

I still recall the words she said

Seeing you sittin' next to me is like a drive across the Golden Gate
Your hair is like fields in autumn neath the brightenin' western sun
Beneath it's your way of loving that makes me come undone

It's your southern style, ah, nice and slow and easy
I'm deep in southern comfort from morning' through the evening
A little bit old fashioned and just a touch untame
It's your southern style that's got me feeling this way

If I could toss a silver dollar, oh, down a wishing well
I wish you'd take me for your man and be my belle
For I'd stand there beside you all through the thick and thin
I'd love you all life long, over and over again

I'm talking about southern style ?

I get a taste of honey, when you kiss me with your lips so soft and warm
It's heaven when you hold me all wrapped up in your angel arms

Philip Claypool,"I remember the phone every evening
Ringing till it fell off the wall
Seemed like every single guy in town
Was looking for a buddy to call

It was a honky tonk convention
Sprucing up to get on down
I thought we had same intention
But that ain't what I found

'Cause weekend after weekend, day after day

No, I'm just havin' a ball swingin' on my baby's chain
I'm just havin' a ball swingin' on my baby's chain

I remember that crowded bar room
We saw she was headin' our way
Just a lady in a room full of roosters
Crowing out their line of the day

She didn't hear a word they were saying
She just walked right into my life
She took me by the hand like she had it all planned
And we danced on into the night

Oh, weekend after weekend, day after day
Always together, two of a kind
Just dancing life's heartaches away

While my friends are growing old and lazy
You know I ain't feeling no pain

I guess I never thought she'd make it to that city limit sign
Lord, I waited twenty minutes thinking she'd come running back
But this fool got fooled 'cause she's already out there making tracks

She's just a mile outside of Memphis and I'm already out of my mind
I must have lost my senses to let that little girl leave me behind
I wish that I could stop her but I know that it's too late
Her mind's made up she's headed down that interstate
She's a mile out of Memphis and I'm already out of my mind

You gave her heartaches until she'd had enough

Oh, you never should have gambled what you could not stand to lose
And now you know why they call Memphis the home of the blues, oh yeah

They said, no by heck but we will get her yet
Because they were looking for her too.

And when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling

She said he left with a lady patient

Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,

Dust myself off,

And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Simply rests to strike again
Standing, waiting, I think of her

Strange, this Mary, she leaves the room
Yet remains, she lingers on
Something stirs me to think of her
I think of her

From death she casts her spell
All night we hear her sighs
And now a girl has come
Who has her eyes

She has her eyes
The girl has Lily's hazel eyes
Those eyes that saw him happy long ago
Those eyes that gave him life
And hope he'd never known
How can he see the girl
And miss those hazel eyes?

She has her eyes
The girl has Lily's hazel eyes
Those eyes that closed and left me all alone
Those eyes I feel will never ever let me go
How can I see this girl who has her hazel eyes?

In Lily's eyes a castle
This house seemed to be
And I, the bravest knight became
My lady fair was she

She has her eyes
She has my Lily's hazel eyes
Those eyes that loved my brother never me
Those eyes that never saw me
Never knew I longed to hold her close
To live at last in Lily's eyes

Imagine me, a lover
I longed for the day
She'd turn and see me standing there
Would God have let her stay
She has her eyes
She has my Lily's hazel eyes
Those eyes that saw me happy long ago

How can I now forget
That once I dared to be in love
Be alive and whole

Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers-place
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
Thats what those lovers do

I know an ambush where we won't be found
And so we went to the place, honey
Listening to the all-night-singing-sweet-melodies-fairy trees
And there was no better place to be
And so we took off to the moon

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Pour que je les croie un peu",Mécontente,2018
Philippe B,"Tant que la neige tombe tombera
Tant que la neige tombe tombera
Tranquille tant qu’il neigera
Content d’attendre le lilas

Nous irons danser sur les toits de la ville
Tant que la neige tombera

Tant que l’étang gèle gèlera
Tant que l’étang gèle gèlera
Tranquille tant qu’il ne cale pas
Content de marcher sur les eaux

Nous irons prier sur les toits de la ville
Ou a défaut d’étoiles une croix
Brille dans le froid

Nous irons mourir sur les toits de la ville
Le jour ou l’île coulera",Tant Que La Neige,2018
Philippe B.,"I'm tired of telling the story
Tired of telling it your way
Yeah I know what I saw
I know that I found the floor

Before you take my heart reconsider
Before you take my heart reconsider
I've opened the door
I've opened the door

Here comes the summer's son
He burns my skin
I ache again
I'm over you

I thought I had a dream to hold
Maybe that has gone
Your hands reach out and touch me still
But this feels so wrong

Before you take my heart reconsider
Before you take my heart reconsider
I've opened the door

Here comes the summer's son
He burns my skin
I ache again
I'm over you

To cleanse my skin
I wake again
I'm over you

E mais misteriosa das deusas
Do candomblé baiano
Aquela que sabe tudo
Sobre as ervas
Sobre a alquimia do amor""

Já não quis!

Uma estrela aparecer
Na manhã de um novo amor

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,

Oh, make 'em play that crazy thing again

I got a soul that's not for savin' now.

Philippe Combelle,"I remember the bliss
Of that wonderful kiss.
I knew that a boy
Could never have more joy
From any little miss.

I remember it quite,
'Twas a wonderful night.

If you would encore it.

Fly again to heaven.
Baby, see
It's A, B, C,
I love you and you love me.
I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, Baby;

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't

Come true, baby,
My heart begins to hum,

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.

I can't see that at all,
True love never should pall.

I was only teasing;
What you did was pleasing.

Philippe de Canck,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1996
