Floetry,"There is only one for me
You have made that possibility
We can take that step to see
If this is really gonna be

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you, baby;
Open up your mind and express
I'm about to let you know you make me
So, so, so,so,so,so,so
You make me
So, so, so,so,so,so,so, ah

Loving you has taken time, taken time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognize the butterflies, inside me, Uh
Since it's gonna be made tonight, tonight
All you gotta do is say yes

Floetry,"You know sometimes we ummm, 
We don't recognize our dreams inside
Our reality and uh other times 
We're not aware of exactly
What's real ya know we walk around day dreaming But the sunshine, the sunshine always is, and I

[Chorus]
I just want to see my lovely sunshine(Sunshine)
I just want to bring back all of my blue skies
And if you take away my rainbow I will cry(cry)
Give me back my sunshine

Dreaming my state of being and I see you smiling You're so happy just laughing and standing strong I'm missing you right here 
Listen to my tears I'm waking up to skies so gray
Needing you to brighten up my day

Okay listen catch your breath cool out 
You need to calm down (that's right)
Concentrate don't go making all your time run out
See your okay it looks much worse than it really is,
And you'll pull through come on you know how we be doing this
It's me and you yo, you promised you can't pull out now,
We're friends for life so you can't just sell me out 
We shared a lot but you know we'll see just so much more
Our wedding day and the children that we prayed for

[Chorus]

I used to depend on your rides to show me the way that I should go 
My reality is blurry I'm afraid of being all alone
Your light has been my guide throughout the good and bad 
I wish that I had spent a little more attention to my one and only sunshine

Listen, I'd never leave you yo, 
I swore on my grave
Damn what's that I'm feeling dizzy 
Kinda getting faint
But it ain't nothing 
Didn't sleep that much last night
From watching over you but none less I'm cool I'm fine
I said I'm feeling fine 
So back up off me I'm alright
I'm here to see my friends 
And what's up with that blinding light
Said I don't need to lie down 
I don't need your help right now 
What's up with all the noises all the running round
You've got it wrong I'm not the one 
Who needs the help in here
Yo, what's up with you, 
You're crying I see tears
Yo, what's going on don't leave 
Please don't take her out
Said I don't understand 
I'm kinda feeling scared now
I said it's getting hard to breathe 
Getting hard to see
I'm not too sure anymore what's going on with me
Please bring her back connect me 
Talk just one more time 
But it's too late the last exhale is mine

[Chorus: x2]",Sunshine,2002
Floetry,"Butterflies inside you give me butterflies inside
Butterflies inside you give me butterflies inside 
Butterflies inside you give me butterflies inside 

All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by 
Don't acknowledge my smile yea when I try to say hello to you 
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm tryna get through 
To keep me wondering why and all I can do is sigh I just wanna oh

I just want to touch and kiss 
And I wish that I could be with you tonight 
You give me butterflies inside 
Inside and I

All I gotta say is I must be dreaming 
Cant be real 
Your not here with me 
I can feel you near to me 
So I caress you let you taste us 
Just so blissful listen I would give anything 
Make my dream come true baby you give me butterflies 

I just want to touch and kiss 
And I wish that I could be with you tonight 
You give me butterflies inside

I just want to touch and kiss 
And I wish that I could be with you tonight 
You give me butterflies inside

If you will take my hand baby i will show you guide you to the light babe 
If you will be my love baby I will love you 
Love you till the end of time 

I just want to touch and kiss 
And I wish that I could be with you tonight 
You give me butterflies inside

Floetry,"Laundered linen sheets
Touch me their coldness
And thoughts I can't repeat
Shock me with their boldness
Why did my mind and body believe,
That you would never leave them
Now there's parts of me that blame,
Or well they force me to deceive them
So come back and relieve them

Who would steal you?
I still feel you
Now you're gone
These are lies
They're not real
This is more than I can feel
This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong

A bath so hot it almost scolds
And I let the warm surround me
I slide down
Till only my face shows
But I feel colder now
Than before you found me
When u used to pin me down
The clarity in your intent
But if you mind was somewhere else
I cant better anything you can invent
I thought you understood how much you meant

Who would steal you?
I still feel you
Now you're gone
And these are lies
It's not real
This is more than I can feel
It's all wrong
Now you're gone
I work hard to carry on
If you could've seen
How I've been
Then you'd know how much you meant

Who would steal you
I feel you
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Gone, gone, gone
Don't you know how much you meant?

Floetry,"Yo, do you feel clever?
No, forget what everyone else has to say
Do you feel clever?

Subliminally, subliminal
Subliminally, subliminal
Subliminally

It's like, I live in whatever like is
Always raining, similar, never the same
See the game don't play that, so I speak maybes and if onlys
Instead of I ams and fallen memories

All that don't feel to good to be
But my genealogy registers adaptability and that bitch
Feels like it's fixed
'Cause my great grandmother spoke of this exact same thing

I use rhyme but I think she used to sing
Or just bring her force to a circle of women
And they be aligning chakrias and meditating
Bad vibe vaccinating, evil energy eliminating
As well as debating on how to raise the children and love the men

But today we're more caught up in Ricki Lakes and Jerry Springer
Becoming Numb, now that's the title of my narrative base, novel of fiction
But still my fascination is loyal to how we manage to stay, we, human
A once civilized nation, or so they told me, yo

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to be
It's subliminal, subliminally
Subliminal, subliminally

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to be
It's subliminal, subliminally
Subliminal, subliminally

You see, breast was a blessing so I owe no shit
Obligation is a choice, but this choice I select
Who to share my love with, love me and be in
'Cause I believe that I am leaving with most are submerged in

It's a messed up situation
So stay stationed is the advice that I leave
To those who can't come to those you won't proceed
You can stay right here

And if you ever pass go, do not collect 200, I repeat do not collect
So I'm this disputing being openly happy
When it serves so well to be depressed

Any attempt of smiling needs impeccable timing
Make the suit sweet by allowing them to feel
That they suited the situation to the masses, to the market
Keep them pushing Beemers

My friend I may not be able to deliver a Benz to you
But I can give you piece of mind
Piece of mine

Define ownership, now will your mothership take with it
What you purchased at your outlet
So my friend once again I'll just give you piece of mind

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to see
It's subliminal, subliminally
It's subliminal, subliminally

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to see
It's subliminal, subliminally
It's subliminal, subliminally

[Incomprehensible] yes, it's [Incomprehensible]

This cowards walking with a complex here
We drop him so quick we from the crib to the film set
Ain't nothing new about the soul or new about your flow
If you want your stripes you got to earn them yo
This goes out to you and you and you
And if you feel it in your heart yo it must be true
Walk how you walk and do what you do

Floetry,"Sometimes blindness finds me and leads me through ignorance
Not allowing us to gain experience so we become lifeless
At other times I cover with self pity or work aimlessly through reality
So occasionally I choose to travel alone

But never fulfill my possibility
So mostly I attempt to achieve balance
By seeking right knowledge and loving and reviewing
And eventually over standing those many lessons of my life

You got me caught in a stormy eyed world that drains
And I beg to see truth and promises you made to me
Now we've come so far but my visions of happiness
With you in my life I'm afraid and confused
If I was a bird I'd fly

If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain
If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Now why do I feel so alone knowing I know I have you
And what made you turn around on me what did I do?
And when did love feel this way so much pain and misery
Where's the you I once knew and could you fly with me?

If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Floetry,"We wrote fairy tales
Of how we'll live in castles
Tight like Hansel and Gretel
And grow old and settle

In a town that we'll tighten
With our marry day
We gonna love like that
Like everyday like every way

Like can I stay at yours tonight?
We can hold tight, love bite
And share some soul
We can pick and roll

Lose control and let me take it
Like how I let you break it
Don't forget we could

Get high on each other
And serve time for it
Through the night and back
Into the morning, can't crack the habit

So, you see I'm feeling
I'm needing some more
And you got me grinning like it's
Money that I'm winning

No way is this ending
'Cause you got me feeling purer than thou
You need to show me how you do this thing
'Cause you got me singing like

I'll crown you king of this throne
If you can take me home
Like runs with no stripes
It doesn't have to be tonight

How's about early morning, I'm talking AM
We can beat the dawn
Or just chill through time barriers
Can't help the whispers of I do

But you see through my proper test
Got me making game faces
In London we say lacing you say making sense
This shit's intense ya, I kinda ? offense

'Cause you move me
So I broke my role and I got freaky with it
You chastise me with my own belt
I ain't gonna lie, I felt the universe move

You left me singing like opera
Like Cleopatra or Madam Butterfly
Yo it feels so good you brought tears
To my eyes I was like

Now, was that supposed to happen
All that foot tappin' voice breakin'
Now I'm carving Kamasutra diagrams, y'all
With the headboard

Ignored the buzzer four times
Got up hard telling lies
Even surprised myself
With my conniving ways

I dived in like he meant survival
Like he was christened H-two-O
Like he could make the trees grow
And the clouds spit snow

He laid kisses on my chest
Like his name was Zorro
Had me saying, ""Hell No""
When he said he had to go

I was hiding clothes
And play fighting like children
We were clashing our Titans
Till weight we were losing

I had Slum Village album on repeat
We were knockin' boots to hip hop beats
I even reached my maximum in my sleep

From watchin' over you but nonetheless, I'm cool, I'm fine
I said I'm feelin' fine so back up off me, I'm alright
I'm here to see my friends, yo, what's up with that blindin' light?
Said I don't need to lie down, I don't need your help right now
What's up with all the noises, all the runnin' around

You've got it wrong, I'm not the one who needs the help in here
Yo, what's up with you, you're crying, I see tears
Yo, what's going on, don't leave, please don't take her out
Said I don't understand, I'm kinda feelin' scared now
I said it's gettin' hard to breathe, gettin' hard to see
I'm not too sure anymore what's going on with me

Far behind, I?ll exchange my mind

Always asking for never noticing
Every move I make, this game?s reacting in
Perfect symmetry, I'm my destiny, must invest in me
Or I'm just gonna be victim of circumstance

All is left to chance, how can I enhance?

Floetry,"Karma usually comes wearing the stranger's light
It's easier to deal with that way
But now it's you, I've hurt you, disrespected you
There's nowhere to hide, no turning back, no rearrangement
Only what lies ahead and you're so Heaven sent

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby

I'm sorry for giving you the cold shoulder
Never been this wrong before
Never stood my ground and breathed it in before
All I wanted to do is hold ya
Never felt so brave and so afraid before
Never faced alone and felt the peace before

With tears in my eyes I come to you sincerely
Excepting this space I'm in
Growing outta the phase where I just wanna win
You act as though you don't even hear me
Look at me baby look at me I know you

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby

Growth I released my grief it was a heavy load
Survived the sleep and now I'm letting go
Waking up and living up to what I had proposed
Woman now I love the girl I used to be
Ever step she took was reaching out to me
Every breath is blessed responsibility, we made it baby

I can't control your feelings, feel me
I can't take back, what I've done
With my hand on my heart
I'm coming to you sincerely if you hear me I know you

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
I love you, I love you, think about it baby

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby

Baby think about it we know better
But love has no expectations
So I don't expect you to do anything
Think about it

This is for me I'm offering this to you
To free myself
'Cause I know what I have to do
This is my apology think about it baby

It's a pretty day let's go outside and enjoy it
If you got something else in mind then I'm all for it
I will take the chance I will take your hand
Then we'll go there, go there

Love isn't something that you earn, it's deserved
Love is something I can give 'cause I'm worth it

You're so lovely, I can

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar

My man said heaven is a day away
If in the present you loving in a braver way
I wear the aura of a king and dream of a love supreme
As a child I was told that my love is king

Seeing what it can bring to the lives of those
That ain't afraid to give with their souls exposed, golden rose
You color my reality with balladry allowing me to
Me to love like a child that's free, I'm proud to be your superstar

My love is honest and true and I can prove it babe
My love is everything to you if you choose it babe
You're amazing I'm so taken in
You're so lovely, I can

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar

You know I liked him so much that it turned into loving
Then the love back to like now I feel like I'm bursting
More nurse than my name 'em so full of potential
He stands tall I feel it's internal

Fine like the earth and the sea and the sky
Together we make stars we are truly fly
I wanna paint him take a picture of his soul
His story should be told

See he's like everything I dreamed of
But better than the preview
Now everything he working on
Has got me saying me too

Like he food that I need, blood 'cause he bleed
He real 'cause I see, it's all meant to be
Remember how to make believe
Yo these brothers are your enemy

You're in a state of disbelief
Without your heart you'll never be
So sister's sing along with me
Because your love is true

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do

Check one two, check one two
De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin' nowhere
Old school is here to stay boy

On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N Y mentality for me, to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some
(Young Guns these days got fireproof eardrums)

They don't give a shit who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy and be the would-be king
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down
(And what makes the world go 'round)
And I be the world renowned wonder why
Wonderin' why you can't stand me?
Is it because I'm the main Jackson?
And y'all just Titos and Randys? Yes it is
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last

At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin' you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy, just settin' it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in raggin'
My daughter says I'm a teen, 'cause like a teen
My pants always saggin' and I walk with a bop
The sex part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on loud
But cooked rhymes that make the chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still anything goes when it comes to hoes because

Make this relevant and here what you gotta hear 
I'm recordin' all the secrets of my silent shed 
Don't think about it just absorb everything you taste 
If it set you free you gonna find the ways 
You're who you gonna be unless you choose otherwise

We were young and wild and free

Now, nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me coming back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Pick you up when you're feeling down

No, nothing could change what you mean to me
There's a lot that I could say
But, just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

Pó, poeira, ventania
Se você soltar o pé na estrada, pó, poeira
Eu danço com você o que você dançar

Flora Purim,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2003

Floreal Ruiz,"Era más blanda que el agua
que el agua blanda
Era más fresca que el río,
naranjo en flor
Y en esa calle de estío,
calle perdida,
dejó un pedazo de vida
y se marchó.

Primero hay que saber sufrir,
después amar, después partir
y al fin andar sin pensamiento.
Perfume de naranjo en flor,
promesas vanas de un amor
que se escaparon en el viento.

Después, qué importa del después
Toda mi vida es el ayer
que me detiene en el pasado
Eterna y vieja juventud
que me ha dejado acobardado
como un pájaro sin luz.

Que le habrán hecho mis manos?
Que le habrán hecho,
para dejarme en el pecho
tanto dolor?
Dolor de vieja arboleda,
canción de esquina,
con un pedazo de vida,
naranjo en flor.",Naranjo en Flor,1997
Floreal Ruiz,"San Juan y Boedo antiguo y todo el cielo,
Pompeya y, más alla, la inundación,
tu melena de novia en el recuerdo,
y tu nombre flotando en el adios...
La esquina del herrero barro y pampa,
tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjon
y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
que me llena de nuevo el corazón.

Sur... paredón y después...
Sur... una luz de almacen...
Ya nunca me veras como me vieras,
recostado en la vidriera
y esperandote,
ya nunca alumbrare con las estrellas
nuestra marcha sin querellas
por las noches de Pompeya.
Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
y mi amor en tu ventana
todo ha muerto, ya lo se.

San Juan y Boedo antiguo, cielo perdido,
Pompeya y, al llegar al terraplen,
tus veinte años temblando de cariño
bajo el beso que entonces te robe.
Nostalgia de las cosas que han pasado,
arena que la vida se llevo,
pesadumbre del barrio que ha cambiado
y amargura del sueño que murio.

""We are all too young to die""

That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept between two lungs

The days of theft

May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

Fallen out of trees and I've fallen on my face
Fallen out of taxis, out of windows too
Fell in your opinion when I fell in love with you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Sometimes I wish for falling, wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air to give me some relief
Because falling's not the problem, when I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground it causes all the grief

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

This is a song for a scribbled-down name
And my love keeps writing again and again
This is a song for a scribbled-down name
And my love keeps writing again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again

I dance with myself, I drunk myself down
Found people to love, left people to drown
I'm not scared to jump, I'm not scared to fall
If there was nowhere to land I wouldn't be scared at all
At all

Drank further away from the shore
And deeper into the drink

Sat on the bottom of the ocean,
A stern and stubborn rock

But somehow I forgot

I was sinking, but now I'm sunk
And I was drinking, and now I'm drunk

I can't remember the verse

Is now the life jacket that burst

Sinking like a siren that can't swim anymore

Saw what I'd done he set up a nest outside,
And he sang about what I'd become
He sang so loud, sang so clear
I was afraid all the neighbours would hear,
So I invited him in, just to reason with him
I promised I wouldn't do it again

But he sang louder and louder inside the house,
And no I couldn't get him out
So I trapped him under a cardboard box
Stood on it to make him stop
I picked up the bird and above the din I said
That's the last song you'll ever sing
Held him down, broke his neck,
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget

But in my dreams began to creep
That old familiar tweet tweet tweet

I opened my mouth to scream and shout,
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout,
Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout

Waved my arms and flapped about

About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (came to weeping)

And I heard your voice

And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honour
Dancing on tiptoes
My own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard doing handstands

And I heard your voice

Of great men and the smallest of gestures

And the words are all escaping me
And coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand

'Cause I've been scrawling it forever

And sings to me inside
It cries out in the darkest night
And breaks in the morning light

I sang by that piano, tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried

And I don’t wanna see what I’ve seen

Now there’s green light in my eyes

On this champagne, drunken hope
Against the current, all alone
Everybody, see, I love him

When the afternoon is set
On a bridge into the city

To try and keep from calling you
Well, can my dreams keep coming true
How can they, cause when I sleep
I never dream of you

As if the dream of you, it sleeps too
But it never slips away
It just gains its strength and digs its hooks
To drag me through the day

And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

It's the hardest thing I've ever had to prove
You turn to salt as I turned around to look at you
Old friends have said, the books I've read
Say it's the thing to do
But it's hard to see it when you're in it
Cause I went blind for you

Then you leave my head and crawl out of bed
Subconscious [?]
And for those hours deep in the dark
Perhaps you don't exist

But I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

Desperate and divine

I'll get a break

Where standers are pretenders, cheap and stingy
All I smell is rotten scotch and ginger

Among the guys who've never learned what ""no"" means
You ask me do I know what making dough means

My lonely plea 
Is this where I must end up?

When the nightclubs are closing and the whole world is dozing and sleeping until the dawn? Why, all its glory and splendor and marvelous sights, they all fade out together as they turn out the lights, with street beggars mumbling, milk wagons rumbling, dream castles tumbling in the air.

In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,

the others more like milk.

Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we ride back home in the surrey,
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.

Florence Welch,"Between two lungs it was released
The breath that carried me
The sigh that blew me forward

'Cause it was trapped
Trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs

And my running feet could fly
Each breath screaming
""We are all too young to die""

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept between two lungs
It was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept

'Cause it was trapped
Tapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs

Now all the days of begging
The days of theft
No more gasping for a breath
The air has filled me head-to-toe
And I can see the ground far below
I have this breath
And I hold it tight
And I keep it in my chest
With all my might
I pray to God this breath will last
As it pushes past my lips
As I gasp

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me",Between Two Lungs,2011
Florence Welch,"Seems that I have been held, in some dreaming state
A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake
No kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber
Until I realize that it was you who held me under

Felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
Shaking through my skull, through my spine and down through my ribs

No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

And I could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack
And all around the world was waking, I never could go back
'Cause all the walls of dreaming, they were torn right open
And finally it seemed that the spell was broken

And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open

No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

Florence Welch,"A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them, and now it's left me blind

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness,
So darkness I became

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

I took the stars from our eyes, and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you

You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight

I pray that the water will drown out the din
But as the water fills my mouth
It couldn't wash the echoes out
But as the water fills my mouth
It couldn't wash the echoes out

I swallow the sound and it swallows me whole

I held it in but now it seems you've set it running free
Screaming in the dark, I howl when we're apart
Drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart

My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to howl
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to

Howl, howl
Howl, howl

Now there's no holding back, I'm making an attack
My blood is singing with your voice, I want to pour it out
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloodied feet across the hallow'ed ground

Like some child possessed, the beast howls in my veins
I want to find you, tear out all of your tenderness

And howl, howl
Howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters
Hunters, hunters, hunters
Hunters, hunters, hunters

The fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
Until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloodied feet across the hallowed ground

And howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters

A man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by night
May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

He fits them together in sunshine or rain

He crafts everyone with love and with care

Hoy yo me ahogo en un mar de recuerdos
Yo construía un castillo de sueños
Que pronto se derrumbo
Cuando te vi en aquel bosque encantado
Un duende dijo que tu eras mi príncipe azul
Como si fuera por arte de magia
Llenaste mis días de luz
Pero todo acabó
Ya nada quedó entre los dos
Porque como en un cuento un enorme dragón
Nos robo el corazón
Por favor donde estás
Tu eres mi otra mitad
Siempre estaré esperando
Y yo sé que un día regresaras

Algún día regresaras
Y nuestra historia se pierde a lo lejos
No encontrare tu mirada en secreto
Y dibujando mi olvido en silencio
Con el color de un adiós
Yo me invente todo un cuento de hadas
Pero al final nos ganó esa bruja tan cruel
Lo que soñamos quedó en el olvido
Y todo tu amor se perdió
Pero todo acabó
Ya nada quedó entre los dos
Porque como en un cuento
Un enorme dragón
Nos robo el corazón
Por favor donde estás

Que vendría él a buscarla
Con sus flores amarillas

Casi nunca está dormida

Nos esperaba el encuentro

La miro tan de frente

Si je ne suis pas le meilleur 
Serais je encore un homme

Entre sommeil et petit jour

Pour faire une place à mon amour

Tout piqueté de diamants doux
Quand la rivière défait son lit
Et qu'elle écarte ses genoux
Mes mains deviennent le chant des pluies

Entre confesse et pieux mensonge
Entre caresse et demi-tour
J'ouvre tes voies que je prolonge
Pour faire une place à mon amour

Et sur la mer vaguement femme
Quand ses courbures se silhouettent
Et qu'elles se gonflent et qu'elles réclament

Entre ma peur et ton sanglot

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Florent Pagny,"Rester vrai, c'est compliqué 
Comment se trouver, sans ressembler 

Travestis, dans nos pensées 
Pourquoi toujours écouter l'autre, l'autre parler 

Penser seul, individualité

Etre soi, mais sans tricher 
Parfois se trouver bien, bien obligé 

Essayer, le mot sincérité 
Du fond de ses défauts jusqu'à  ses qualités 

Etre soi, sans maquiller 
Mais chacun cherche ailleurs, ce qu'il est 

Au-delà  des influences

And how can we not know the reason why?
It took us all two thousand years of work and strife
Bringing the day we made God cry.

They taught us all from birth
There’s only one who rules upon this earth.
We know his name! We even claim we know his face.
Blue eyes or black.......... his sorrow’s our disgrace.

CHORUS:
So we lay our roads and slay the trees.
To possess more than our enemies.
And our means can justify the end. We’ll
Trample on a friend. So disrespectfully. 
And with all this anger in our hearts
We rebel and swear God plays a part.
So we kill and pray to make amends. The 
Story never ends and flags will burn again.

Tears falling from the sky.
Under the dust the city ceased to shine
And all the children search within their mother’s eyes.........
“ How could it be that we have made God cry?”

CHORUS:
So we lay our roads and slay the trees.
To possess more than our enemies.
And our means can justify the end. We’ll
Trample on a friend. So disrespectfully.
And we send our hatred from above
In the name of one who taught to love.
We proclaim we’re worthy of this place. The
Chosen human race could
Never justify.................the day we made God cry.",The Day We Made God Cry,2006
Florent Pagny,"Rappelle -toi de tes rêves
Silence est d'or
Quand le ciel reste couvert

Seul dans cette immense plaine
Et tu deviens le vent

Le voyage infini
Infini dans la nuit
Le voyage irréél
Et soudain l'image
Se fait plus belle

Nuit d'amour en sommeil
Sensation d'éternel
Nuit d'un jour sans réveil
Où tu cours et il te vient des ailes

Rappelle-toi plus rien ne t'arrête
Tu défies les lois de tous les états
Rappelle toi le brouillard s'arrête
Viennent ces couleurs qui n'existent pas

Rappelle toi de ces voix qui s'élèvent
Elles crient au ciel que l'amour est là
Rappelle toi et fais de beaux rêves
On a qu'une seule vie du moins c'est c'qu'on croit

Des milliers de voix dans les airs
Et tu es le vent rappelle toi",Rappelle-Toi de Tes Rêves,2006

Florent Pagny,"Même si un jour à Knocke-le-Zoute 
Je deviens comme je le redoute 
Chanteur pour femmes finissantes 
Que je leur chante "" Mi Corazon "" 
Avec la voix bandonéante 
D'un Argentin de Carcassonne 
Même si on m'appelle Antonio 
Que je brûle mes derniers feux 
En échange de quelques cadeaux 
Madame je fais ce que je peux 
Même si je me saoule à l'hydromel 
Pour mieux parler de virilité 
A des mémères décorées 
Comme des arbres de Noël 
Je sais qu' dans ma saoulographie 
Chaque nuit pour des éléphants roses 
Je chanterai la chanson morose

Etre une heure, une heure quelquefois 
Etre une heure, rien qu'une heure durant 
Beau, beau, beau et con à la fois 

Même si un jour à Macao 
Je deviens gouverneur de tripot 
Cerclé de femmes languissantes 
Même si lassé d'être chanteur 
J'y sois devenu maître chanteur 
Et que ce soit les autres qui chantent 
Même si on m'appelle le beau Serge 
Que je vende des bateaux d'opium 
Du whisky de Clermont-Ferrand 
De vrais pédés de fausses vierges 
Que j'aie une banque à chaque doigt 
Et un doigt dans chaque pays 
Que chaque pays soit à moi 
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit 
Tout seul au fond de ma fumerie 
Pour un public de vieux Chinois 
Je rechanterai ma chanson à moi

Etre une heure, une heure seulement 
Etre une heure, une heure quelquefois 
Etre une heure, rien qu'une heure durant

Où c'est pas tous les jours dimanche 
Même si on m'appelle Dieu le Père 
Celui qui est dans l'annuaire 
Entre Dieulefit et Dieu vous garde 
Même si je me laisse pousser la barbe 
Même si toujours trop bonne pomme 
Je me crève le coeur et le pur esprit 
A vouloir consoler les hommes 
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit 
J'entendrai dans mon 
Paradis Les anges, les Saints et Lucifer 
Me chanter la chanson de naguère

Florent Pagny,"Dice que la vida se hace con la suerte, yo tengo la suerte de vivir en paz
Fui un poco de todo, un poco diferente, sin politizar y sin poetizar
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça corazón

Como no me gusta la melancolía, ando sin remedio buscando qué hacer
El amor prefiero hacértelo de día, me gustan tus ojos y tu timidez
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça corazón

Porque yo no quiero dejar de creer, no tengo mucho que perder
Tengo la vida que quise tener
Pero no, no tengo nada que ocultar, lo que viví se olvidará
Lo que aprendí fue para continuar
Sabes bien, que hace ya tiempo que dejé de ser un tipo
Que hace todo bien, como los demás

Aprendí la vida con la diferencia que aprendí a mirarme sin ambigüedad
Vieron malos ratos sobre la conciencia pero no me gusta la fatalidad
C'est comme ça, c'est comme ça, corazón

El dinero le hace daño a la felicidad
Quédate un poco más que está llegando el día
Recuerda que mañana es sólo un día más

hoy va quedar claro que no somos solo amigos
esta noche hay fiesta no es un desatino
esta noche van a desvesarlse los vecinos

tal vez no tengas que esperar porque yo habri la puerta
no habrán mas invitados la noche será nuestra
y esta vez no habrá razones para de tener lo que por mucho tiempo había de ser que pues poner no vale la pena

Florent Pagny,"No te asombres si te digo lo que fuiste
Una ingrata con mi pobre corrazón
Porque el fuego de tus lindos ojos negros
Alumbraron el camino de otro amor

Y pensar que te adoraba tiernamente
Que a tu lado como nunca me sentí
Y por esas cosas raras de la vida
Sin el beso de tu boca yo me ví

Amor de mis amores
Reina mía que me hiciste
Que no puedo conformarme sin poderte contemplar
Ya que pagaste mal a mi cariño tan sincero
Lo que conseguiras que no te nombre nunca más

Amor de mis amores
Si dejaste de quererme
No hay cuidado que la gente de esto no se enterara
Que gano con decir que una mujer cambió mi suerte
Se burlaran de mí
Que nadie sepa mi sufrir

Je revois la ville en fete et en délire
Suffocant sous le soleil et sous la joie
Et j'entends dans la musique les cris les rires

Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de moi

Et perdu parmi ces gens qui
me bousculent
Étourdi, désemparé je reste là
Quand soudain je me retourne elle se recule
Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras

Que no puedo conformarme sin poderte contemplar

Todo es miedo y el destino no parece vacilar
E los caminos las huellas

Prefiero caer, prefiero arriesgar
Prefiero morir en el intento

En un instante viene y se va
Volver a ser nino y, como antes
Sonar despierto sin despertar
Sin despertar

Adios maldita soledad
Adios a ti fatalidad
Elijo rumbo a la verdad
Y con destino amar y amar
Ya no hay palabras de aliento que
No quiera escuchar

Florent Pagny,"Hey! ¿y tu? ¿Dónde están? 
Aca estoy
Y si, pero y usted por que no me ve
Soy petizo

Cuando era grande como un pez 
Y todo parecía mal 
La vida debía pasar
Cuando no sabía qué hacer 

Bajo campanas de un reló 
Bajo las faldas de mamá 
Me aseguraban sin dudar 
Que luego seria mejor 

A veces piensan que no voy
Por donde deberia andar
Pero no me gusta olvidar

Y cuando miro alrededor
Y todo me parece igual
Me gustaria reclamar
Ahora que puedo preguntar
A los que saben mucho mas
A los que deben responder

Dónde está la poesia
Dónde están los que podian
Donde van las ilusiones
Dónde están las decisiones
Dónde están las alegrias
Que le hace falta a la vida
Dónde esta lo que buscaba
Cuando no sabía de nada

Quizás parece que viví 
Mejor de lo que podía ser
Si bien recuerdo lo que vi
Cuando no sabia que hacer

Pero no pienso que este bien
Dejar las cosas como están
Porque alguien vendrá a preguntar
Y cuando miro alrededor
Y todo me parece igual
Ahora yo quiero reclamar
Ahora que puedo preguntar
A los que saben la verdad
A los que deben responder

Dónde está la poesia
Dónde están los que podian
Donde van las ilusiones
Dónde están las decisiones
Dónde están las alegrias
Que le hace falta a la vida

Dónde están los motivos
Y dónde está lo que digo

Florent Pagny,"Donde va la vida, la vida de adentro
La que va conmigo, la que esta en mi sueno
La vida que fluye de la que me invento
La vida que esconde tantos sentimientos

Donde va la vida, la que hacemos juntos
La de las miradas, la de las sonrisas, la de los segundos
La vida más suave, que controla todo
Mi poeta vida al mirar tus ojos

Donde va la vida, la que deja tiempo
La de los momentos que saben a vida, la que pasa lento
La vida con nombre, la vida sin miedo
La inocente vida de los que podemos

Pasa un ave sombre el mar
Pasa el rio en su caudal
Pasa el viento sin hablar y yo 
Antes que vuelva a pasar, esta vida, se te va
Se te va la vida, la vida se va

Donde va la vida, la vida que impone
La vida castigo por estar debajo de las decisiones
La pequeña vida, la que nadie mira
La que se confunde, la que no termina

Donde va la vida, la vida que muere 
Antes que la vida de la soluciones, la vida que hiere
La vida sin vida, que pasa de largo
La vida escondida detrás de un milagro

Donde está la vida, la que nos gastamos
La que merecemos, la que nos debemos, la que nos confiaron
La vida que vuelve sin dejarnos vida

Abriendo en cada puerta una verdad 
Yo soy quien va dejando atrás 
Tú entregas cada noche el alma 
¿Cómo llegar y no perder? 
Se enreda entre la suerte cada despertar 
Cristal de miel, agua de mar 
¡Despierta! El día llega y se nos va

Encore tes yeux, encore ton souffle
Encore ta main
Encore nous deux, encore heureux
Encore demain
Encore je t'aime, encore je suis
Encore c'est toi
Et puis encore, encore s'enfuir
Jusqu'à demain

Tocar la voz, borrar la piel 
Correr, volar, me salva 
Mirar tus manos tocando el mar 
Saber que sólo soy un árbol en la piedra 
Y tú te irás aún sin querer 
En un segundo hay tanto que te sobra 
Perdona mi viejo amor, mi carrusel 
Se está nublando el cielo, va a llover

Encore tes yeux, encore ton souffle
Encore ta main
Encore nous deux, encore heureux

Encore je t'aime, encore je suis
Encore c'est toi
Et puis encore, on va s'enfuir

Florent Pagny,"De papel o de ceniza
Como un cuento del abuelo 
Descubrí bajo el sombrero
Una tarde su sonrisa
A nadie se parecía
Al menos en la mirada
Jovencita de mil ganas 
Y otras miles prohibidas 
Y nos fuimos caminando entre risas y alborotos 
Y a su lado fui sonando entre sorpresas y rotos 

Habana, que espera 
Sentada en el balcón a que suba la marea
Habana tranquila 
Bañándose en el mar la luna siempre te mira 
Y yo

Me dijeron tantas cosas
De buenos y de villanos 
Pero al hablarte con las manos 
Se te enredan las razones 
Y luego la mente flota
Dicen que tiene un amante 
Pero prefiere estar sola
Tiene una luz que enamora 
Y un dolor en el semblante 
Y volvimos caminando 
Bien borrachos de alegría 
Pero no se todavía si ya fue
O está pasando

Habana se enciende
Jugando a enamorar
Jugando a ser diferente 
Habana desnuda
Pasiones de un lugar, donde la vida se fuma

Si la vas a enamorar, siente 
Si la quieres olvidar, no te enamores
Y si llegas a besar 
Terminas aprendiendo a respetar su suerte 

Habana cansada 
De volver a empezar 
Y de que no pase nada. 
Habana de noche, 
La magia de rodar 
Donde todos te conocen
 
Habana perdida
De música y de mar 
Pasiones y mentiras 
Habana se enciende
Jugando a enamorar
Jugando a ser diferente

Habana desnuda 
Pasiones de un lugar 
Donde la vida se fuma, se fuma
Donde la vida se fuma

Florent Pagny,"Otra vez tus ojos me dicen te amo y otra vez un beso 
Y otra vez las manos que quedan apretadas 
Decidiendo los sueños que llegaran mañana 
Otra vez se me olvida la mitad de la vida 
Y el silencio se instala y los miedos se pierden 
Y otra vez la ventana se ha quedado abierta 
Y otra vez yo contigo hasta que amanezca 

Otra vez los mismos cuentos largos 
Y otra vez nada empieza y otra vez yo me tardo 
Y me busco entre gritos que casi no me miran 
Y me pierdo entre mitos que deciden mi vida 
Y otra vez lo que acaba y otra vez la prisa 
Y otra vez el domingo encontró mi sonrisa 
Y yo me quedo sentado mirándote en la calma 
Que suerte de tenerte
Pa’ no perder la calma 
Pa’ no perder la calma

Agua salada 
Recorriendo los portales 
Agua salada que se mezcla con la brisa 
Se me empapa la camisa y crujen los ventanales 
Voy jugando a quien no sabe y me contagia tu risa 
Pa’ no perder la calma

Otra vez me descubro aturdido persiguiendo una idea 
Y otra vez la marea que cambia de sentido 
Y otra vez los que imponen y los que no se disculpan 
Y otra vez una culpa, un silencio y un miedo 
Y otra vez yo no puedo y otra vez no me toca 
Y otra vez me descubro debajo de mi ropa 
Aceptando idioteces y sueños que no quiero 
Y otra vez yo me digo al ver a mi fantasma 
Que suerte de tenerte
Pa’ no perder la calma 
Pa’ no perder la calma 

Agua salada, entre mis ojos claros 
Agua salada, en el beso que me has dado 
Tú te enredas con mis manos y yo me pierdo contigo 
Qué bueno que estás conmigo y suspirar a tu lado 

Pero otra vez tu te escondes y otra vez tú me niegas 
Y el corazón se me rompe 
Y otra vez el demonio 
Y otra vez esa gente 
Y otra vez tengo miedo, miedo de perderte 
Hasta otra vez sentir que sigues siendo mía 
Y perderme de nuevo entre tu fantasía 
Como hay que darle al alma, con tal de no perderse

Florent Pagny,"Finalmente hoy, algo se acaba y algo empieza
Pienso que en verdad, tampoco lo hemos hecho mal
Tenia que llegar, porque el camino siempre da la vuelta
Finalmente hoy, ya nos volvemos a encontrar

Vamos a escapar, sin rumbo sin motivo
Quiero caminar, tomar el aire frió

Tanto tiempo que se va, en un solo giro
Volvemos a empezar, de nuevo el camino
Pero sobra paz, y me falta el ruido
Una musica de mas, cambiando de lugar
Sin ningún sentido

Finalmente aqui, ahora nos sobra el silencio
Quitare el reloj no necesito mas el tiempo
Vamos a escapar sin rumbo, sin sentido
Tengo que salir, tomar el aire frió

Todo el tiempo que se va en un solo instante
Volvemos a empezar sin saber como era antes
Si me falta el dolor, y me falta el ruido
Una musica que va cambiando de lugar
Sin ningún sentido

Tanto tiempo que se va
Al pasar la puerta
Y ya nunca volvera
Solo se recuerda
Tengo que esperar y ver, pero falta el ruido
Y la musica se ira, y el dolor se acabara
Y el silencio llegara
Sin motivos",Falta El Ruido,2016
Florent Pagny,"Se despertó con los ojos apretados a la cara, y se encontró
Se levantó con lo poco de verdad que le quedaba, y decidió

Esto no puede seguir, me estoy cortando las alas
Esto no puede seguir, ni siquiera hasta mañana, ni siquiera hasta mañana

Buscaré los sueños que perdí
Volveré porque no encuentro nada, todo se acaba
Viviré porque es mejor así
Porque a mí me da la gana, porque a mí me da la gana

Un día encontró que hay montones de colores que no faltan y quiso ver
Le pareció haber inventado el mundo que faltaba y decidió

Esto tiene que seguir, nada cortara mis ganas
Quiero andar donde no sé, quiero ir donde me llaman
Ya veré qué hago mañana

Y dejo los sueños por ahí
Se escondió de su propia mirada, que lo de hallaba
Y se fue tan lejos que no vio como el tiempo se acabada, todo el tiempo que pasaba

Buscares los sueños que perdí
Volveré porque no encuentro nada, todo se acaba
Viviré porque es mejor vivir

Porque a mí me da la gana
Porque a mí me da la gana",Viviré,2016
Florent Pagny,"Un letrero la pared
Y una calle sin final 
Un secreto en la distancia 
La sombra de lo que fue 
Una cabaña detrás
Solo sus manos me alcanzan 

Y me quedé sin saber 
Y me quedé sin hablar 
Pero se me que fui feliz 

Recostado a la pared 
Sin más nada que ofrecer 
Nos contamos esperanzas 
Creo que el amanecer 
Sin palabras sin café 
Los mentimos en la cama

Y me sentí respirar 
Recostada junto a mi 
Lo demás vendrá mañana 

Porque 
Hay que volar otra vez 
Volverlo a intentar
Confiar en los sueños 
Hay que cambiarse la piel 
Reír sin parar
Meterse en el centro 

Hay que intentar otra vez 
Volver a cantar 
Sin prisa y sin miedo 
Hay que querer ser feliz 
Ganar o perder es parte del juego 
Parte de mi 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Veo la gente pasar
Me da gusto comprender 
Que nadie vivido todo 
Siempre busca la ilusión 
Que te vuelve a despertar 
Y que te llene de ganas 
Luego sigue por ahí 
Intentando ser feliz 
Los demás vendrá mañana

Me pierdo un poco en el juego 
De quererte enamorar 
Trato de hacer lo que puedo 
Tu sonríes desde lejos 
Y no se disimular 

En intentar no soy bueno 
Y a veces me desespero 
Siempre me gusta ganar 
Tu siempre sales delante 
Con tu mirada elegante 
Yo tan poco natural 

Ay mira que me gusta todos 
Los colores claros, tu melancolía 
Ay mira que nada me importa 
Más que tus secretos, tu fantasía 
Qué bueno estar a tu lado, mi amor 
Y ver pasar la vida 
Luego cantarte tu bolero mi amor
Hasta que llegue el día 

Yo con mi voz de bolero 
Siempre algo lo que más quiero 
Tan poco me va mal
Me gusta ver la mañana 
Quedarme un rato en la cama 
Y sentirte respirar 

Aunque el día no sea bueno 
Salgo a buscarte y te espero 
Para poderme escapar 
Entre tu boca y tu pelo 
Con mis ganas y sin miedo 
Nadie nos puede parar

Ay mira que me gustan todas

Florent Pagny,"D'où vient le bonheur, où poussent les rêves 
La lueur de nos coeurs quand le jour se lève 
Où se cache l'amour quand il dort? 
Il y a tant de choses qu'on ignore 
Est-ce-qu'il faut choisir une vie sans ratures 
Ou écrire sans relire, suivre l'aventure 
Le futur nous joue des accords 
Qu'on ne peut pas connaître encore 
Il m'a fallut des voyages et des mirages pour être sûr de moi 
Aujourd hui je sais que je ne sais pas 

Ne me demande pas où se trouve le droit chemin 
Même si chacun a le sien personne ne connaît sa route 
Et c'est la beauté du doute 
Si tu perds un combat, donne à ta vie d'autres chances 
Personne ne connaît d'avance tous les parfums que l'on goûte

Où vont nos prières, où fini le ciel 
Qui écoute le long des routes quand nos voix se mêlent?
On chante une mélodie fragile 
On avance perdus dans la file 
Le passé nous suit, on le voit de loin 
Bien caché, est-ce-qu'il sait ce qu'il y a demain?
Il nous faut renoncer parfois 
Pour trouver le meilleur en soi
Il t'en faudra des errances 
Des nuits qui dansent

Les couleurs de nos villes, les douleurs ou les envies 
On comprendra plus tard

Que tu as une dent contre tout

Et on s'en rend compte après coup 

Trace une ligne une route sur l'abîme 
Un espoir que plus rien ne décime 
On dit que nos destins sont écrits 
Moi je dis qu'on les dessine 
Les défis ce sont des lignes blanches

Cette fille, c’est l’obscurité qui t'allume 
Mais ne la suis pas sous la lune 
Alors que le soleil t'attend 
Ce cri c'est l'amour qu'on donne c'est l'ivresse 
Si tu pardonnes à ta jeunesse 
Elle te rendra tous tes printemps 

Trace, sans rétro même si le chemin tremble 
Un horizon qui te ressemble 
Les distances pourraient nous éloigner 
Mais moi je dis qu'elles nous rassemblent 
Les folies sont des lignes en couleur 
Qui maquillent les coups et les douleurs 
Et si ton cœur sans voix manque d'estime

Il faut qu'il meurt qu'il meurt d'amour

Le jour se lève la nuit pâlit
Les chasseurs et les chiens ont faim
C'est l'heure de sonner l'hallali
La bête doit mourir ce matin
Je vais ouvrir grand mes volets
Crevez-moi le coeur je suis prêt
Je veux m'endormir pour toujours
Près d'elle

Je n'étais qu'un fou mais par amour
Elle a fait de moi un fou, un fou d'amour
Mon ciel c'était ses yeux, sa bouche
Ma vie c'était son corps, son corps
Je l'aimais tant 
Que pour la garder je l'ai tuée

Je ne suis qu'un fou, qu'un fou d'amour
Un pauvre fou
Qui meurt
Qui meurt d'amour",Requiem pour un fou,2017
Florent Pagny,"Pour tout bagage on a vingt ans
On a l'expérience des parents
On se fout du tiers comme du quart
On prend l'bonheur toujours en retard
Quand on aime c'est pour toute la vie
Cette vie qui dure l'espace d'un cri
D'une permanente ou d'un blue jean
Et pour le reste on imagine
Pour tout bagage on a sa gueule
Quand elle est bath ça va tout seul
Quand elle est moche on s'habitue
On s'dit qu'on est pas mal foutu
On bat son destin comme les brèmes
On touche à tout on dit je t'aime
Qu'on soit d'la Balance ou du Lion
On s'en balance on est des lions

Pour tout bagage on a vingt ans
On a des réserves de printemps
Qu'on jetterait comme des miettes de pain
À des oiseaux sur le chemin
Quand on aime c'est jusqu'à la mort
On meurt souvent et puis on sort
On va griller une cigarette
L'amour ça s'prend et puis ça s'jette
Pour tout bagage on a sa gueule
Qui cause des fois quand on est seul
C'est c'qu'on appelle la voix du dedans
Ça fait parfois un d'ces boucans
Pas moyen de tourner le bouton
De cette radio on est marron
On passe à l'examen de minuit
Et quand on pleure on dit qu'on rit

Pour tout bagage on a vingt ans
On a une rose au bout des dents
Qui vit l'espace d'un soupir
Et qui vous pique avant d'mourir
Quand on aime c'est pour tout ou rien
C'est jamais tout c'est jamais rien
Ce rien qui fait sonner la vie
Comme un réveil au coin du lit
Pour tout bagage on a sa gueule
Devant la glace quand on est seul
Qu'on ait été chouette ou tordu
Avec les ans tout est foutu
Alors on maquille le problème
On s'dit qu'y'a pas d'âge pour qui s'aime
Et en cherchant son cœur d'enfant
On dit qu'on a toujours vingt ans",20 Ans,2018

Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love

 I can't believe ya

 Like Häagen-Dazs you hit the spot 
 You make me scream 
 Cause you got a lot 
 In your Calvin jeans 
 You're a beauty queen 
 And you're blowin' my mind 
 Just one look was all it took, I'm shook

 Got a body like 
 A dancer on MTV 
 I'd spend all my ends 
 To hold you close to me 
 You're the sexiest woman alive 
 Oh babe it's so insane 
 You work that body 
 Like you're on Soul Train 
 You've got the stuff 
 That make a guy do most anything

 When you walk into a room

 Every guy around just wants to sweat ya

 Though I've tasted all the finer things 
 I never had a time like you 
 I like the way we touch in the night

Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear",Spring Is Here,2016

y yo te voy a esperar
y no me voy a pintar
yo se que te gusto mucho
cuando me ves natural

y llegare tan puntual,
no quiero perder mas tiempo
Cada segundo que tardas
es un beso que te resto

Me pondre el vestido azul
que se que te gusta mas
Dejare mi pelo suelto
para que baile en el viento

y en nuestra esquina de siempre
el aire se ha perfumado
Porque en todas las ventanas
el amor se esta asomando

Estribillo:
Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y mi vestido azul se me arrugo
y esta esquina, no es mi esquina
y este amor, ya no es mi amor

Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y yo jamas sabre lo que paso
Me fui llorando despacio
me fui dejando el corazon

y me robaste la esquina,
y me quede tan perdida
A donde vuelan mis sueños?
a un callejon sin salida

y me quite mi vestido,
que tanto te gustaba
Total me siento desnuda,
total ya no tengo nada

Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y mi vestido azul se me arrugo
y esta esquina, no es mi esquina
y este amor, ya no es mi amor

Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y yo jamas sabre lo que paso

I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

Gravel dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rear view
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of Dixieland Delight
High as the stars, in the Milky Way
Those summer days, drifting away, she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

July flames, October ashes
Southern skin and blue jean flashes
Strike a match and light a memory
We never said goodbye, we let it fly into thin air
Tonight I'm stoned, on long gone love so strong, I swear I'm

Florida Orchestra,"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto:  ""In God is our trust.""

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

You'll soon wish you could die...it can be arranged...

You weren't the first and won't be the last,

You gambled honor for pleasure, a wager that cost precious trust.

Whom we're taught to fear from day number one.
The beguiling serpent, king of the underworld,
Betrayer and mocker of heaven's chosen one.

Ultimate deceiver; longing to take you in.
He promises earthly glory, if you play his game;
""I won't let the firebombs hurt you, just
Number your head and take my name.""

Belial begins his scheming, treacherous plan,
Turns brother on brother, toys with the leaders of man.
He creates before them illusions of broken truce,
A wicked plot of deception, that commanders cannot refuse.
In a short time he has control,
USA, Russia, chaos from pole to pole.
Mankind's worst nightmare, it's too late to pray,
Hold tight and take your last breath,
The missiles are on their way...DOOMSDAY!

All over the earth the horror begins,
This time there's no second chance.
Firebombs...deathly flash, vapors spread so fast,
In a moment the world is ash.
There in the midst stands the deceiver
Bearing a brooding smile.
Surrounded by his marked believers,
The masses of unscarred.

Evil's reign, called by the prophets,
Under a darkened sky,
Ghastly sins everywhere, unmarked survivors
Sacrificed as demons dance.
Suddenly, the hordes are silenced,
By the rumbling planed, metalbeast soon to appear,
To challenge the enemy, to deal his doom,
To write the devil's dirge...Doomsday!

The scorched ground opens, the beast of metal appears,
Satan and his army show no sign of fear.
Across desert plains, through city streets,
In the hills evil meets defeat.
Covens one by on fall by metal's hand,
As the dark forces weaken.
The monster rages through the battles,
To confront the master of sin.

As the night falls, the beasts, they meet
And the existing numbered line along the street.
The air is charged with power metal,
Flotzilla's eyes glow as he feeds.
The clash begins, a fight 'til death,
Such power never seen before.
Thrashing jaws, slashing claws,
Dealing the darkside's fate;
The deceiver's doom this day...DOOMSDAY!

When she saw what she had done, she gave her father forty-one.

To shock you and capture your holes
The victims before us, words can't describe
The kind you seize only in your dreams
Her striking glance tells the story
The lust in her mind is plain to see
She knows that I know what she's thinking
Thinking of poisoning me

Poison me - snakes that bite - poison me

The time for gashing has come now
The reptile slithers to me
Just one more persuasion
Her cold blood boils from the heat
Penetration, injection is painless
Forked-tongue flicking about
A constrictor in the form of a woman
With such a grip I barely got out!

I'll poison you with my venom
Come to me, Viper and see

The pounding and banging is done

When for my venom, again you will come",U.L.S.W.,1986

Been played by young and old for oh, so many years
Can you tell me honestly you've never been a pawn?
Someone steals your love away, you turn around, they're gone

It is the game of temptation
It is the play of the heart
Cry out in desperation
Iron tears take you apart

Love to you is lies to me

Love is cruel and lies cut deep

This time reverse the pain that brought upon your fears
This time forget the part about broken hearts and tears
Come on, take command, show no mercy, cruel and cold

My love for you is lies, you see
Iron tears
Love is cruel and lies cut deep

Iron tears, the tears you cry
Are tears enough for all
Iron tears, the tears I cry
Are tears enough for all

Now you know just how it feels from both sides of the heart
Do you like the tearing, or to be torn apart?
What do you feel inside when you bleed a soul?
What do you want from love, mercy or control?

Cry out in desperation
Iron tears take you apart

No one to reach out to, for you to call your own.

The mask is gone, no more to hide, the face of fate you kept inside.
Against the odds you stayed alive, to rebuild this fatal mess,

Errors kept under lock and key

Bustling nations horde their rotting wheat,
Bloated tribesmen wither in the heat.

Kiddnapping extortion oil money spent.

Thompson bullet holes, shred into the suits.
Under table oath, now in a pact.

Will there be no place to hide when the storm comes down
To tear off my hide, defenseless, rich or poor
When the wolves start gathering round my door
Self-destructed, I never anticipated
Such pain from the things that I've created

Burn down the lies and the hatred in my eyes
Let it burn, burn to see the world turn
And it's all there in front of me

Betrayer and mocker of heaven's chosen one.

Ultimate deceiver; longing to take you in.
He promises earthly glory, if you play his game;
""I won't let the firebombs hurt you, just
Number your head and take my name.""

Turns brother on brother, toys with the leaders of man.

Bearing a brooding smile.
Surrounded by his marked believers,
The masses of unscarred.

Under a darkened sky,
Ghastly sins everywhere, unmarked survivors
Sacrificed as demons dance.
Suddenly, the hordes are silenced,
By the rumbling planed, metalbeast soon to appear,
To challenge the enemy, to deal his doom,
To write the devil's dirge...Doomsday!

Satan and his army show no sign of fear.
Across desert plains, through city streets,
In the hills evil meets defeat.
Covens one by on fall by metal's hand,
As the dark forces weaken.
The monster rages through the battles,
To confront the master of sin.

As the night falls, the beasts, they meet
And the existing numbered line along the street.
The air is charged with power metal,
Flotzilla's eyes glow as he feeds.

Dealing the darkside's fate;

Turn on the faucet...mm-hmm
Uh-huh (x5)
You and you throw your hands up
If you in the back come on, throw your hands up
If you in the front, you can throw your hands up
If you on the side, you can throw your hands up
Wave 'em in the sky, you can throw your hands up
Yo its aiight if you want to throw your hands up
You and you and you could throw your hands up
Cause its the be	-double-ooh
be	-double-oh, this is how we do
On the regular oh-ooh, you know who
Uh-huh (x3)

[Buckshot]

Yo there used to be a rumor about BDI
I wouldn't come back, I tell you no lie
But when I listen to the radio I think
Whenever I'm back, I'm bound to make a link
With the music that used to make me jam and jump
Thump while the bass bump
Tellin BJ throw on the wax that's playin the Therapy mix
You said it was aiight, we made a remix
Licks after licks take ticks
Of the time clock
be	-D-Buck a shot, uh, take it to the top
See I'm bound to make your body pop
One nation under a groove, so my beat'll never stop
When I heard about the beef between the East and the West coast
Called my nigga Kurupt, I knew it was boast
They hope a nigga in the music with this bomb
So I prepare load my arms
And wait, cause its the last time

Chorus [F.L.O.W.]

This is the last time i will
Ever struggle
This is the last time i will
Ever fall

[BJ Swan]

My moms gotta take in second-hand bum smoke 
Just to keep from breakin, goin broke
And if you read my diary it'd break your heart
Cause I been losin like a mutherfucka from the start
Excuse me--but that's the only way that I can express
My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair 
For real

Chorus (x2)

[Steele]

Eyes watch as I make moves
Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I ain't sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my be	 and see
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time 
I'm sure

Flow Master Hip Hop,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing

It's all about
The phat and perfect family
We make 'em jazzy
And make 'em parlez all the way
The kind of flows
That shake the hottest towns
We make the hottest sounds
And make the parties bounce

Joe&Phlowtron:
It's the infamous freak
And venomous Jizzow
We hold on
With Supafreak and AtomdaBomb
From Phlowtron
This how we do(this is how we do)
Yo,you best listen proper
On a Phat fam trip
With more kicks
Than foot locker
Your boots been rocking
Keeping it up in this mother
Your style's fake
Like it get sarcasm
Every time you knock her
It's urgent for us to be
Submerging from the underworld
We the chosen ones
You don't believe me
Ask the oracle
Read the chironicles of this
Mad rapper slash whoever
Yo we fam?
Yeah we fam
And keep it
Through this endeavour
This mission we ain't preaching
Just need to split some knowledge
Time to put fake noise
Wise in cold storage
We beyond
It's your time
You think you Hispanic
We think you charlatanic
Just chilling don't panic
Ain't no beef in this brother
The styles remain unheard of
Too Phat and Phlowtron
We taking this further

Malique & Phlowtron:
Yo what's your name(Malique)
And what you representing
Too Phat
I heard a lot of songs
The filling you now
I'd say now it's too bad
It's poetry of myself
And those cast that filling me
Like all your fans
No doubt
What you seem to hear
Squealing me
The stress is killing me
But remain the trendsetter
Like when push comes
To hold ups jeans
You should know better
A 13th letter song
She never yawn
To remind you of my name
Every time you be counting
One,two
No question
I got some assumption
Now an era of submission
On this repercussion
I superscript patch on
Equipped and all ready
Then everybody best believe
That you fly
Like I was R.Kelly
Yeah,I think this someâ??really
It's revolutionary
When we blow up spots
You know my style unheard of
It's Phat Fam
Representing on the slow song
Malique locking the down with me

Coz MOB's coming for ya
Holla at me
If you wanna battle(battle)

As I running into the club
Give it up just stop
Don't think you're on top
Gotta be the one
Who's making it pop
Telling you a bit about
That's how we roll

Gotta stick to the plan
Caught a chick do that thang
Better keep to my slang
Got a gig to be hang
Rather be with my friends
Got you sick when I sang
Would you stick to my fang
Bet you flip I say so

Better be prepared
With a red carpet
Gotta move my steps
Taking off your hat
Show me some respect
Doing as I said
Everything's the fact
Flip that and so we roll

the Tarik Crew:
Save the best for last
Coming through
The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines
That we be quoting
Exploding
We leave the venue
With the stage broken
That no sugar coating
Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow
The rhyming prose
With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

Floyd Cramer,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Floyd Cramer,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

Heard they crowded the floor

Floyd Cramer,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song (The Hands of Time),1975

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

And acrobatics I'm superstar status, the mouth of the South like gangsta grillz you bastard,
The international traveler, and I may not be much to you but I'm the sh*t out in Africa,
So put ya fist up, even the statue of liberty lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up,
You can't compete wit me, I got 'em stuck like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet wit me,
And then I broke free, I'll let 'em loose when Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free,
I'm the baddest mother shut it like Shaft was, leavin' rappers wit headaches like bad drugs,
They shoulda warned ya, you got defeated by the heat but,eh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya,
So Cater coroner, I'll show up to yo funeral wit some gators like I'm fresh outta Florida,
Call me the swamp thing, yall headed in the wrong direction like you hit the subway and caught the wrong train,
So don't fuck wit it, I'm sendin' lyrical bullets right at ya dome fuck niggaz betta duck wit it,
Or else you stuck wit it,
You'll get stalked so bad you'll leava da scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it,

A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm

Leave your guns at home Bill

And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill

And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

But the stranger drew his gun and fired

To go and listen

But for the wrath of my lyrical chi devastating capabilities
Strike mercilessly
Indoctrinated mind under total control
Acidic stranglehold to erode and
Destroy opposing foes
Thinking freeflows
Choreograph like ballets
Capable of disguising true purpose needs and intent
So swift
One thought could crumple the sham defenses
The degree of the stringent rhyme-fu master intense is
Flowing ideals of immense fortified understanding
Expressly demanding lyrical wildfire fanning
Senses so acute distinguished through objects and portals

Seen bandwidth through online zenith mandates

Deliver checkmate

I fuckin' zealously adhere

Pray upon your gods to bring you fertile ground and plentiful bounty
Just so you could hold a feast for him
While your stomach is still growling
Still howling at the moon
For release from the streets to which your doomed

Inclined destiny
Master design will unfold in due time
In the blueprints of my mind
Behind the blockade I'm confined

I have nothing
Am nothing
Need nothing
Born into a world of suffering
And my veins burst so I bleed nothing
Breathe nothing
Find love of nothing
Plant a seed a nothing
Breed nothings
Whose nothing hearts will beat nothing

Disease begins to fester and call the antidote heathens
Through prosthetic inquisitions the world is enveloped in
A gripping sin a damned kin
We just call it passing trends
True power comes from inside and is expressed through instincts
Some have found the missing piece
But others call it resisting
Zygotes of polyurethane in a cervix copper lining
The body's seeming wiring controlled by a cyber ring
Now we raise children in a vessel-like incubator
What happens when someone trips the cable or overloads the generator?

[Hook with Scratches]",Pray,2004
Fluent,"Check me out right here yo

Stone carved sonnets
Set in Tibet written in onyx marks the coming of a comet
Which rides a Fluent prophet
To stop shit that fake shit I'm a take shit back
Progressive movements in tune with a makeshift match

Raisin' an army
Fighting over radio stations which one day might play some conscious emancipation
For the duration of this ego glorified monopolized disguised disgrace in front of ya face
Lackin' pride
They hidin' behind jewels and riches
I know the malignant foolish festering played out ungifted
Especially when capitalists are evading taxes
While we're breaking our backs and getting burnt faster than matchsticks

This is for my true heads dancing with the dead
For whatever reason falling short of success
Gotta test the bounds of excess before you see what's next
don't ponder to the extent
You will know when you're not vexed

Some can't handle so they get dropped quick
Off labels only props they get is in Saturday Night Live skits
Then off buildings for tryin to diss me this and that
Kidnapped they kids like I was starrin' in fuckin Parent Trap

Lastly off the map
Dig a hole deep enough
Floating in the middle of the earth with all the others who were wack
Sorry dog you kissed ass to get to the top
But when I signed on your album flopped and you got laid off

[Hook, 2X]
Who are you to try and be true
The fact is you define what wack is
I'm long overdue for appearances
This lyricist is redefining game
Every vein and membrane is cold in steel that you can't stain

Next verse
Deadly like the first
Like a hearse carrying a mourns in the fucking hurts
The loss the heartache the high priced funeral
The casket or ashes in an urn whatever's suitable

Am I offensive or do I just say what you don't like?
Say what you don't want to hear magnified through a mic
Inter-correctional 23 hour lockdowns
Release the fuckin' hounds they found in empty cell pound

Get free
Drown the sorrows with a high proof bottle
I'm sitting writing in the grotto with no positive role models
All criminal and psychopathic individuals gather for the residual of their municipal

Supposedly indivisible but divided by the livest survivors
From tribes who recruit hardcore connivers

The number one don gotta' make it hotter than a sauna
in a summer in Nevada wearin' four layers of datta

Another lyrical miracle making your fearful
Frenzied by this imperial
Givin' you an earful

I crush hype with my grip like a vice
My salivas' kerosene 
My words are the light
So I ignite mics

And when the times right and the beats sick
I create such appetising rhymes
You wish that you could eat it

The collegiate quadriplegic with theories and postulates
Wordly Theory couldn't disprove or not believe in

[Hook]

Re-circulated and re-prioritized
I'm the sorta guy that you distributors immortalize
So fuckin' fortified I can't be moved 
Glorified to the extent I never get booed or loose

Unlocked never keep the fuckin' safety on
Gnawed through my muzzle
Now I'm known from here to the great beyond

Attack the central nervous and immune systems
You got acute symptoms of another fuckin' stool pigeon

Ya'll watchin' TV I'm readin' Neitzche
Bein' examined in the lab as a new species
Ruthless flow till my mouth is fuckin' toothless
If I had toothpicks in my gums or vomiting mucas

Cunning and well versed but overlooked and even worse
I'm cursed by the demonic church makin' me work

Dynamic planned and standin' for the follow up
Already heated because I already swallowed the bottle up

My mind is journeyin' through come-up plots
A have not in the late night on a mad block poppin' off pad locks

I'm steppin' on toes like they was wearin' sandles
The entire fuckin' Florida panhandle can't handle

Go ahead I insist
I got the fiscal year fixed
My fist pierces like poison dipped arrow tips
These logistics are scientific magnificent
Genetically enhanced and engineered
Guaranteed infinite

Two color charms, hand stand blueish. 
Shorty in the passenger side singing foolish. 
Go by the crew ship, blinking on the aven boom. 
Shorty's aroma, it's that new shit. 
That's the ride done. 
Said you don't want to feel the bass in your stomach. 
You on cause you off shit.

Early morning fresh, 
Know you fucking with the best. 
Can barely see your steps, 
You just gotta say yes. 
Alarm clock rings, 
An empty cooler door. 
Smoke hit the ceiling, 
Let the ashes hit the floor.

Throwing loose ones in the brown paper bag.
I'm burning through funds cause life is such a drag. (x4)

For all of y'all keepin young and hell, 
Just to live life and enjoy yourself. 
'Cause it's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go,

Just a young boy out of public housing. 
They say I wouldn't make it, 
Now I'm styling. 
Man for couldn't stand crystal violence. 
With that rumor cookie falling. 
You had my support, don't you want to spend. 
Spend some want support. 
I got a dark past and a bright future, 
So if you got nothing to do run the room. 
If you heard I fuck your bitch I probably run with you. 
I swear that thing came out on top, 
Can't cut right thing. 
All my niggas looking good and they just want. 
Even got my homie stylin while she cursing.

My poppas such ill I wonder who raised me. 
My younger gone now he fin to have a baby. 
For now you can call me uncle smack a hoe.

Something warm that I could say

Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes

Watching ships out in the bay
And I swallow so hard
Am I too weak to fight?
As the day becomes the night

I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how do I feel

Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more

And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty

I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

When I was a very small girl
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see

That's the price that we all pay
Our valued destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was no way of knowing

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty

The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
