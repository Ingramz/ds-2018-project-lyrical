Dean Martin,"Gee but it's great after being out late
Walking my baby back home
Arm and arm over meadow and farm
Walking my baby back home
We go along harmonizing a song
Or I'm reciting a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walking my baby back home
We stop for awhile she gives me a smile
Snuggles her head to my chest
We started to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest
After I kind of straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walking my baby back home
La la la dee la la la dee
Know she's afraid of the dark
So I have to park
Right outside the door 'til it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
So I dry her tears off all through the night
La la la dee la la la dee
We stop for awhile she gives me a smile
Snuggles her head to my chest
We started to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest
After I kind of straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walking my baby back home

Each thrill beside you so worth waiting for

Into the deep blue sky
And when I think of home

With loving tears in your eyes

And as I sailed away with a longing to stay
I promised I'd be true and love only you

Just dream away
The dawn will light a bright new day
Be cheerful in your sleepy time prayer

Where stars above fall in your hand
And some day we'll find this where and when
Bonne nuit 'til then

Dean Martin,"Hangin' around with you
Wonderful thing to do
Having a time the moment that I'm with you
Finding a love so true
Something I never knew
Something I found just hangin' around with you

Taking a flier around the blue
Floating through space
Traveling higher than heaven's door
Locked in your sweet embrace
Nothing but loving you
Beautiful thing for two
Paradise found just hangin' around with you

Hangin' around with you
Wonderful thing to do
Having a time the moment that I'm with you

I ran all the way home
Just to hold you in my arms dear

Dean Martin,"Never before has my heart felt a thrill like this
Never before
Never before
Never before has the whole world stood still like this
As I gaze at the face I simply adore
After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime
The miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this

",Never Before,2002
Dean Martin,"To be loved is a thrilling sensation as thrilling as can be
Though it happens in every nation they greet if differently
Every mademoiselle with pasoolala, every Englishman talks to his pater
Every spittin' Venetian goes tra la la and the Irish say Mother McCree
But when I look at you and I thrill like I do there is only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine

(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)
But when they approach you I'll keep them in line
By telling them oh boy oh boy oh boy you're mine

Certain characters hi-diddle-diddle when cupid comes along
Some mechanics shift gears in the middle and drummers kick the gong
Every cowboy I know hollers yipee
Every clown in the circus goes oopla
Every sailor in port hollers anchors aweigh
And an Indian gives you a ugg!
But when you hold me tight like you're doing tonight
There's only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine
(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye , the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)

Dean Martin,"Until you find the one you want to want you
Until you find her eyes constantly haunt you
Until no other lips can ever thrill you
You'll never know the glory of a heart in love
Until you're swept away with an emotion
As high as stars above, as great as the ocean
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you

As high as stars above)
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true

Below and every day you lose other you

Step ladder, you climb the other way

Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues (Reprise),2003

And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

Italians love to sip a cup of cappuccino
And listen to the man who plays the mandolino
You offer him a cigarette a glass of wine
That's how he's paid to serenade your lady fair

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

He seems like such a happy man, the man who plays the mandolino
He sings a song of sweet romance for all the lovers as they dance
But all he's holding in his arms is just a little mandolino
He has no woman of his own so every night he walks alone

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

(And while he's strumming songs of love the man who plays the mandolino)
(His eyes are always looking for a senorina to adore)
He drinks a toast to his true love each time he lifts a glass of vino
And so until that lucky day he looks for her along the way

And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

And my heart begins to break

But you said goodbye to me
Now all I can do is grieve
Can it be that you forgot?

And leave this heart that's broken

And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute
In a bikini suit

Oh how they sing of the good, good old days

They couldn't swing in the good old days

Come take me, I'm yours how happy
I would be to beg or borrow or sorrow with you
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through
If we drift apart then I'll be lost alone

I look at her and I say to myself
There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

I feel so proud I could shout to the crowd
There's my lover
But the crowd mustn't know
For I mustn't show my love

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me
Oh, but the Fates have blessed me

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her

There is my first love, my last love, my all

Be it right, be it wrong

 Know I love her 
 Know I care 
 But my dreams, like the songs, she sang in Spanish 
 Seem to vanish

On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing, right within your heart

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet

Accustomed to her face

She's second nature to me now

Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

Twine around the door

Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early

And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.

For only a day
I'd make a wish

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day,

Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)

If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)

The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
you hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)

For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)

He's got a way that makes you buy

Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.
And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
Then they did know assuredly

Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.
Then entered in those wise men three,

Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are OK
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last
Gotta take that one last ride

Deana Carter,"He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still  remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Deana Carter,"If you get out in the drivin' rain
Stand in the eye of the hurricane
And never think twiceIf you turn your back on selfishness
Cause your thougts are for someone else
Cause they've changed your life
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
When you heart insists that you give it all
When you no longer fear the fall
And you just let go
When the past is finally dead and gone
Fate leads you somewhere to the one
That has your soul
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough

No part of you questions
No part of you doubts
You're only sure this is what love's about
And nothing and no one can stand in your way
Or keep you from saying
What your heart is dying to say

I don't have to turn away
I don't have to look down
If I should see you with somebody new
Well I might get sentimental

Puts the shadow of doubt

We were so in love, we were so in love

But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh la la la la la la la oh

Come along with me, come on and dance with me

When you smile with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

And nothings lost at such a cost

Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?

In a blanket with her name written on a note

On a Greyhound

She got out for a smoke and they drove away

I snuck down the stairs and peaked around the door
Our living room was a dance floor

Saw Santa boogie woogie Christmas night
That tinsel on our Christmas tree turned into neon lights
He was shaking his suit from side to side
I could not believe my eyes
Santa boogie woogie Christmas night

All at once his fingers started to snap
And that jolly old man put down his bag
He was doing the swim and clapping his hands
He transformed into a moon walking man

(Boogie woogie, Santa boogie woogie)
That tinsel on our Christmas tree turned into neon lights
He was shaking his suit from side to side
I could not believe my eyes

I heard the elves say
""Santa, we've got work to do""
""Chill out, man, I'm busting a move""
""What about all the other kids""
""Ho ho, ho ho, you're right, we better go""

Waiting for your world to turn around is less likely to be found
As I watch it moving past
Than any other hope that I might hold that someday you
Might know what it's like to slowly drown
Waiting for your world to turn around
Waiting for the the thought to cross your mind that 2 hearts might
Be inclined to commit an act that's bold
Or even just be looking for a chance to take advantage of
One glance and live inside it one more time
Waiting for the thought to cross your mind
How long will it be
'Til these blind eyes can finally see
I don't know, time goes so slow
While your love, like a river, flows right by me
Waiting for your world to turn around is less likely to be found

Might know what it's like to slowly drown

Let me see you get together,

I have squandered my resistance,
For a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises.
All lies and jest.
Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy,
In the company of strangers,
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared.
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters,
Where the ragged people go.
Lookin' for the places, only they would know.

Lie-da-lie ...

Asking only workman's wages I come lookin' for a job,
But I get no offers,
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue.
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome,
I took some comfort there.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?

Makes me stop just before I begin

And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,

And every time your lips meet mine

I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

All her lovely companions are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown

Swinging in a blossom laden tree
But tell me bluebird
Will there be happiness for me?

Will I discover Someone to care for me?
A perfect lover to hold me tenderly?
Will someone ever sing me A love song while we dance?
Will the music bring me romance?

Will there be someone Whenever skies are gray
To kiss my lonely tears away?
And will that someone be all I dreamed my love would be
Someone to care for me?

Deanna Durbin,"Well, they're strollin' in the gloamin',
When the roses are in bloom.
A soldier and his sweetheart, brave and true.
And their hearts are filled with sorrow,
For their thoughts are of tomorrow,
As she pins a rose upon his coat of blue.

""Do not ask me, love, to linger,
""When you know not what to say.
""For duty calls your sweetheart's name again.
""And your heart need not be sighing,
""That I'll be among the dying.
""I'll be with you when the roses bloom again.""

When the roses bloom again,
And the sun is on the river:
The Mockingbird will sing it's sweet refrain.
And in the days of Auld Lang Syne,
I'll be with you, sweetheart mine.
Oh, I'll be with you when the roses bloom again.

With the rattle of the battle,
Came a whisper soft and low:
""Our soldier, he is fallen in the fray.""
""I am dying, I am dying,
""And I know I've got to go,
""But I wanna tell you before I pass away.""

""There's a far and distant river,
""Where the roses are in bloom,
""And a sweetheart who is waiting there for me.
""And it's there, I pray you'll take me.
""I'll be faithful, don't forsake me.
""I'll be with you when the roses bloom again.""

Deanna Durbin,"'Tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?
This bleak world alone","The Last Rose of Summer, song [From Three Smart Girls Grow Up]",2002

Deanna Durbin,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know What heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine","Begin the Beguine [From ""Hers to Hold""]",2008

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow

But when he come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.

A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Deanna Witkowski,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,2005
DeAnne Arnold,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2001

Dear Jack ,"Fuori ancora piove
La mia mente adesso naviga
Verso nuove realtà
Mi chiedo, ora dove sei?
Se tra le mie mani un giorno tu sarai
Anima gemella

Non so neanche se tu esisti
M'immagino il sapore
Tra le labbra che tu lasci
Non bastano parole
E ancora il tuo sorriso
Luminoso come il sole
Che abbraccia coi suoi raggi
Una semplice canzone

Dimmi chi sei
Forse non lo saprò mai
Se sei una tipa coi suoi spazi (guardi il viso t'imbarazzi)
Bevi latte a colazione (entri dentro le persone)

Ora penso al tuo aspetto
I capelli rossi sulle spalle scendono
Mentre fissi il nulla
Immagino d'inverno le mani fredde (sulla schiena)
Poi l'estate tu che mangi e ridi (con la bocca piena)
Non è facile pensarti
Come un sogno e niente più

Natale coi parenti (a sgranocchiare il panettone)
Poi tornare a casa finalmente (a coccolarci ore e ore)
E dopo fatto l'amor
Un film è di garanzia
Dimmi anima gemella
Se un giorno sarai mia

Dimmi chi sei
Forse non lo saprò mai
Se sei una tipa coi suoi spazi (guardi il viso t'imbarazzi)
Bevi latte a colazione (entri dentro le persone)
Nei miei sogni ci sei tu
O anima gemella
Quanto male mi farei (ad inseguire una stella)
E se davvero tu fossi la donna ideale
Ti prego
Mostrati
Diventa

Mi chiedo che cos'è l'amore
È come un fiore nel cemento

Ti aspetto da qui e non cambierò idea

Esisti solo tu come fuoco sulla pelle
Siamo l'anima che brucia
In un mondo che si perde

Nel buio della notte sognando ad occhi aperti
Mi stringi tra le mani
Esisti solo tu

Parole scritte sopra un vetro
E poi gridarle fino al cielo
Sei tu che aspetterò negli occhi
È tutto così vero
Non posso chiedere di più
Non posso più buttare il tempo

Come un fuoco sei tu bruci lento quaggiù

Scappa e non fermarti senti I cuore in gola
Ha rapito anche a me
Ci sta uccidendo
E sai che il sole muore all'orizzonte
Buca il mare come fai con me
Irresistibile

Gocce di rugiada su di me come lacrime
Poter scendere
Scegli la verità, amore, scegli scegli scegli scegli
Se credi ancora nelle favole
Ti prego scappa sulle nuvole

Ha rapito anche me
Ci sta uccidendo
E sai che il sole muore all'orizzonte

Scusa se non ho l’attitudine 
A far finta che non sia successo niente 
Sai che cosa c’è io nel tuo disordine 
Mi perdo 

E poi che serve stare in gioco 
Se tanto il gioco è truccato 
Cerco una storia che non è la mia 
Quì nelle strade del mio tempo 
Ma è solo l’inganno della nostalgia 
Io estraneo del mio tempo 
E scusa se non piango 
Non verso lacrime 
Per un amore che è un abbaglio 
In questa stanza 

C’è troppa polvere 
In mezzo a noi frammenti di routine 
E vita 
Frammenti sparsi come idee 
Si infrangono su me 
Mettendo a nudo la mia parte più debole 
Sai che cosa c’è io del tuo disordine 
Sono stanco 
A cosa serve stare in gioco se tanto 
Ad ogni mossa sbaglio 
Cerco una storia che non è la mia 
Quì nelle strade del mio tempo 
Ma è solo l'inganno della nostalgia 
Io estraneo del mio tempo 
E scusa se non piango 
Non verso lacrime 

Per un amore che è un abbaglio 
Improvviso perché 
Non sò fingere 
Per questo cado, cado 
Lo sai meglio di me 
Che intanto corri 
Lontano, lontano, lontano

Ma è solo l’inganno della nostalgia

E scusa se non piango 
Non verso lacrime

Dear Jack ,"Ti lascerei così
Se mai ti lasciassi
Guardandoti negli occhi
Ma senza abbracciarti
Eviterei l’elenco degli errori
E dei danni

Per non mortificare i traguardi
E ripercorrerei
Tutti gli attimi vissuti
Come quadri alla parete
I miei ricordi impressi
Difenderei il mio cuore e il tuo
Dagli insulti
Che presi dalla rabbia
Potremmo dedicarci

Ti ho amato e son sicuro che
Non smetterò di farlo
Sarà solo diverso
Ma è diverso anche il silenzio
Che prima accompagnava
Il nostro tempo, mentre adesso
Lo sta uccidendo

Ti lascerei così
Se mai ti lasciassi
Senza quei gesti
Un tempo naturali
E adesso imposti

E non inventerei un ruolo
Che non mi appartiene
Sarà il futuro a dirmi
Se sarò minuti o ore

Ti ho amato e son sicuro che
Non smetterò di farlo
Sarà solo diverso
Ma è diverso anche il silenzio
Che prima accompagnava
Il nostro tempo
Mentre adesso
Lo sta uccidendo

Mi hai amato e son sicuro che
Non smetterai di farlo
Sarà solo diverso
Ma è diverso anche il silenzio
Che prima assecondava il nostro amore
Mentre adesso
Lo sta consumando

Ti lascerei così
Se mai dovessi farlo
E lo farei soltanto
Se poi mi rendessi conto
Che tradirei la tua fiducia
Nel dirti che
Il nostro amore è sempre uguale
E invece non lo è
Che è sempre uguale
Ma non per me

Ti ho amato e son sicuro che
Non smetterò di farlo

Ti ho amato e son sicuro che
Non smetterò di farlo
Sarà solo diverso
Ma è diverso anche il silenzio
Che prima accompagnava
Il nostro tempo, mentre adesso
Lo sta uccidendo

Mi hai amato e sono sicuro che
Non smetterai di farlo

Dear Jack ,"E non mi puoi giudicare in mancanza di prove
Sotto una pioggi di massi pesanti come parole
On ti posso giudicare se non c’è ragione

Sui vestiti di lana una domenica al lago
Ed iniettare la certezza che sia tutto virus

Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'll see another highway

I had a lover
I don't think I'll risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing so long

Then I'll stop my dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on corner stores
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
'Cause I have not forgotten them

Looking to start up a fight
They don't play fair jocks outnumbered and scared

",Thrashers,1987
Death Angel,"In the night
In the circle of death
They congregate to hold a feast
There lies a body in the center of the ring
Each human soon becomes a beast

They sing the song to glorify the dead
They chant, the chant eternal life
The master sails as he lifts the gleaming blade
The sound of flesh sliced by the knife

Men without anguish
Men without fear
Men chosen to ride the earth
Evil confrontation nears

These mindless sinners
Sit there without
Greed, not even grief
The final incision
Having now been complete
As these ominous demons
Start to eat

A strident hum
Lurks through the room
The bloody bath to set them free
As they fulfill their long awaited dream
A bloody orgy of intense ecstasy",Voracious Souls,1987
Death Angel,"Trapped by iron bars
Solitary ripping at me inside
A victim of this crazy ward
Must get out of here
No one gets out of here

Force fed medication
The more I take the sooner I'm free
Contributing to my mind's abduction
Can't they see it's tearing me
Can't they see it's killing me

[Chorus]
Welcome to the 3rd floor
It's a one way trip
Then they lock the door

More than just a crazy nightmare
Doors opened up and swallowed me
Banished from existence
Why'd they ever throw away the key
Will I ever be set free

[Chorus]",3rd Floor,1988
Death Angel,"Guilty of no crime
Not enough yet too much time
I'm burning in this hell
Plans to buy and dreams to sell

Sitting by myself
Living life and loving life
But something bothers me
What to do I can't believe

I'm bored
Life it's not so fair
Nothing here and nothing there
I'm waiting constantly
It's not the way life's meant to be

Boredom starts to set
I try so hard but it's all I get
Keep waiting all the time
I think I've reached
The end of the line

Death Angel,"My heater's broke and I'm so tired
I need some fuel to build a fire
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together

It's time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
The cheapest stuff is all I need
To get me back on my feet again

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
It's cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win

You know it's the only thing

Death Angel,"Sometimes in the back of my mind
I feel like something struck me blind
Blind to the path
Leading out of the forest
Losing my grip
I slip into the darkness
Searching for a trace of serenity
I find myself dwelling
In my own self pity
Either going up or coming down
Can I be the king
Or must I be the clown

[Chorus]
Let me tell you something about myself
I got problems only I can tell
Please listen to me I don't want to be
Confused anymore

I'll start today just feeling fine
In reality my sanity is on the line
Why can't life flow nice and easy
It's hard when happiness
Is there tease me

Try to find fun for a brief escape
Someone save me before it's too late
Tell me not to listen
To the voices in my head
Balancing factors I could use instead

Who controls the matter
Of circumstance
Make my move and leave the
Rest up tho chance
Take my hand I'll lead you to a faraway
Place my friend and there

Death Angel,"No choice
I had to do it
Or else it was my ass on the floor
I had to even up the score
So I shot down the bloody

Now I have to face my destiny
No hope for me in a biased society

[Chorus]
Sinner, I'm innocent
Repent, so sorry
Die, no please

Guilty of innocence
My only crime was being at the scene
All fingers point at me
Things aren't as they seem

[Chorus]

Here I sit and wonder why
You constantly must classify
The way I think
The way I look
But I don't really give a
Cause you don't mean a thing to me
And this is what I fail to see

Now I have to go to jail
Cause I can't afford the bail

Death Angel,"Leader of a hippie cult
The devilish chief
Directs his wicked family
To kill psychotically
Dying in agony
As he observes patiently
A quitless bloody murder
In vain enigmatically

[Chorus]
They truly believe
That he is Jesus Christ
As their bodies are raped
Of their minds

Your minds are filled with his lies
And soon reality's deprived
From your life
No sense makes sense
In this world
He has your brainwashed mind
Under control

In the caverns
You are led
Where memory and thoughts
Are dead
Your savior is all you need
And off his love you feed
Dejected utterly
X'd from society
Killed for a so called god
Pledge allegiance to your family

Death Angel,"I just can't believe what I'm seeing
It makes me sick inside
Condemned by the world around me
I'm not gonna run and hide
I'm gonna come alive
Ain't gonna take no jive
Open up your sewn shut eyes
Your disappearing eyes

When I'm walking down the street
People turn and stare at me
As if I couldn't feel their eyes
They're living in a world of fear and lies

Best loosen up and take it in stride
The world don't need egotistical pride

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
And see the light
Just do it

Must you choose to shut your mind
I look deep but nothing do I find
You're so tough hey put it on a shelf
You've got to come out of yourself

Knock knock knock but no one's home
Excuse me please but I'm sick of society

And if we don't agree
Just let it be

Open up your eyes
And see the light
Just do it",Open Up,1988
Death Angel,"The crack of dawn fills the empty sky
We turn our heads towards the east
Between the hills
Walk the paths of love
Towards the caverns of the beast

A distant cry breaks the solitude
Of weary men who journey on
To see the sight horrifies us all
The magic wind blows and it's gone

[Chorus]
Searching for answers
Another clue on the list
Searching for answers
To questions that cease to exist

Decipher the runes of earth
We travel forth to the lake of death
The guardian says that we must pay
The price is high for he demands a life
So it's he we must slay

Beyond the gates
Forests of the darkness
Without the key you'll not get in
We weave the spell
Of time and dimension
Which plants us on
The shores of sin

Death Angel,"I will never understand the way you are
Your mind's an evil tod striving for more
Can't you see I can penetrate your lies

I created you but yet you still defy
It doesn't matter how hard I try
A lesson in respect is what you need

You thrive off the weak minded ones
These pour helpless souls that you deceive
Still come back to the security
Under my sleeve

[Chorus]
Don't beat around the bush
I know it's a task
I only have one question
Which I must ask

When I was sad and down
You suddenly came around
Like a guiding light
No need for me to fight
I told you everything
Brought me up again

Oh how that all changed
Only you to blame
Manipulative days are through
So bye bye to you

You've opposed me since the birth
Wanting your own little world
Brainwashing them to believe

You're the ruler evil supreme
Mother earth is not your toy
Your evil world I will destroy
You were deprived of your youth
You were deprived of joy
Lonely depressed little boy

[Chorus]",Why You Do This,1988
Death Angel,"Blurs of beauty have passed me by
Scenes have flashed inside my mind
Remembered places in memory alive
Forever moving onward

An endless space within you are
Black hopeless hole, feelings are sparse
Seems your goal is gone, devotion wanders far
Take a look back on your past

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel

An aimless search through latent realms
The warmth is lost, cold beings dead
Affection fatal, love bonded to a bed
Release your inner self

Time is sacred until it ends
Never to stop, so cleanse your head
Relax in peace; I'll be happily content
Waiting to fulfill your fate

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear that you still feel

And make the change",Discontinued,1990
Death Angel,"Well, I can't get it off my mind
Said, I just can't seem to leave it behind
And it haunts me till this very day
And I don't think it's ever gonna go away
'Cause the people, yes, the common people
They be knowing this shit is real
Having a good time
Ain't committing no crime
Innocent victims
Pushed to the red line

We'll put you people into a line
Interrogate your mind, rape you one at a time
Don't say a word, shut up, and obey
Your opinion doesn't matter to us anyway
'Cause the more that you resist
Is the quicker you make the list
Making your own choice

Pushing us too far
Gonna make a lot of noise

Death Angel,"Black covers the mass
The mist - it's so dense
It's soothing to breathe
I reach out my hand
Into the sights
Yet I grasp nothing

All seems different to me
What I've seen before

Yearn for the feel
The warmth that's inside
A childish grin
I joyfully scream
To deafened ears
It's time to begin

All seems different to me
What I've seen before
Can't help but notice
Hidden feelings I had stored

As if I am strange

Can't seem to cope; I've gone beyond

Can find a strength in a brief retreat

There's no hope; I'm going down
Won't be long until I kiss the ground

I'm falling out
There's no lasting

Rock a bye baby
In your deep thoughts
When the night wind blows
It's time to rock
A life with no breaks
The child will fall
Down will come baby
No one cares at all

I'm not sure just what to do
Not up to me, not up to you
Always been a different breed
Something like unplanted seed

Just drift into eternal sleep",Falling Asleep,1990
Death Angel,"Within the depths of darkness
Amidst the delusive fog
There waits a path to nowhere
Forthright be stepped upon

Shadows overwhelm her soul
Exceeding anxiety
Their shadows overtake her thoughts

Foretell what lies in store
Running from the grave believers
Try to evade the chase

And, now, it is too late

For him

A room with a view
You're looking at him
He's looking through you
A room with a view
Who's fooling who?
There's got to be something that he knew

So there he sits, and some may wonder
About the sly grin on his face
Yet little do they know

The boundaries of his wisdom
In the solitude of his kingdom

On our way to nowhere

Changing with the shifting wind

It's a real vague story
Impossible to perceive
A seemingly endless time

Passing through eternity
Still devoid of meaning
Useless to inquire upon

Of a twisted mind
All virtues had faded away
Apprehension made her cold
But warm she was inside
The child within her died
And left her with a heart of stone

Surface anger was a thin disguise
Yet at night she cries
Behold the pain in her eyes
Degradation was a grind
Her true self left behind
Compassion you will find
Hidden by a veil of deception

And so the story goes
That's the way she chose to live her life
And anybody knows
The way it feels when you hurt inside
She's running from herself
The game of life in which she played

Looking back upon the early years
There was room for tears
But she chose to push them away
Condemnation was a vice
She chose to roll the dice
And so she paid the price
Misery was her only friend

Inner feelings were a neutral zone
Though she tried to condone
In a world she faced so alone
Her salvation came too late
And on that day she died
No one even cried
Forgot about the veil of deception

In the eye of the storm

History's been reborn

And you choose your wine
Like you chose your friends
And you base your life
On each passing trend

And I say
No to false claims
No to their aims
No to all of their rules

We've been sent back

I just couldnt believe it

and every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters

And kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all

Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both

Death Cab for Cutie,"Alone on a train aimless in wander
An outdated map crumpled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going
'Cause they're all different names for the same place

The boundaries of language I quietly cursed
And all the different names for the same thing",Different Names for the Same Thing [DVD],2006
Death Cab for Cutie,"Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind and I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
Son, fear is the heart of love,so I never went back

You and me we've seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms",I Will Follow You into the Dark [DVD],2006
Death Cab for Cutie,"If I could open my arms and span the length of the isle of Manhattan
I'd bring it to where you are, making a lake of the East River and Hudson
If I could open my mouth wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing and bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings

I wish we could open our eyes to see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view, if you were never aware of what was around you
And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half-empty or half-full
It slowly rises
Your love is gonna drown",Marching Bands of Manhattan [DVD],2006

'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
Just as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

You'll be loved you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
And someday you will be loved

The longest shadows ever cast

And we frolicked about in our summer skin

I don't recall a single care
Just greenery and humid air
Then Labor Day came and went 
And we shed what was left of our summer skin

On the night you left I came over
And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
Our brand new coats were so flushed and pink
And I knew your heart I couldn't win
Because the season's change was a conduit
And we'd left our love in our summer skin",Summer Skin [DVD],2006
Death Cab for Cutie,"And it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to Father Time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU that reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself that I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD took you a little farther away from me

Amongst the vending machines and year-old magazines in a place where we only say good-bye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds
But I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground as the T.V. entertained itself

Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone will lift their heads
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said
That love is watching someone die

So who's gonna watch you die?",What Sarah Said [DVD],2006

How it ages when you're away
And spring blooms and you find a love that's true
But you don't know what now to do
'Cause the chase is all you know and she stopped running months ago

And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone

The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need

And there on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone",Your Heart Is an Empty Room [DVD],2006

No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise 
The youthful boy below who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for both a beginning and an end 
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on accident 

On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still resigned. 
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn for the sea like navy men

and the nights when the living room was on the lawn. 
Constant quarreling the childish fits
and our clothes in a pile on the ottoman. 
All the slander and double speak were only foolish attempts
to show you did not mean,
anything but the blatant proof was your lips touching mine in the photobooth. 

And as the summers ending the cold air rush your hard heart away. 
You were so condescending, 
and this is all that's left 
scraping paper to document. 
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on. 

Cup your mouth to compress the sound, 
skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town. 
And everything that I said was true
as the flashes blinded us in the photobooth. 
Well I lost track when those words were said, 
you took the wheel and you steered us into my bed, 
and soon we woke and I walked you home
and it was pretty clear that is was hardly love. 

And as the summers ending, 
the cold air will rush your hard heart away. 
You were so condescending,

But she can't relax with his hands on the small of her back
And as the flash bulbs burst
She holds a smile like someone would hold a crying child

And soon everybody will ask what became of you

Cath, it seems that you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed
You said your vows, and you closed the door
On so many men who would have loved you more

And soon everybody will ask what became of you
And your heart was dying fast, and you didn't know what to do

And whispers the things that make me so bitter, it's sick

From the pictures he paints of the passion in heat
And though I try, I can't stop listening

And I've tried bribery but to no effect
'Cause there's no amount of money that would get him to split
As long as I'm living and we're not together
I'll be chained to this beast with no chance of severance

The hidden cameras on the casino floor
And what gets paid for behind hotel doors
Oh, come on

You pretend every slot machine is a robot amputee waving hello
The people stare into their eyes and they feed them little bribes and then they go

The never-ending twilight
In a basement where the sun has never split
You said that you were lonely
And then we kissed like lonely people do

You said the city has a beating heart
That pushes people down the boulevard
And they're all hoping for a wish fulfilled
In a desert for a dollar bill
Those foolish dreams, you know they plague me still
Oh, come on

And oh so empty were the faces
Of the dealers and the waitresses around [X2]

They're empty",Little Bribes [Version],2009
Death Cab for Cutie,"With every sun that sets I am feeling more
Like a stranger on a foreign shore
With an eroding beach disappearing from underneath

And when my mirror speaks it never minces words
Because these eyes don't shine half as bright
As they used to do and they haven't for quite a while

Because I'm a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside my head
With nothing on either end

I always fall in love with an open door
With a horizon on an endless sea
As I look around the ones who were standing right in front of me

And then my mirror speaks with irreverence
Like a soldier I can't command
It sees a child in the body of a full-grown man

And he's a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines

And there's a tangled thread inside his head
With nothing on either end
There's nothing on either end

A new position for a different view
And nothing changes but the slightest hues
And I am standing face to face

With a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside his head
With nothing on either end

I'm a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside my head
With nothing on either end

There's nothing on the ends
No there's nothing on the ends",My Mirror Speaks [Version],2009
Death Cab for Cutie,"Oh my talking bird
Though you know so few words
You're on infinite repeat
And you're brain can't keep up with your beak

And you're kept in an open cage
So you're free to leave or stay
And sometimes this makes you confused
But there's no hint that I'm trying to give you

The longer you think the less you know what to do

It's hard to see your way out
When you live in a house in a house
Cause you don't realize
That the windows were open the whole time
But oh, my talking bird
Though your feathers are tattered and curved
I'll love you all your days
Til the breath leaves your fragile frame

It's all here for you as long as you choose to stay

Hey

It's all here for you as long as you don't fly away",Talking Bird [Demo Version][Version],2009
Death Cab for Cutie,"Meet me on the Equinox
Meet me half way
When the sun is perched at it's highest peek
In the middle of the day

Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh darling understand

That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends

Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst

Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand

That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends

A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you

As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends

Meet me on the Equinox
Meet me half way
When the sun is perched at it's highest peek
In the middle of the day

Death Cab for Cutie,"We won't get far
Flying in circles inside a jar
'Cause the air we breathe
Is thinning with the words that we speak

That we speak
You and me
That we speak

You're on the floor
Fearful of what's outside your door
But the codes and keys
They can protect you
From the pangs of jealousy

Death Cab for Cutie,"She may be young but she only likes old things
And modern music it ain't to her taste
She loves the natural light
Captured in black and white

She sees mirages of mountain ranges
Within a blink of her eyes it changes
Back to the open plain
Oh no she can't explain

I cry out love, keep your arms around me
I am a bird that's in need of grounding
I'm built to fly away,
I never learned how to stay

And when you're looking in the mirror what you see is gonna astound you
But all these lines and greys refine, they are the maps of our design
Of what began on Monday morning

Death Cab for Cutie,"Portable television, shrouded in snow
In a raggedy van on the side of the road
The night it had frozen through my little bones
So you took me in your arms, you squeezed out the cold

And oh

Upstate New York, autumn, brightly colored leaves
Oh, the hills were on fire, they burn for you and me
And where we were going it was built like a lie
But as sacred as the Bible, so we didn't question why

And oh

I saw it in the soil just recently
Where the rows of teeth they grow in fields of infinite greed
And here laid the father, and here stood the son
Where the road meets the horizon for everyone
For everyone

Portable television, take us away
From this burden of reflection we've carried today
Oh, the generator's running but there's nothing on the air
And the static is a comfort, so we huddle around and stare

Death Cab for Cutie,"St. Peter's Cathedral
Built of granite
Ever fearful of the answer
When the candle in the tunnel
Is flickering and sputters
And fading faster
It's only then that you will know
What lies above or down below
Or if these fictions only prove
How much you've really got to lose

At St. Peter's Cathedral
There is stained glass
There's a steeple that is reaching
Up towards the heavens
Such ambition never failing to amaze me
It's either quite a master plan
Or just chemicals that help us understand
That when our hearts stop ticking
This is the end

In the belly of the beast
In the belly of the beast,
And with her song in your heart
It can never bring you down

Lost in a maze
Of a thousand rainy days

But when I heard her voice
Oh it led me to the end

Yes it led me to the end

'Cause when she sings I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echoes through me

When we move as one
We stay young

Underneath the overpass
Mangled in the shards of a mental frame
Woken from a dream by my own name

Searching everywhere for a homeland

Sifting through the rubble for the wrong things

I cannot be stopped soon as I start
But you have seen your darkest rooms
And I have slept in makeshift tombs
This is where we find our peace
This is where we are released

The world was so much smaller than

And we all laughed at his expense

Out in this vast Binary Sea

Make sure this moment never dies

And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone
