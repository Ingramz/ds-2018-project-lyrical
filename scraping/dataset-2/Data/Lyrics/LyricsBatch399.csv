Streets critical
Bumpin' this bud like Mistercap
Bought me two bricks call me 60 thou
Pay for the coke nigga and a smile
Paid for the case nigga beat the trial
Bought a Rolex nigga and a dial
Gang of bad bitches yeah and they foul
Gang of young niggas yeah and they wild

Cookin' them chickens like Mr. Chow
Yeah I know the streets like critical

I'm still rapping
I'm still trapping
Know 'em all my life
But I still clap 'em
Yeah I know I don't own a team
But so what bitch I'm still a captain
Guns up, my money stacked
My work guaranteed, money back
I sold dope and I slung crack
Twelve twelve, them hundred sacks
I'm done with that
I had fun with that
Y'all go ahead, y'all run with that
Only thing about the game of life is
When you lose you can't run it back
Block-boomin, spot-boomin
Start asking, stop assuming
Better than me there's not a human
Take the plates off, cop a new one
Two door cost me a quarter mil'
Make sure you knock off all the pills
Spent a little extra, caught the deal
44 Bulldog off your grill
First they get your name, then they get your files
Then they sit you down
Street life is critical

My mind gone, my mind blown
All the shit that my mind on
Streets are waitin' for, niggas hatin', I'm still gettin' my shine on
My cup full, my pocket full, my tank never on ""E"" bitch
All them 2's I be talkin' 'bout, damn right they on me bitch
Summer time, four 9's, cook 'em shits like dinner hoe
Every day is my birthday, it's like every month September hoe
Got this Rollie on, lookin' holy homes

Jadakiss,"I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage
These hoes steady buggin'
My phone steady buzzin'
I think it’s the plug finna drop off a dozen
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing

Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing

Right off the back all these niggas be fronting
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Get that gut feeling you know that they coming
You ain't got no paper ain't even worth running
Hoped out the cutlass and hopped in the bucket
Run in your mouth you’ll get popped in your nugget
You had the ball then you dropped it then fuck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don’t let yourself be the next kiss opponent
No I ain't driving but yeah bitch I own it
Usually niggas get caught in the moment
I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones half ones even zips moving
We ain't even gonna talk about the bricks moving
Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin
Hard times come you just gotta get through 'em
These lil niggas got a lotta shit brewing
Feds get involved then alotta shit ruined
Used to spit at niggas now I spit through 'em
I don’t wash clothes nigga I just get new ones
Real boss niggas it be hard to get to 'em
Yeah real low on the suckers
I walked out the trap house and hopped in the Cutlass

I hopped in the Cutlass

Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing
Now I got money they can’t tell me nothing

Where I’m from ain't nothing but survival
Before niggas pray the gonna pick up that rifle
Before niggas sleep they gonna camp out and snipe you
Wipe you off the face of the earth your face on a shirt
Ive been through in that phantom fly back to the place that I'm from
But not happy with that they took my brother the government kidnap and shit
I ain't just talking I ain't just rapping said it really happened
That’s why I get on shit that you with and I vomit
I don’t give a fuck you know how Exo coming
It's beef I'm at you and I might be atacha woman
I make it look like you put time in for nothing
Don't make no sudden movements around me I’m clutching
These niggas haven't seen the money I’m touching
I even put their hands on cars that I'm pushing
But I ain't jumping for a nigga

I hopped in the Cutlass
I hopped out a bucket
I pop like I pulled out my weight in some luggage

Jadakiss,"Right now I just wanna say thank you, (thank you)
For your downloads, ya streams, ya hard copies

Even if you bootlegged this joint I appreciate you

Thanks for all the support for riding out wit ya nigga
Despite what you may think or what you may have heard

Top 5 dead or alive

Everything is real ain't nothing cozy
Fresher than a young nigga mind of a OG
Inhale exhale yea cherish every breath
Shinin’ like I just came home but I never left
Most of them is lovin’ me some of them hatin’ me
Say hes underrated dependin’ on whose ratin’ me
I be destroyin' niggas on tracks blatantly
Basically I'm patiently waitin’ for a vacancy
It ain't hard to tell they all scared to challenge ’em
Money power respect I learned how to balance them
Water melon over the pump the hood silencer
Couple hundred thousand a month is a good calendar
Yea they love to hear the don speak
That's because my dialog ain't in arms reach
Nah I ain't wit the coward ish
First the skinny jeans now they wearin’ blouses
Don't ever confuse wireless for powerless
A nice red wine haze and a sour mix
I'm in the trap wit the blicky
Cigarettes pills and the sticky
If you need somethin hit me
When it's poppin I breeze quickly
To ya door step if ya coppin at least 50
Never mix my feelings wit my dealings
I'm house shoppin’ for wood floors high ceilings
200 or more on the dash if I'm wheelin’
Really these just niggas is mad 'cause I'm chillin’
Face on the masters mother pearls
I maintain 'cause I dominated the underworld
If you sick to ya stomach that mean you wanna earl
The moon and the stars tell you that son is thorough
I'm gettin’ better every week
And I don't talk too much the longevity will speak
They ain't selling you nothing
You think its better 'cause its cheap
With the push of a button I'll get you wet up in the street
Its never been even I'm one of the best breathin’
Ya red shirts might be ready by next season
The spread's too high is nothing I just tease 'em
More celebratin’ this year and less grieving
But I'm always down for a funeral
For a nigga hatin' while I'm tryna do my numerals
Screw faces side glances
6 shooter headshots 5 chances
25 large or 5 dances
As you can see I'm fascinated wit the finances
Nah he don't play
And he'll forever be top 5 DOA nigga!

Jadakiss,"You got me feeling like I ain't winning
I'm starting from the beginning
Like go Forest, go Forest
I make so much fucking money, yeah they go for it
These rims ain't for sale, bitch
This whip ain't for sale, bitch
And this Cuban ain't for sale, bitch
I been on the fucking boat like a sail bitch
500 feet on the fucking water
Ten fucking karats for my baby daughter
You come through boy, place your order
I got some niggas that'll meet you at the fucking border

I got my hoodie and my mask on
I got my gun and my blast on

Officer don't shoot, can't breathe)

I'm just one of the five, I'm just one with the vibes
Either niggas is jealous or they just want you to die
They don't want you to rise, they just want your demise
So I be crossing my T's and I be dotting my I's
You on the opposite side, shotgun will fly
Best part about it, I can stay right up in Yonkers and hide
Keep a gun in the door, that's all in the rides
Until my niggas come home, free all of the guys
This shit is all a facade, thought it was all a surprise
I heard all of the stories, seen all of the lies
Long as the work is official, and the corner supplied
At the end of the day niggas, we gonna survive

Can't figure it out or they don't wanna decide
I'm in the gutter reclines, might flood it with dimes
Since you asked, I'mma hit you with the butt of the nine
Bullets soaking in pine, let 'em open your spine
Use your brain a little, my nigga open your mind
If you ain't in the circle, for a square I get you lined
I know niggas is telling, I don't care about the time
Yeah I got weed on me, I don't care about the fine
From a hood where niggas don't give a fuck by design
Yeah, it's real life, it's not a rhyme
And remember, if you don't get caught it's not a crime

I'm on a paper chase they want me outta my zone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone
Yeah, high as fuck driving alone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone
Sometimes I can't feel the hate when its nearest
I can see it clearer than the man in the mirror
Feeling down and I'm telling myself cheer up
I'm only scared of God and the man in the mirror

Ya destiny’s in yo hand inner strength a Conan
Too much time spent in the hood will have u programmed
Or in ya cell writing a kite listening to slow jams
The 2-3 ain't workin' on me they gotta go man
I got the ball movin’ I rock a small Cuban
I'm too famous to deny some of my wrong doing
Its never about what you’ve done what you can do for them
Family and friends I be done rapidly losing them
Look at they name think about it before deleting it
Before you sit down at the table watch who you eating wit
Hopefully those ain't the people that you competing wit
I'm too focused to quit my journey before completing it, what's up

I'm on a paper chase they want me outta my zone

I'm only scared of God and the man in the mirror

It’s a difference between what you doin' and what you tryna do
Price u pay for not being humble is astronomical
Especially when you in the jungle what would the lions do
If you can do the math on that then do the science too
Move around wit the 4 pound or a 9 or two
Hometown hate I receive ain't worth responding to
I'm the one that made them believe in a Yonkers dude
Even though they hated on me I'm responsible
First they gonna try divide then they conquer you
Try to make u swallow your pride 'cause they sponsored you
Yeah, I only fear two beings, one I can talk to
The other I can see him

Jadakiss,"Y'know, yeah, you gotta roll with the punches (uh-huh)
Take some bumps, give some bruises (exactly)
Its easy to just give it all up, or just quit and say fuck it
Its hard to keep going, yeah yo

When it all seems hopeless, real hard to focus
Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
Taking things personal, easily insulted
Doing dumb shit, and don't care what the results is
Ain't scared to die, but you thinking 'bout a coffin
And quitting ain't an option but you think about it often
Saying to yourself, how this ain't fair
You got the strength but the energy, just ain't there
That same vision that you used to have just ain't clear
The storm gets heavier, the sun disappears
You just hoping that there's light, at the end of the tunnel
Either that or oil money at the end of the funnel
Hit a different mind-frame once you been through the jungle
But you can stumble on a hit, and get rich on a humble
Least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go, ah-haa)
We got one more mile to go

First the depression kicks in, then you get animal-like
Hate can turn to motivation if you channel it right
Its like you at a seminar, on the panel of life
If you don't reach the destination they don't hand you your stripes
And the work is just keeping my name alive more
All I'm tryna do is finish the game with a high score
I done laughed and cried and then laughed and cried more
And I know what I want, so don't ask cause I'm sure
From a cloth that no longer exists, self cut
Every time you look back you just throwin' yourself up
At least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go

And even if I lost everything, I'll keep going
And even if they try to break me down
I'll keep hoping for better times, hey
Lemme hear you say, ho
Lemme hear you say, hey
Lemme hear you say, yeah

When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (yeah)
We got one more mile to go (we ain't gon' never stop)

Smoke a lil’ weed you might pop a couple pills
Sharp as a Ginsu everybody's against you
Things that you get yourself into is all mental

Never speak to cops only speak to attorneys
Had to leave the block took the whole hood on my journey
Hear these niggas talkin', who they talkin' to
I ascended from heaven I can walk on the moon
Everybody a killa guess everybody a goon
Not every don is a don till a don walk in the room

So you already know what not to do
That Moroccan hashish is like rocket fuel
Yea sometimes it better not to see the ground
Yea sometimes it better not to be around
Always keep a couple dollars and a P around
I might experience turbulence when I see the town
The worlds under me
I’m where the lightning and the thunder be
'Cause down there ain't no fun to me
With that said I ain't going back
I’m bout to blow a sack and I all know is that

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high

Rollin up, money can't folded up
How you gonna say you cold as us
Can’t smoke enough
Diamonds in my chain nah homie it ain't 14 karats
Lil nigga that ain't gold enough
Staying on top while these haters praying I stop and
You niggas waiting on cars while I pull em strain out the lot
You could catch me rolling up reefer, I stay on that pot
And I’m always repping for my gang I know I say that a lot
'Cause I can remember the days before I got paid
Me and my niggas was trying to make our way
We getting on fuck what y'all say
Made some millions and got niggas with me tryna do the same thing
So I made moves bossed up in the game
Ball hard don’t get crossed up in the game
Seen alotta dudes get loss up in the game
That’s why every time you see me

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high

High as the towers before they knocked them down
Teflon like Gotti before they locked him down
Word to the mollies niggas in poppin now
But I’m just chillin just passing the pot around

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay

We don’t ride how you niggas ride
Politics to the side no one sicker than I

What's the meaning of living

If you came from the dirt
Now you touching the sky
You keep fucking wit me
You must be rushing to die
So you better decide
'Cause it's better to ride
I'm 2 slots after the 3rd dead or alive
You can give me the racks instead of the shine
'Cause I been doin' what I'm doin' ahead of my time
If you ain't hearin' what I'm doin' you better rewind
The only thing I'm scared of doin' is federal time

And I done counted up a million several times
Gold plated desert eagles incredible nines
Better flows better fabrics better designs

I put some money on ya head
Or some bread on ya mind
We ya problem alone
But we better combined
Do it for those not here
And forever confined
And we ain't promised tomorrow

And we ain't givin it away
So lets measure the lines
And keep killin these niggas

Can we talk about it, not just artists, but the players too

I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all,

Jaded Thorns,"I am drifting here, alone and incomplete.
Searching for the other part of me, for my missing peace.
All the ways I""ve known, the paths I used to seek,
Every one of them seems empty now.
No more within my reach.
Now there's something, I feel something.
Yes there's something stirring
Just beneath the surface,
Of all I thought I knew lies the naked truth,
Of who I am and what I'm coming to.

As I grope within this suffocating silence,
I feel you calling me to you now.
I hear your voice and then; I feel there's something,
Now there's something, yes there's something stirring...
When I look into your eyes, I see myself within.
Can I reach beyond this empty life?
When I look into your eyes, the darkness seems to fade.

Syre died in the sunset, don't be like him

Until he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this

See, Syre grew a tear in his eye
Because the summer's too bright for his spirit in the night

Come here mama I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

When I open my eyes, I wish to see you
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew
Isn't the first time, but the worst time and I'm feeling so blue
You sit in your room and you listen to tunes
And I'm feeling embarrassed it's true
You out there in Paris with who?
When I open my eyes (eyes), I wish to see you
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew

If you wanna come through, there's a seat just for you
My prettiest secret I hope that you keep it
I'm blue as a piece of the moon and I know I'll be seeing you soon

Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now
The MSFTS all stay on the up and up and I'm tryna hold it down
They stay attackin' us I'ma just weep on my willow
I look what they sayin', they playin' as I go to sleep on my pillow
But then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you

Now we're up to something
Girl you're hella grumpy
I think you're just hungry
'Cause right now you're actin' up
I don't think you want me
You just want my company
While your man is
We know all the girls who laugh at us
Girl you got me running
From you, I want nothing

Syre
Passion, pain and desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the Sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes, Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone

I'm rollin'

Legend says Syre still exists in the midst, in the fall
Poet ssay he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost",Ninety,2017
Jaden Smith,"Syre, a beautiful confusion (I love you)
The story of a boy who chased the sunset until it chased him (where you goin'?)
Never quite sure about his placement or
Where he's been in this pink world or why nothing ever made sense
He knew that he had loved and had been loved
But had no chronological order to place it (so confusing)
All he knew was that he woke up everyday
Bleeding with amnesia and the case of
New memories that he had tendencies to mistake for fiction (she's so beautiful)
So everyday he journeyed to the mountain to recover his past
In order to understand his future (I can't remember all this)
She loves him but she eventually killed him (pow, pow, pow, pow)
Now listen, Syre was a mischief with a vision but
His most poetic trait was his wisdom (where you goin'?)
His mind was as bright and as pink as the city that he lived in
And the only kids that could live in this bliss
Were the outcasts, the misfits (why did you leave?)
Those were his companions
Even though they could never understand his
Struggles through these harsh lands
He gave them the upper hand of his emotional tantrums

Syre, passion, pain and desire
Just like my big bro
What you didn't know is this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets slow he's invincible (time)
So much so, that he redefines inevitable
So it'll never go (brace yourself)
It seems as though the sun wouldn't set at all
Instead of setting slow
She lied to him and said she'd never let him go (you're a liar)
And as the legend goes
Syre lived forever on and never and forever alone (Syre)

No soft tissues, my tears fell and froze

A small gesture goes a long way in this dark prism
Your stare's a silent pistol, the boy was your only victim
Like you're so freakin' far out of my league, I been really trippin'
I forgot how we was livin', my niggas just got evicted
I picked a golden pencil out my pocket and gettin' busy
They told me it's all written
I been on tour, rollin' 
On the bus and I'm sittin', really just reminiscing
Like one day, she'll get the vision
When I build her house with all the glass and the marble kitchen
'Til then, we retrofittin' the Honda Civic
And whippin' the X through the city
Eatin' pasta at the Commons like it's my business
Promise I'm God's witness, and you a goddess
Birthday's coming up
My niggas said don't get you nothing too expensive
You say it's too expected
If it was up to me, I'd put the rose petals down for you girl
At your every entrance

So in reality, I'm in the cut of the club with my jaw clenched
And tinted lenses, even more expected, fuck
She said, ""I love our friendship""
My heart dropped when I saw you sent it
And if you ever got a sign from my eyes, girl just know I meant it
I just wish that night never ended, fuck

'Cause girl, if it's up to me, it's up to me, you're mine
But I just think you and me might really need some time

If your soul can pay the toll

When I leave your side I begin to cry, I'm traumatized
Long strolls behind Abbey Road
We're so cold that the autumn died, it's all in the eyes)
(It's probably how I find the way
That you standing through space and time, a contortion of ions) I've seen this road before

For me there's no portion of lying, absorbed in the nightfall) I don't know

A la orilla de la playa me quiere atrapar
Una chica que ni me conoce
Me está pidiendo a gritos que la roce
Y que la ponga en pose
Y que le de, y que le de
Que la ponga en pose
Y que le de, y que le de

Y así que toma, toma
Toma lo que te toca
Toma, toma
Toma lo que te toca

Aprovecha que este es el momento
Siente el calor

Jadikiss,"My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a number two pencil
Stabbin students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in ""Dead Presidents"", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin' that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood ""los sangres"", blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison

My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try ""Now you know you done fucked up right?""
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all

[Chorus]
J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
""Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed!""

Aye yo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around
And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that fagots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'

My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up

[Chorus]

It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed

But your touch is miles away
Deep within this strange asylum
Voices will stay

I need to restrain

Years spent in purity and grace
Have you ever wondered how beautiful it
Is in life's embrace?

What if I failed what I passed before

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found

And how precious did that Grace appear

Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise

Jads & Jadson,"É hoje que a terra treme é hoje que a pedra rola
Este é o som da minha terra cheguei no som da viola!

Não sei de vim pra ensinar ou se vim pra aprender
Eu sou pimenta nos olhos daquele que não quer ver
Quem bateu tem que apanhar, quem matou tem que morrer
Covarde morre gritando, o valente sem gemer!

Sem sangue não tem chouriço, sem luta não tem vitória
É preciso muita garra pra subir os degraus da glória
Como farofa e areia, dou a mão à palmatória
Se um dia ver um covarde que fez bonito na história

Urutu de cruz na testa vê a morte mas não corre
Vai de encontro com fogo, dando bote ela morre
Homem que apanha calado, ele pra mim não nasceu
Homem que tombou na luta é um herói que não morreu",No Som Da Viola,2006

Não posso evitar me sentir assim

Como é que eu faço pra escapar
Dessa vontade que eu tenho de falar
Toda hora com você
Faço planos impossíveis pra te ver
Mas pra mim são tão reais
E o que aconteceu eu nem me lembro mais

Eu poderia escrever mil canções só pra você
Poderia te falar meus motivos pra gostar tanto de você
Me diz quando a gente vai se ver

E tentar te explicar a falta que você me faz

Você me diz que não tá bem
Que não para de pensar em mim também
Agora antes de dormir
Por um segundo, eu consigo até sorrir
Por que essa complicação?
Distância é o fim pra quem tem coração!

Será que eu devo te dizer
Que eu quase choro quando falam de você?
Mas eu consigo segurar
Pra ter certeza que ninguém vai reparar
Que eu tô cada vez pior

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man

You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash

Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why

We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

Bomb up, as I conduct, this is Ang' furry, huh
I made berry, the whole league in Jones Beach
And bake berry, the H jerry's is so sweet
So brief, aim's gone, in the building
O.G.'s ain't honor the brilliant, except for the minds
That push the breathe, for the best to colide
Better yet, I put the X in define
Never fret, when it's beef, I put the pep' in the nine
From your brain to my watch, you be ahead of my time

They claim they from the trap, like T.I. or Jeezy
Claim to be a O.G., like Snoop Dogg or Eazy
Knowing you went to Cali, won't say no names

Refuse to talk about just, cars and bling-bling

The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me

She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater

Shes a nymphomaniac,
Brainiac,
Literally the smartest and the taken fact,
She like girls so every girl is her theme song
She jump up on that dick and get her trampoline on
I'm tryna tell her how sexy she look wit' cream on
And all she wanna know is why I still got my jeans on
Bounce till the springs gone
Ride ya till you cant continue
Head board of the bead banging like a gang member
And when I gotta headache I don't do the normal nursin'
When my skull hurtin' yea she my skull surgeon
She don't care if she get her hair or her neck pulled
She could go all night her heart pumped, red bull

Wild wild west dough, though them girls white
Really give that best dome
Do do head, suck me dead
Leave that coffin wet, rub this lube up on yo chest
Playin' wit' yo tittie pits, fennin' like a kid again
Let the mammal in, hump ya like a camel skin
Into her lions den, tiger dog in this bitch

She fuck like a porn star, be bouncin' like a bad check
Head goin' up and down like hydraulics in her neck

She throw it back with no pain
And I ain't talkin' no domestic violence,
But she'll take your wife beater

I don't know what to tell ya,
Ca ca can't answer the phone I'm a have to email ya (hell yeah)

Flag in my right pockets
Star track fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial I'm all about my decimels
Retarded in the booth they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is a** backwards
Gudda speak crack and you n****s is crack addicts
The simple mathematics.
You cut the check and I rake in the green like I'm raking the gra** in
Pretty b****es damn near feint when they pa**ing
Call my whip Martin but the first name Aston
Tata head n****s get mashed when I'm spazzin'
Think you f***ing with me put your cash in, nah I doubt
I was young and reckless when Pete say he was about it
You n****s is ducks howards, cowards
Kill the competition and shower n****s with flowers
This rap s*** is ours
Pop b****

Uh, uptown back in it
Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis
Black semi,
I've never sat in hemi
That would offend me

Paychecks on paychecks
And I still want payback
And I still don't play that

Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay

Mama ain't make me to make homies
She make me to make history
So doing that's my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and the target is the industry
Two things I love in the World, good head and victory
You ain't doing it big and broke stop kidding me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr T
This is Misery, no Cathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money slap ya straight
Yeah I'm a big joker so you know I slap you ace

Leave the club with ya girl send her home with an ashy face
Love is a gamble but it's my casino
Pretend that your the loser I hope that she (?)
I hope the game got life insurance
Cause I'm kill it
And all you wack a** rap n****s dying with it
I'm so Harlem eating but so starving
Pockets full of fat like all I do is eat margarine

Crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top

His pitch flip cause the n**** flop
My s*** hit like the pitch was soft
N****s cotton balled
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her p**** cross guard but I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like f*** the f***ing law
I bet daddy gone, who wanna make it done

Shttin on em like hittin the barn

Man you don't speak at all

Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It's Y.M.E. nothing gets in between us

Tell Wayne I'm going in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game nobody could ever bury me

I told my team I got us man it's all on me
Like volume 2 BG I got my crew with me

You ask why I reply cause nobody remember 2 or 3
Cross Y.M. and the hem will make a movie

Yeah, Young money army we marching
We coming forward no warning
We got these boys running like Forest
So salute me like a general
First place never last
Always on top and I'm a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in strangle hold no letting up
You can get the top, ya can pop like 7 Up
Knock knock let us up, young money applaud me
And we'll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

I'mma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn't given
Everything that I've given, I swear I'll never give in

Just look at what I've been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me,
'Cause young money is the Navy better yet the Army

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops

One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the World, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don't ask me about shit but money
Fuckin' right my money long I got that 10ft money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I'm in deep like wet pussy
I'm a purple heart proven war vet rookie
You can't even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me
Now don't step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain't we God's children
I know at all times God's feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me

New Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
Twenty hour flight, now we jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close? I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day til the night pass
Damn, I ain't trying to fight that
But if we fall too fast, will the feeling last?

Champagne, good dine and good times, and now it's all over

Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that trip was big, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name,
Man if I get a chance she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm aimin' my move, you know what I mean,
In order to be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
Bitch have got a, heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bathroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
She a TV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at webby yet, so

Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that Aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, ""Man, we got next""
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance

Jae Sinnett,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1997
Jae the Giant,"Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far

I remember many days I was somewhere on my own
Praying ah god let me see your plan
Everything happen for a reason
Even though certain s*** I probably would never understand
Now I pull up in the hood something all black with a foreign name, I'm king of the land
With a motherf***in attitude and a bunch of heaters on me
P**** n****s better have a fan
I'mma be a real n**** till I gong out
Ridin' for the hood till the wheels blown out
Streets mean what the f*** you wanna know about
In the trap still tryna get this load out
Fast money I would never take a slow route
Ten bricks with a chopper on the fold out
I recommend you role with it or get rolled out
I dedicate it to the n****s who done sold out
I guess I was chose
B****es openin my doors
I am the s***, no need to check your nose
Every b**** I want comin out their clothes
A**hole habits hustle like a savage
S*** round my neck b**** nothing 'bout it average
Open up the safe you would think it's full of cabbage

'Cause look how he made me

Caught a case back in '08 n****, I was seventeen facing three years
Cut a few n****s off that were bringing me down
Now I'm on top like three lid
Why you never really see a n**** trip out, pray this s*** gon' really out, blessed to be here
I'm just a n**** from the slum, now I'm rich with a get money gut like a n**** drink beer
Made it out the hole, almost ended off the road
Now I'm on and out the road state to state doing shows
Came a long way from kicking doors, stealing n**** bowls
Or sleeping on the floor
And walkin' to the store
Now I might pull up in a roll when you walkin on more
Whoever knew that the streets did take me this far
Used to rock G shocks now I might rock the rollie or flaunt that Audemar
Bosses be the magic used to make Paris
Now I got Houston just to order seafood salad
Thank god for the times that a n**** did struggle
(Everything happens for a reason)
That what made my hustle now a young n**** vision just stuck on top
(Money over everything)
I was piecing out the puzzle now a n**** diamond wet like a puddle

Jae-P,"Yo this song's going out to all the little homies out
There
That are thinking of getting into trouble
Hope this song makes you think

En medio del pasillo me sentia bien perdido
Pasaba todo el mundo estaba enloquesido
Sacaba mi coraje peleando con mi hermana
Pensaba en matarme
Mi vida es nada
Sin poder entender
Bajo mi ignorianca mi jefita sufrira
Por toda mi infancia
Un dia me sento
Me dijo ""No seas pendejo tu crees que a mi
Me gusta andar limpiando espejos
Tu sabes de la vida""me dijo mi jefita
Deja de fumar why tambien esa bebida
Si no te compones preso iras a terminar
Por tu propia voluntad te iras a destrozar
Why esos amigitos que se dicen ser familia
No mas lo que te enseñan son puras grocerias
Dime cuantas veces te an resado un Rosario
No mas lo que te enseyan es como ser un vago.""

(Coro)
Perdoname Ama no te quise lastimar
Me quisiste avisar no te pude escuchar
Perdoname Ama no te quise lastimar
El amor que tu me diste no lo voy encontrar

Me mandaban al la escuela,me pintiaba con los Homies
En la casa de mi amigo me pasaba tome why tome
Le entrabamos a todo, no teniamos perdon
El jefe de la banda era yo el mas chingon
Pero todo llego al fin la lana se acabo
Quise hacer un jale, asaltar la liquor store
No quise usar mi cuete pero George se acelero
Le metio un cuetazo al Chino why al piso se callo
En medio de la preda no supe que paso
Corri pa' el otro lado why la juda me alcanzo
Me dijo no te muevas o te trueno aqui pelon
Despues de ese dia otra vida empezo
Cuando hiba en la patrulla pense en mi jefita
Hora si la regue se va queder solita
Yo me acuerdo que mi abuelo me dicia
""No seas bruto No ay pandilla ni homeboy
Que te saque de ese pulcro""

(Coro)

Encerrado en la pinta el resto de mi vida
Sufri un gran dolor por fallarle a mi jefita
Ya no se que hacer mi vida esta perdida
Pagare las consecuencias,ya no habra salida
En la calle fui Chingon pero aqui no valgo nada
Soy un simple numero como otros camaradas
Aunque no fue mi culpa yo no quise ir a matar
Si andas en pandillas lo mismo te ira a pasar
Hoy encarselado pensando en que hacer
Si me hubiera yo quedado a estudiar a hacer el bien
Por eso yo les digo sigan buenos pasos
Ay que hacer cumplidos pues sigan estudiando
Destroce el corazon de mi madre
La que me dio su sangre
La que me dio a luz why me quito pues el hambre
Sufrire toda mi vida,aqui conocere la muerte
Solo Dios sabra como aqui corre mi suerte

(Coro)Asta el fin",Perdóname Amá,2003

Partido tengo el corazón estoy herido
Por que me miras tanto
Y no me das mas un simple hola, como estas?

Me estas volviendo loco
Enloquecer ver que tu
No puedes ser mi mujer
Dia y noche pienso solo en ti
No me puedo enfocar baby

Lucho entenderte para poder conciliar mi frustración
En no tener tus labios para que me des
Un besito chiquita porfavor te necesito

Te necesito a mi lado para siempre
Te necesito en mi vida lo mas urgente
Te necesito como quiero estar contigo
Te necesito no me dejes en el olvido

El otro dia que picardia
Que no se diga tu estabas
En el cine y no sabias

Que atras de ti yo estava muy calladito
Espiando para ver que requisito
Si no eres para mi dimelo ya basta con
Los juegos chiquita

Tu sonrisa y tu aroma alimenta
A mi pobre corazón que no encuentra
El amor en este triste universo
Chiquita por favor haz un esfuerzo
Por que vida sin ti no ay apetito
Reyna de mi corazon te necesito

Te necesito los 7 dias de la semana
Te necesito mi corazon no te engaña
Te necesito cada vez que yo respiro
Te necesito ya no puedo estar herido

Me pierdo caminando pensando en ti
Cada paso que doy no estas ahi
Admito que estoy enamorado
Vaya a donde vaya estoy juzgado

Ya no quiero aguantar este dolor
Mi cara ha perdido su color
Me arrepiento del dia en que te vi
Caminando a dos pasos de mi

No tuve el valor en decirte con miedo
Que podia aburrirte
Por que el amor que tengo
Es infinito darling
Entiende te necesito

Te necesito a mi lado para siempre
Te necesito en mi vida lo mas urgente
Te necesito como quiero estar contigo
Te necesito no me dejes en el olvido

Te necesito los 7 dias de la semana
Te necesito mi corazon no te engaña
Te necesito cada vez que yo respiro
Te necesito ya no puedo estar herido

Todos nos dicen no nos quieren aqui
Hey think without a Mexican you will be feliz
Pasen sus leyes, dijanos mojados

Hay muchos mas estados donde hemos llegado
No nos quieren dar licencia ni siquiera un ID
Pero cobran sus impuestos cada 15 de abril

Mas fuerza nos daremos pa' seguir luchando

Conozco a otro a un mas peor
Le decimos el paisano simplemente de cariño
A veces discrimina peor que un gringo

No es fiel a su pasado, chicano equivocado
Tuvo la fortuna de llegar antes que yo
De Juan se hizo Jonhs se le olvido el español

También en la familia hay celos y envidia
En vez de ayudarnos tapamos la salida
Competimos por la chamba

El carro mas perron
La barriga mas llena
La hija mas bonita
El rancho mas grande

Solo asi conquistaremos that's right
No hay raza mejor que la mia
Unidos alcanzaremos pase nuestra vida
Tenemos el deber de mejorar este pais
Mostrar nuestra cultura y la manera de vivir

No dejar que taco bell represente al Mexicano
Que nuestros hijos no abandonen su pasado
Que se vayan de casita cuando es hora de estudiar
No importa solo asi van a triunfar

Que terminen la high school y la universidad
Que no se rompan la espalda, al trabajar
Unidos no vencidos, a lo que venimos
Hace falta plata en el pais, buscar otro camino

Es gacho pero cierto pa' el gobierno de aqui
Nos es suficiente que suframos, nos quieren destruir

Jaël,"I really wanted to go
It hurt me too much to stay
I run away so fast
That my heart couldn't find a way
And then you came along
And I was tired of my sadness
It seemed as though my life went on
But the feeling didn't last

[Chorus:]
And then you came along
And then it's gone
Saving my life from going on (lost and found)
Thinking of what else you could have done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)
Holding on to everything that's gone
Saving my life from going on (lost and found)
Thinking of what else you could have done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)

I was back on my feet
You could say I was barely walking
But the cut was deep
And I was holding on to the past

[Chorus]

He had stolen my illusions
And I needed them so badly
I grew tired of my confusion
'Cause he was still there
Everywhere (everywhere)

You came along, and I was lost and found (lost and found)
Lost and found, my life went on, but I was lost and found
You came along when I was stuck in the past
There was a new life in sight
But I was blind

Jag Panzer,"[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

When your love exists no more it's time to find another door
Rekindling flames that have gone dim, let feelings spread on a whim
Look toward the light and fix your eyes, let the white dove fly
When your love exists no more it's time to find another door

Hearts are dry it's time they burn
The wheel of life has stopped its turn
Pound the flesh unto the tree
Bound and hung before me
Cast your lots unto him now
Search your hearts before the bow
Life's too short, why throw away
Save the best for the final day

Bleed into the world of sin
The blood will flow to the hearts within
Agonizing pain and death
Well, it's burning everything that's left
Kneel before the one so true
He's the king of all and even you
Darkness ruling everyone
Praising another as the one true son

Burn his number into the flesh
666 the final test
See the mark sweep the land
On the forehead, on the hand
Hang the one that we all know
Crucify the inner soul
Sell your soul unto the maker
The Crucifix

Jag Panzer,"Scrambled signals on the radio
Orders are given to attack
Flames light the sky from over the hill
No time for turning back
Well, the blood lust runs cold inside my veins
Twisting tormenting my mind
I feel a scream from deep inside
It lets me know I'm the killin' kind

Gonna yell, unleash this demon rage
Scream, I'm a tiger in a cage
Yell, I'm on the prowl again
Scream

A soldier on the streets somewhere in L.A.
Preparing this night for the attack
Swinging chains and switchblade knives
Feel the nails in my baseball bat
Well, I love to fight, I love to screw
Feel my heat begin to rise
Don't walk the street at night, my friend
Or you're in for a surprise

Playing on the sheets of untold sin
Who can tell what the darkness withholds
Spread your wings and we can fly
Bodies ready to explode
Touch me, thrill me, you can scratch me, love
Get me in your stranglehold
Well, you make me moan, I'll make you yell

Out bursting with rage
Overflowing force of desire

No wonder why you wakin' up up swollen

I'm feelin' you Luda', smokin' my buddha, coochie recruiter

On the back and leave it drippin' down the crack of her ass

Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin' the buttons off yo' blouse
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' house

And I hope we be the same thang, freaks
We can get the mattress goin' 'eh-err, eh-err'
Handlin' business while I bang bang, skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes

Come up out yo' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times, but it's seven today

Ahh, ahh! What's my name?
So magical I come and touch the game

Nothin' but hatin' and a look of disgust
Always a must, stay ""Adrenaline Rush""
Wonderin' why they don't be bustin' the same

I'm clutchin' my thang
Stuffin' in it, strokin' it down, beat the stuff up
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off
I can tell her style by the way that she walks
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels
Pullin' rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag before I tap it

Makin' you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin' me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin', up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin' wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin' slapped up

But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get together
Because now you gots to ride out, bitch

Hit skins, causin' catastrophes

Sip gin, fulfillin' your fantasies
In your condition I'm wishin' you'll take a lickin'
And keep on tickin' from thicker thighs
Finger lickin' never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes

Will they be around when you need them the most?

You can call me, I'll be right there.
When you're feeling down, no one's around,
You can call me, I'll be right there.

In the shelves, and the plush hotel after every show

Of MTV and the radio
And so you jay and me said ""it's 83'""

That it's guaranteed that I'm for you, and you for me

Call her about five hundred times a day
When I'm often gone cause I'm on the road
And when I'm on the phone, you know I want to be home
Cause that's the one and only spot where I really belong

On the dance floor straight cutting it up

Type of playa but it ain't
It just sounds like that
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
(I agree)
Hit the movies, hit the mall
Then come out with big bags
Next day do lunch then head Six Flags
But it don't mean nothin we're just having some fun
Even though I may have told you on the ride you're the one
I'm sorry little shorty I gotta take that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that

Even if you're three years older than me
And caught yourself noticing me
In my mind, set don't change
I might up my game
But the story that I tell 'em
When I tell it, it remains the same
You wouldn't believe how they be coming at me
Steady, steady tryna throw something at me
Like I'mma get happy
Just because honey got her learner's permit
Can come and scoop me after school
Like I'm supposed to be on it
Naw ain't no sippin' over here
It's Big Pimpin' over here
And I hope that I make myself clear
That when it comes to honeys yo I got some minutes
And I ain't tryna get serious till I'm up in my twenties
It's just the paper that I'm after
The drop with the top I'mma cop when I'm able
And that's all that matters
So if I told you something shorty
I'm taking that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that

'cause the love we get, we gots to be dreaming baby, know what I mean, JE yo, all the time. 

She came to me like a vision in the night
Thought I was wrong but I had to be right
I just can't believe that you're the real thing
And I'm trying to figure out this feeling
Was it a dream or you're just that right
Smile like bling and a body so tight
Let a brotha know how you feel, 'cause I've been lookin' for a girl that's real. 

When they say that they be lookin' for the real men
Always claiming that they want the fuckin' real thing...

(You the one I wanted all my life, baby tell me are you just that right yeah) 
 
Must be something bout the way you work that body, thinkin' bout you like your my hottie. 

(So I want to be with you, baby tell me have I dreamed you.

Thought I dreamed you, one night when I closed my eyes
Can't believe that you're really mine
Told myself a thousand times, that's why I thought you dreamed you
I ain't never been this lucky, girl like you, with a dude like me
You're the just to good to be true, thought I dreamed you. 

Girl I believe in love at first sight, even though I saw you in a dream one night
Girl you were sent to change me life, I know it's real
I dreamt about twice, so if you're lonely need someone to hold you, call me up
And baby girl I'm a come through
I got the thing you feel up in your knees, and baby you're the only one for me.

Fabolous...he doesn't have that problem

He always tells the truth
That's what it's all about?
That's what we work so hard for Fabolous?
So they can point their fucking fingers
and call me the fucking bad guy?

I guess I'm the bad guy
The fingers is pointing
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in
They be asking fellas why (why?)

It's cause the streets is watching
With an envious ear, jealous eye
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin
I keep the home ??? two way contact for Johnny Cochran

Be the same dudes, testing your patience
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments

These playas been playin' foul
And I done learned my lesson with flagrants
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment

You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'

But non of these slut bitches
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail

I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters

Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real

What type of bad guy give fellas ???, females hugs
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs

I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong
'Cause even if I get locked
My money won't let me stay unrighteous for wrong

Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club it's cool
But don't change the subject fool

And start askin if I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me

I don't care what other haters do
But if you think I'm loved for saving you

cut-off shirts and jeans was your only way seen. 
What I had didn't matter, it was all about us, 
all day on the phone and the stuff we discussed. 
I used to come over when your mom was gone. 
We didn't know what we were doing but we got our freak on. 
One thing led to another, I introduced you 
to my mother like ""ma, this my girl."" 
That was when it started getting real, 
feeling kept getting caught, gifts 
started being bought and everybody knew the deal. 
We used to hang out, kiss, argue and all that. 
Hang up the phone and call right back.

Feel like I'm chasing, wasting time on you
If you're really through that's cool
Don't hang up the phone as I pour my soul
It's been about two years, had fears
But girl I had to call you
I had to stop my drinking, smoking
Even stopped my balling
I heard that why'all broke up
Hope that you ain't too choked up
One day I just woke on up
Baby can we be tight...

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Can we be tight?
I want to be there for you all I can
Can we be tight again?
I know you just got over your man
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again?
Again, again

I know that going on without someone you love can be so hard and
I know it's cause of him girl that you just can't let down your guard and
I know your relationship with him ain't work
It ain't like I'm the only jerk
Give me one more chance, girl I'll make it work
'Cause every day that I live
It seems I learn a lot more about women in general
They just want to be loved, just want to be hugged and kiss, be included
Every heart got a glitch
Every dog got it's bitch
Every man got a whip
Mine is you, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Can we be tight?
I want to be there for you all I can
Can we be tight again?
I know you just got over your man
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again?
Again, again

(Repeat 2X)
Can we be, can we be tight
Messed up in the past
And baby now I know better
Can we be, can we be tight
Give me one more chance
Girl I know I'll do it better

Can we be tight?
I want to be there for you all I can
Can we be tight again?
I know you just got over your man
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again?

We gonna let you in on a little Southern lingo

Is that what they saying?
(Cut something, cut something)
(Cut something on the low-low)

Check it out
Cut a nigga for the low-low
I'm fixin' to cut a nigga from the So So
I heard you cut a nigga from the DTP, you got DDT
From College Park to the DEC
See we be sittin' on low pros
Shippin' ass in by the boatloads
Not many people can see the cheese
Better run they g's
Ludacris and the Pimp MC's, JE

[JE]
To all of y'all who don't know
Let me explain
What cuttin' is, and how it go
Gotta know the game
Cause you can say the wrong thing
To the wrong girl, with the wrong man
And, let's just say it might be a long night

The first thing you should know
Do she get down?
Now if she's even feeling you
Is she worth your while?
Had this girl I met the other day
She was feelin' me, I was feelin' her
And I couldn't believe what she said

She said cut something
She looked at me, I looked at her
I said ""Ain't Nothin""
Couldn't believe what I just heard
She was not frontin'
I like my woman kind of bold
She was oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
She said cut somethin'
I'm peepin' you, you're peepin' me
So let's stop playin'
She said ""You ain't never had a girl like me""
Who will make you feel like this
So we can go after the show
Baby cut something, we should cut something
Don't be scared

See usually I never mess with a girl who steps
Up to me before I even get the chance
Let a woman be a woman, let a man be a man see
And that's the way I like it baby
Now I always make exceptions to every rule
This one I had to let on in, she was hella cool
She liked to do things that men would really want and
This is what she said, hey

[Chorus]

A lot of things have changed in life
Cause now women go out on the prowl
Baby harder than men
I know when I figured it out
When this girl walked up
She said cut something, something
Ain't like I'm trippin' about it
I just remember when a man could be a man baby
And yes, I still can't believe what she said

[Ludacris]
Yo she said she needed me to beat it
And beat it, beat it, then skeet it
She greeted with an open tongue
With Coke and Rum, got her so excited
She screamin' at the top of her lungs
She just can't hide it
I'm poppin' her gums, cock my popular gun
Shoot, shoot, lick, lick from the head to the toes
Head to the floor, head till their ain't no head no mo'
Cut till it ain't no bed no mo'
Cut till you pussy don't beg no mo'

It's okay to check in that Motel 6
$59.95, not a cent more for that dirty-ass hoe

Get that cut up! Oh-whooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the L.A.C
So later on we'll be rollin'
Drop tops, I'm hittin' yo' hot spots, I'm top notch
My niggas never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin' game at the A.U.C

Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that
No wonder why you wakin' up up swollen

I'm feelin' you Luda', smokin' my buddha, coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
On the back and leave it drippin' down the crack of her ass
Call me Mr. Magilla-cutty, chasin' booty soft as silly putty
Killa for money, still a thug get bump
From slow pokin' to locomotion, hittin' bunnies, for threesomes getcha buddy
When I'm feelin' scummy I love to cut, 10-4

Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin' the buttons off yo' blouse
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' house
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south
Hot fellatio, hot jalapenos, holla while they in yo' mouth
So we love that c-c-c-c

And I hope we be the same thang, freaks
We can get the mattress goin' 'eh-err, eh-err'
Handlin' business while I bang bang, skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes

Come up out yo' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times, but it's seven today

Ahh, ahh! What's my name?
So magical I come and touch the game
You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin' but hatin' and a look of disgust
Always a must, stay ""Adrenaline Rush""
Wonderin' why they don't be bustin' the same

I'm clutchin' my thang
Stuffin' in it, strokin' it down, beat the stuff up
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off
I can tell her style by the way that she walks
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels
Pullin' rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag before I tap it

Hit skins, causin' catastrophes
Get pinned, by me and my family
Sip gin, fulfillin' your fantasies
In your condition I'm wishin' you'll take a lickin'
And keep on tickin' from thicker thighs
Finger lickin' never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes
And you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that c-c-c-c

Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do

For times when my life feels so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I love the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruption when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

[Chorus]

I got the rock in my hands
ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders want to sing

[Chorus]

Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

Something I don't wanna miss. 
Its your skin, its your lips, 
It feels like such a gift. 
If it's up to me we'd be here the whole night through, 
Till the morning

[Chorus]
In the morning, when we wake up, 
You'll be lookin' at me so peacefully, 
Like this is where I need to be. 
In the morning when we wake up we'll be together together, 
You know there's nothing better. 
In the morning when we wake up, 
You'll be looking at me so peacefully 
Got your day started so crazy, 
Baby, you know, 
There ain't nothin' like just bein' with you.
In the morning

I love how you look, 
Even when you get up.
You're so lovely with them rolleres and no makeup . 
And I cant believe at the end of the day, 
I still gotta say that you're my special lady. 
The mornings kinda tough,
With no coffee in my cup. 
The way that you be loving me, 
Its hard to just get up. 
I cant start my day alone. 
There's is nothing like just being with you 
In the morning

Feel a rush when you sleep, I can't get enough. 
When you're loving me, sometimes its way too much. 
I know I'd be wrong if I didn't take care of you. 
I know I'd be wrong if I didn't want to marry you.
It's your touch and your kiss, 
Something I don't wanna miss. 
Its your skin, its your lips, 
It feels like such a gift.

Day or night baby, I'll be yours. 
But in the morning, 

[Chorus]

I cant make a day at my job long, 
Without trying to run home. 
Phone it gets gets me all the way through the day, 
But it gets me half way. 
I cant worry 'bout where my boys be going, 
I'ma be right at home. 
And I wouldn't miss it for nothin', 
Just for that morning time, morning time.",In the Morning,2003

She's everything I dreamed that a woman could be
She sends all of my senses into a whirlwind

She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
It's been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party want to get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
It's lookin' so fat, we at the party

Flights I don' flew some alone

But would it hurt me to holla,
Lil' momma hot,
And she got all the signature features her momma got,

Listen momma I'm tired of switching label lets consider dating,
No chasing no wasting ya time, the pleasures mine,
I'ma show you how to shine just sit back and recline,
Cause the ride on stilts my back on swow,

And wheater you knew it or not,

And watch a movie if you say it's alright (alright)
Hey little mama,
I'm digging ya smile, 
Loving ya style,
Lil' mama you should kick it wit Bow,

I was thinking I could come over,
And chill wit you tonight and sit next to you on ya sofa,
And maybe pop in a DVD,
And make some popcorn just for you and me,
But see I been on tour for a minute,
I want to come home and settle down for a minute,
You feel me,
If you wit it then let me know,
And if you say yes that you wit it then that's fo sho,
Cause see I came to arrange some things,
I'm talking pick you up from school and arranging things,
You know this dog likes to roam,
But you know I can't come over when ya pops is home,
I think it's about time for you to hang up the phone,
Ya father probably got his ear to the door,
So,
It's best to tell ya I'll just holla tomorrow,

New age, and a new page
In a book of life but it's looking like
Y'all ain't ready for the new phase
Then I'ma get more mature
Make mistakes, but hey
Everybody did that before
Ever feel like you've been trapped before
Wish you can open up a magic door

The way that you feel it but cha'll confuse it

But this is life I'm bound to go thought it
It's a process y'all gotta digest
Let the boy grow up, want to go out
Have a little fun, if it get a lil' wild, 
Then so what
It's an ounce of experience
Just more than a pine of advice

An it's like, I'm so curious about life 
I'm movin' on

So don't compare me to other thirteen year old's

First impression of a young adalesson 
A grown up mind that flow so impressive
Grew up so fast in this profession
A flash of concerts and late night sessions
So much dough, he don't know it's a blessin'
The way he brag, he gon' last one second
But oh contrea don't stop and stare
If I sell my jewelry and cut my hair
Still be here after y'all
Stand this all, I ain't had a chance to ball
So when you doubt me I'll just laugh at cha'll 
Shouting out,fall in love, it ain't a plans at all
But ain't no tellin'
When there's no more sellin' other record end up 
Wit a pen label ends up a record nah
But I still got act in basketball
So if you ain't checkin' for me
I ain't checkin' for y'all
So
Let this be a lesson to y'all 
When a rap acteace
Play professional ball
No matter who you get a rights 
Or who you listening to
You get one life ain't nobody livin' but you

All before the drama begun
When we first met

I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
But I'll start with ya name
You told me how ya man playing games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I was glad that I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really girl it ain't no rush
I was thinking girl that we can discuss
A future for us
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust

I just want to talk
I'm thinking I can give you a call
And we can pick it up

You except and go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart

And homey there he just front and pretend
But you don't care the life he leads
Is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase

First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about
I can't figure you out
Even your friend said I was better
But you listen to him
Never like uh-uh whatever

Remember that
Now that you gone
It's been kinda hard
Can't think, can't sleep
Can't do nothing at all
Just tell me why you had to go back
See you ain't have to go through that

You could've been here right by my side

For messing up the blessing he gave to me, I see
Everything clearer now
The nights as black as black as it's ever been, without my girl
I'm losing
And I pray that he just sheds his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby

It feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feel like I done damn near thrown my life away, yeah yea
Like a child that's lost their temper
Don't know what to do
It feels like I just walked right out of heaven

See my momma told me that if it's meant to be
She'll come back
But, the best thing I can do
Is to just let her (let her) go
I know
I don't
Want to do it
But if I continue to push

Jagged Edge,"Throw your hands in the sky, nigga
I'm stickin' ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hard core, harder than a Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with the spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized 'cause I love to see niggaz die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin' ""He was a good man""
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis
Ya fuck with the high guy ya die
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin' ""Look up in the sky!""

Fuck the sluts with the big humongous butts
Huh, I use a rubber, but
My style is gushy like the hooker's pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me
Into flamin' 'em like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggaz in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em, I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggaz don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the dra-ma

I like you and I like your style
Don't rush, we can wait a while (everything you need)
One day we can walk the aisle
Baby you're my, princess

Don't glance at the jewels, you can't afford this
My wrist your car note, my chain your mortgage
I go downtown and lick, my tongue searchin'
My head between your legs, I eat your fur-burger
Mama our sex game's on a whole 'nother level
I did ruff on the roof, and I nicknamed her Pebbles
So girl deep throat, or take off your blouse
In the speedboat, in back of my house

So you could come to my condo and watch a movie
But I'm tired of you sayin' that you not a groupie
You my project princess, diamonds and princess
Leave your man, cause ma you been stressed
And I love when you wear that real thin dress
You my mistress, matter fact princess
I buy you diamonds 'til your neck feels senseless
Or fly the world in brand new Leer jet

I ain't tryin' to be your buddy and
Your body I been studyin' (yeah)
And your friends they be hatin' and
I scoop you up for the weekend (oh oh)
Your love I been tryin' to win
One knee in front of all your friends (yeah)
Your love I can't afford to miss
These so-called playas wouldn't tell you this

Ha ha, ma you know you my princess
Um, I mean, I take you to see Jacob
Beth in Jersey, you know, Ice Man in L.A

Said we all can change, yes
Don't be afraid of the change, no

And everytime the seasons change, oh we do too
Nothing remains the same, neither should me and you
Gotta have faith in the way...
In the way that He moves as the seasons change

We need a change, yes we do
We all can change, yes we can
And I know it's all in you, its in me too

When the seasons change, oh, we don't stay the same
Oh, we could use a break from the hurt and pain
When the seasons change, I know we could do the same
We could shed our leaves, with sunlight we could grow today
When the seasons change

Winter, spring, summer to the fall
Baby by now we been through it all
It ain't no summer if you'll be gone (Ain't no summer)
And I know that we both can change (Oh Yes we can)
Yes we can... ain't' no doubt in my mind oh no that we both can change

Now maybe we should change the flaws in ourselves
Sometimes we not even real with ourselves
Every little change ain't perfect, but it helps
We can do it, you know it... and you'll see the seasons change

We need a change
When the seasons change I ain't afraid to change
We need a change... We all can change
Ohh
Said it's time for change... we need to change
When the seasons change, I ain't afraid to change
Oh we need a change... we all can change",Seasons Change,2006

I was at the mall
Getting fresh for the weekend
When I caught a glance of some heavy tweekin'
Seen her straight from the back
Couldn't wait for this girl to turn around

Had the skin perfect match that
She round in the back you know I likes that
Trying to floss like a movie

Been known to put it down anyplace I be
You can copy but it's only goin' be one me
I don't ride in no cars till a man come wit me
14 and i started up a whole epidemic
Look, y'all know what I'm talking about
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south
TV shows, magazine covers
Girls in groups saying, ""We go with each other.""
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake
What you know about selling tres mil out the gate?
I'm the hottest thing around
Neck full of bling, bling like the Neptune sound
I got it locked on the left, right, front and rear

The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know

I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges off Different Strokes
I was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time
Like the number 2-3 in the red and black
Mr. 106 & Park is back, holla!
I do it like no other
And attract mo' family than Ringling Brothers
I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like hash browns
See I'm the best just ask around
I'm here now, and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can
You better off gettin' a shirt, makin' a sign that reads
""Shad Moss, I'm yo number 1 fan!""

I said Lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home

I want to thank y'all man
From the bottom of my heart
Secondly I want to
Dedicate this song to y'all
Cause without y'all
There is no me
(Lil' Bow Wow:)
I can never turn
My back on y'all
Cause y'all put me
Where I'm at
So when ya call
I'll be there just like that
Signing autographs 
Giving dash to all my folks
Telling little kids
""Don't follow this dopes""
See I'ma keep barking and
Cause y'all bark wit' me
You know the website
All ya gotta do is hit me now
As much as the girls like me
You would think
You'd make the fellas sick
But they'd be right wit' 'em
Singing not listen the lick
Hair braided
Rockin' somebody's jersey
From up top that out west
And down in the dirty
Can't forget about the mid-west 
That's where I was found
That's where I live
That Columbus is the town
I got the paint, you got the paper
A CD, and tape
I signin' and be able to get
A nice big plate of fish
Which is my favorite dish
But without y'all
I couldn't kick it like this

[Chorus]

[Jagged Edge and Fundisha]
I want to thank you
For making me
Who I am
And puttin' me
Where I need to be
I want to thank you 
For the opportunity to
Do my thing in this industry
I want to thank you
For calling to your local stations
To everybody to play my song
If it wasn't for you
There wouldn't be no me
And that's why
I'm gonna rock for you
Forever more

I want to thank you
For the proofs that
Came before me
All of y'all and the office that
Promote me on the street 
All the mom and pops gone
That don't get a lot of credit
This spots in the hood
The first one to sell it
All the mix show DJ's
Please keep it pumping
Thank you for your support
And yes, I'm gonna
Keep it coming
I love how you love that
So I'm giving back
Cause y'all the ones that
Kept this player on track
The reason I'm seeing is
Because of you
The reason I'm heard and
My dreams came true
Now if you ever made a poster
Or wrote a fan letter
All I'm tryin' to do is
Show you some L-O-V-E
And let you know without y'all 
There is no me
J.D., J.E., the whole S.S.D.
Now if you rock for we
Then I'ma rock for you
From the bottom of my heart
Baby tell 'em what I want to do

 Energy gone my insides dyin' out
 Wishin' you was dead or somewhere lyin' out
 Every time you open ya mouth lies flyin' out
 Remember when we first met you wit' ya crew
 Me wit' my girls doin' what we usually do
 You wit' ya game comin' at me askin' my name
 Knew it was love first sight you said it the same 
 Talked on the phone the whole night vibe feelin' so right
 Every step pointin' to love the future so bright 
 Till this girl in my class told me she was pregnant 
 And that you was the dad
 How she wasn't jealous of me or nothin' I had 
 How you cheated on her several times and treated her bad
 And as she was tellin' me that my whole world collapsed
 Feelin' like a fool still in love wit' you
 
 [Chorus (2x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 What tricks you gon' play now 
 Nothin' you could say 'cause everything is clear now 
 I can see where I made my mistakes 
 Stayin' home a good girlfriend gimmie a break 
 I'd be home alone callin' you catchin' the shakes
 Every minute till you call back adrealine raced
 Left me hangin' on my birthday when I stayed at ya place 
 You came home the next morning
 I just stared in ya face
 Knew where you was actin' dumb it tore me apart
 Took it out on your things put the key to your car
 Felt like you had a knife all this pain in my heart
 Deep down though still wishin' we could restart
 For a second I was on top swore I had the cream
 Rude awakeing nothin' come to sleepers but a dream 
 It's sinkin' in never really loved me and it seemed 
 What was I thinking I was only in my teens
 
 [Chorus (2x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 Nowadays when I see you I don't feel bad
 Got a real love in my life you be a real dad
 For once in ya life try doin' somethin' right
 By now you should be ready to slow it down
 'cause you know what go 'round come back 'round
 Even though it hurt to let you go I had to roll
 A demon in disguise you was tryna take my soul
 Couldn't make a move you was tryna take control
 In a way I could only balme myself naive
 I made the choice to be wit' you and no one else indeed
 A picture in a broken frame upon the shelf indeed
 Had to take a lil' time to know myself 
 Every now and then and then I start to reminisce wantin' ya kiss
 Even though I know it's dangerous 
 Every now and then I start to reminisce 
 For real even though I know it's so dangerous
 
 [Chorus (4x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life

 What a chick gotta do to get some love?
 What I gotta do to say enough is enough?
 
 What's the point of bein' wit somebody, that only bring ya down

Here's what you want right
Here's what you need right
We got to give you more
Of what you're lookin' for

So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years
Exclusive type, only for your eyes and ears
You held it in for so long you bursted into tears
The letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere
Well I ain't, the bullshit begins here
The obvious cause, the effects is unclear
The punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
Though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear
You deep now, submerged with no signs of air
Still your sunken heart thumpin' like the kick in a snare
While on the surface it's all turnin' to a circus
That's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be
Cause if somebody woulda done that shit to me
I mean my best man hittin' my wife-to-be
My sentiments exactly would be history
Why'know what I'm sayin my peoples in the place let's hit it off one two

[Chorus]

Yo, it's like nothin' changed, it's all the same thang
The same characters in a book, with different names
It's a lot more to lose than you got to gain
You a lot more confused than hip to the game
The peep the script of the game the price is pain
Men and women get into things, now who's to blame?
When everybody whisperi'n bout whatever took place
And how the fact twist a knot with a straight face
And lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste
Well that's a point in the past that can't be erased
So motivate, though it's hard to let it ride
Or set aside true feelings, underhand dealings
Our lost trust, I wonder if we lost us
It's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous
So I'ma, just calm down and try to relax
Before I clap ????????

[Chorus]

If you could only flash back and undo our actions
Change what happens, dissect the fractions
A time to rewind and be recorded absent
For real cause these memories is photographic
Pornographic, pushing me close to madness
Head heavy like I'm trippin' on tablets
Yesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so
But now it feel like shots hittin' my torso
Spent a lotta time and trust in the wrong place
Fought a lotta fights rollin' with the wrong ace
Love, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace
I need, room the think, and space to ventilate
Was solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate
Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place

Buckshot:

I woke up in the night
grabbed my forehead
wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
thinking of a way to strapped
and walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That when i drop a rhyme I I make it hard enough to gain
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the L ignite
Fight, I take you on flight here
The war starts here.

Keep your shit hot

To all the Godz who know who's the coloured man
the colored man is the obvious, you understand?
I kill him, and drill 'I'm in my bootcamp
Who can't survive in the creek?
You can't
Champion, bootcampian click
stick and move
I bust your shit
Move and stick
It's the original crook
Stomping through your army, what!
Gortex to your head
Keep your eyes shut
But, I'll take you in consideration
My occupation is to bust your federation
with my ammunition
Flipping precision, being precise
He's right, I'm nice
You can check my status and my apparatus
See the baddest Buckshot shot the boodah
Murder hero to clean your pipe like Ruger
Smoke a bag of charm then I drop the bomb,
Buckshot I represent the Arm Leg Leg Arm
Head, natty dread, boy big him up
Roll thick like syrup
cause chaos and terror

Chorus

I had a vision
It appeared to me in the form of a devil
but the rebel wasn't there to see
for me this is the year to be
the son of the seven, representing the sea
the heatseeker
the cypher maker
quick to take a
sec to re-a-lize, I burn right through you
Double gauge
I'm pointing the rage at your culu

We blew the motherfucker
Now we outta here.

It was 1:30, my face was all dirty trying to get some sleep
Head still whirling, throw on my shearing leave my man home
Two dots yes I'm coming, yes my car is running, hang up my cell phone

By the time I arrived you was deep about five like you had beef
And then you tried to step and told me that I slept like you was cock deez
It was all about some niggaz that you thought was jigga
Who was digging me and I told you after that day we ain't cool baby, so

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

I was kinda thrown head was kinda blown but I'm not blue
Lost a couple friends once or twice before, I'm still cool
Then you tried to flex like you were the next bitch who you trying to fool
You just another girl from the avenue who graduated school

Now you wanna be down after you tried to clown me baby doll
But ain't no future in fronting and frontiers
Don't hang around with me at all
And now I make my music got me some new dick and I'm doing fine
And I'm still real ghetto and I still kick your black behind

Dreaming deep concentration hazy
She really couldn't peep what they was saying
At first all I know was Jag really wasn't playing at all

She left calming to speak to the John
Got the Jaguar double parked, blinkers is on
Head pulled back sneakers is on
Yo I don't know what sis told her
But she bout' to get a beatin' performed

She grabbing all up on her shirt tugging on her slacks
Jag tried to go in the grill I had to hold her back
Cool her out try to tell her to chill, lower the thermostat

Scrapping over men is best avoided
And a real lady would never confess to doing it
She said I'm ganstar don't let the dress confuse you
The only things sweet is the music, it's really not a game

He taught me life was culture baby
My uncle David they call him Jello the only man that could say hello
And it sound like angels singing in your ear
And even though they all passed away I still long for their company

Then be a grown man and stand up on your own two and love yourself
If your girlfriend?s is on welfare, then baby walk away
You don't have to care and love yourself
And if standing on the corner and pushing rocks up in your sock 
Ain't what you want to do to night then love yourself

Grandma asked me what I'm running for
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
What mothers birth their youngens for
And some say Jesus coming for
For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast 'cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barbers barred, barred of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A man to de-fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter vs. spirit, through meditation
I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation

Yes he is, oh, yes indeed

Here's what you want right
Here's what you need right
We got to give you more
Of what you're lookin' for

So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years
Exclusive type, only for your eyes and ears
You held it in for so long you bursted into tears
The letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere
Well I ain't, the bullshit begins here
The obvious cause, the effects is unclear
The punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
Though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear
You deep now, submerged with no signs of air
Still your sunken heart thumpin' like the kick in a snare
While on the surface it's all turnin' to a circus
That's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be
Cause if somebody woulda done that shit to me
I mean my best man hittin' my wife-to-be
My sentiments exactly would be history
Why'know what I'm sayin my peoples in the place let's hit it off one two

[Chorus]

Yo, it's like nothin' changed, it's all the same thang
The same characters in a book, with different names
It's a lot more to lose than you got to gain
You a lot more confused than hip to the game
The peep the script of the game the price is pain
Men and women get into things, now who's to blame?
When everybody whisperi'n bout whatever took place
And how the fact twist a knot with a straight face
And lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste
Well that's a point in the past that can't be erased
So motivate, though it's hard to let it ride
Or set aside true feelings, underhand dealings
Our lost trust, I wonder if we lost us
It's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous
So I'ma, just calm down and try to relax
Before I clap ????????

[Chorus]

If you could only flash back and undo our actions
Change what happens, dissect the fractions
A time to rewind and be recorded absent
For real cause these memories is photographic
Pornographic, pushing me close to madness
Head heavy like I'm trippin' on tablets
Yesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so
But now it feel like shots hittin' my torso
Spent a lotta time and trust in the wrong place
Fought a lotta fights rollin' with the wrong ace
Love, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace
I need, room the think, and space to ventilate
Was solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate
Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place

The problems which confront us today are unprecedented 
They have no counterparts in human experience 
Men search the pages of history for solutions, for precedents, but there are none
This, then, is the ultimate challenge
Where are we to look for our survival?
For the answers to the questions which have never before been posed?

We must look, first, to Almighty
Who has raised man above the animals and endowed him with intelligence and reason
And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls 
We must become something we have never been
And for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us 
We must become bigger than we have been
More courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook
We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice 
Owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community",Hardcore,2016

[Cee-Lo]
Shit, behold it is me, it is the epitome of extraterrestrial energy
Experiment and enter the internals of the inner me
The art of gone, and heart of stone, and own's worst enemy

Intellect shapeshifta, God's gift a Soul slippa
Hone in on clones and blow them out of my zone
International Fanatical, the radical tactical movements
Sounds are congruent to it

Work

It is what it ain't to these, infected disease
Thought of automatons deceived, by the deceptions indeed
Who mechanically breed at methodical speeds
Distorting your genes, aborting your dreams
As coarse as it seems

Aiyyo, Work

[Cee-Lo]
I could scream, I can't seem to sleep long enough to dream
It's life on a laser beam
But I fiend for the future at my finger tips
One of the minor technicalities of my head trips

You Better Work

The Barea Soul terror, been told since stories of old
Come on let's go and then I'll show how to beat down a rhyme
And wrestle a tempo
Hold on tight, but still let yourself go

Work

This is what I'm talking about
Should I begin to spit it just like the wind
Show my power take flight and quickly ascend
Like a bird beating my wings to the pulse of nature
Scaring spiritual devils while evoking the maker
Is it wrong for me to curse in the name of right
Is it wrong for me to spit life into this mic
That's all I'm asking baby
How come the new millennium brings fright
Something wicked approaches tonight

Work

It's automatic, static battle star galactic
Microhard
It's the upgraded, complicated, premeditated
Microhard
It's the transplanted, peaceful panic, bass mechanic
Microhard
It's the psychotic, mean melodic, nod-narcotic
Microhard
(repeat)

What good is a call on the phone if you can't speak
And you find it hard to breathe
Paralyzed by my essence, mere presence I put forth
Inherently legends record all souls of expressions
Evil as evil does, better than good was
A spirit of music that once was, born out of the pool of your love
Baby I'm an agent with a flow that's so contagious
And all and all true patience, my brotha Lo told me makes for perfection
While you feeling bound by this matrix
That's why when it comes to protecting mine
I'm a brother you can call over zealous
And I lust and thrust out my staff and wet
Till the motherfuckin' rains get jealous

You Gotta Work

It's not coincidental I use my soul for a stencil to outline the rhyme
That connects machine and a mind
Until the end of time the one my kind, the message will now be profoundly
Spoken, rules are meant to be broken, therefore it's my pleasure to mentor
But once learned you must learn you must yearn to discern
The mechanical glitch of artificial intelligence
But the consequence of your ignorance is the reality I now see before me:
""maybe in time we'll see""

Don't Stop, Work

The degree you'll see will 'cause casualty when the codes download
The truth will unfold uphold until the end
'Cause our destiny will be to win, you're still free to sin within

I am the melody, the metaphoric prehistoric
The pre-meaning before it, preparing for war shit
Their god's only a graphic, the sky's computer blue
There is a moral malfunction, what will the machine do to you
They maliciously monopolize the mass
Niggas sleep rap and fuck they surprise you last
When you sell them your soul they supply you cash
But you can die for all they care, with your expendable ass
Because they know a new nigga, a brand new nigga
Will jump right in them tap shoes even if his feet bigger
Ain't shit sweet nigga, it's deeper than the street nigga
You and I just a virus they gonna delete nigga
Some people say go on and join what you can't beat nigga
I won't take the mark so I can't eat nigga
Holla if I'm talking to ya, (AH!)
I'll walk straight through ya
'Cause I want the motherfucker that did this to ya

Our comrade Cee-Lo is considered by many as a modern day Neo
And opposing forces known as agents will like him dead for what he know
He is The One, at least that's who Morpheus say he is
He can free the mind of a machine and give God to an atheist
But he's a daydreamer, it's all in his head
Still today's music has become the Matrix
And the real rhythm is in the red pill
So I chose it knowing I can never return once I'm gone
And I hope you got this message
I'll be waiting by the phone

So I light my candles pray 
That this world can still be saved 
That It's not to late for peace be

And you swear that it's over
It seems you've pack your bags like every night

We could be so much more

But everytime the smallest thing goes wrong girl
You're out the door

Why can't you understand that somethings
Won't come easy in life

Say I've let you down
That I no longer know you
How could you say to me that I've lost my way
When you're walking away
And I'm willing to give my all...

But everytime the smallest thing goes wrong girl
You're out the door
You don't wanna deal with this pain anymore
Why can't you understand that somethings

You screaming its over between us but I don't believe ya
You such a diva, a drama queen
Girl why you blowing up like a Osama's been
What you want a argument well I ain't speaking
We come to far now and I ain't leaving
If we gotta problem let's get on top of it
We ain't gotta split we can conquer it
But we gotta quit over reacting
Imagine just last night we're romancing
First passion now we be clashing
I know what's happening you throw in a tantrum
As a man I'm making the first move
You know I never do nothing to blatantly hurt you
We got a situation to work through
But patients a virtue and baby it take two so

I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out

Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out

It feel like fire (fire) Shut up in your bones
What's this devilish shit you on?
(It's like the body of a vampire, you nocturnal, you don't tire)
Only move around in the dark
The light burns your skin you have no heart
(They call me Mr. Sinister, arch angel, Lucifer)
I'm a son to the anarchy
I'll show you the way if you follow me
(And I come in many shapes, the message I spread to you, is hate!)

And don't worry 'bout the police
(That's just one less nigga on the streets)
And now this block is yours
(His girl is yours!) The world is yours!
(I'm just a voice in ya head)
A figment of your imagination instead
(And I spoke to the best of them, got a long list
And I ain't get to the rest of them)
(And not yet, how much you wanna bet,
I make you go postal shootout your projects)
(Or you whole school, you a young fool, 
And don't nobody love you like I do)

And take the stress off your chest
Just sell me your soul and we go
To the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
I make you rich (Celebrity overnight)
Fuck bitches (Sell drugs) Live your life
(Don't need to worry 'bout nothin'!)
Keep on gunnin', keep on hustlin'

One man can’t put the price pon humanity

Everybody knows Johnny came from the roughest part of town 
Survived the School of Hard Knox but still came up and made his chips 
The realest life, never watch it down 
Walk with a gun through the heart of town

To the youth down in the gully where Johnny boy done grow

Turn from crying man poverty

Come into slavery, we would be emancipated

I knew instantly 
That you'd be the one for me 
Deep down in my heart baby, oh yeah 
? 
Sat by me real casually 
Asked you if you'd like a drink 
Instead you offered one to me

You're good for my heart, my mind, my soul 
You make me whole

But I love you more each day 
And I doubt it ever gon' change, no 
If you ever left me, nothing would remain 
You're part of me, no you're all of me

And I beg you please spend your life with me, yeah

There's always some shine when you're around 
It's like my feet don't even touch the ground, ooh

On one knee I will go down, grab your hand 
And tell you now 

You will always be all I will ever need

Will you marry me?

But first I gotta make my rise
Baby, slow down
My crib's on the other side of town
But from the look in her eyes
She was hypnotized
Rubbed her hands on my chest
And started getting undressed
Tell me why

Could it be my chromed-out rims?
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feelin' me
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked
Tell me why you just can't stop
I'm thinking that it's all about me
What could it be?

I got the sixty-inch flat TV, what?
Got it like DVD, whatever you need
I got the bubbles in the tub with the back rub (bathtub)
Silk sheets, baby, to make love
Oh girl, I wanna hit it in the worst way
After that, you'll be coming back like every day
Oh yeah, send you back to your girls with something else to say
How I hit it, split it, had you with it till the break of day

Could it be my chromed-out rims?
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip
Or could it be the ice you see?

Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked
Tell me why you just can't stop
I'm thinking that it's all about me
What could it be?

Could it be the drop-top Benz?
That got your friends going out on a limb
Sliding me numbers when you ain't watching them
Playing me close but I'm not feeling them
Could it be the timepiece flooded with chips?
You with me 'cause I flex Bridgets around my wrist?
Or large amounts up in my bank account?
You tell me you love me baby, but what's that all about?

Could it be my chromed-out rims?
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feelin' me

Yeah.. wife in law, my bitch for the triflin whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car

C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law

However you want it I can handle that

Ass was so tight..

Before I let you go

Chickens cluckin' everywhere I didn't care

Instead of makin' love to you lady
I would rather be out pushin' my Mercedes

It seems he tapes his eyes closed,
From huffin' on, that's what he's puffin on.
His style is rough, he wears his hair in cornrows,
His jeans hang loose and low
So his di, opps he can't be comfortable I mean, he's gotta be comfortable.

Now she's the type that's compared to a rose that grew from the concrete,
So sweet ya know,
From the streets yo.
Now she's the opposite of he,
Have you ever seen a lion sleep on the bosom of a sheep?
It's beautiful.
Yeah thug though.

[Chorus]
She's so beautiful and he's a thug,
They're so different yet they're in love.
He's so thugged out and she's so beautiful,
They're so perfect cause they're in love.

Picture this, his warm velvet voice on a cold winters night,
Sugar free, bitter truth.
Building life from a slang so divine.
Soul to soul, their flesh pressed,
From a firm of onyx tenderness.
He signed his name with a venom kiss,
Upon a heart, I never heard of such bliss.

Now she's the opposite of he,
Such as a butterfly and he's a killer bee.
Yeah, she becomes a victim to his sting,
And he's amazed by the colors of her wings.
And the life he's led has left him with some scars,
But, she viewed them all as mid-beauty marks.
The moral of the story, plain as can be,
He loved her cause, He is me.

Da Da-da-da da da da-da-da da

Made for each other 'cause they're in love.

From a different type of story since they were born.

So take my hand and lets take a bow,

Just for being my friend, being my wife,
I'd do it all again

Won't you trust me, I will show you,
The type of man Iwas raised to be if you just let me,
Slide this ring up, up on your finger, (on your finger girl)

Promise to never let you down, oh no,
I promise to always be right there, I'll be around

You been looking real good lately
Makin' me feen I know we're friends but listen up
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans
Makin' me weak I think you really trust me too much

You and me been cool
Since back in middle school
Like when we used to clown
And run around
And act a fool

Now that were older I been noticing you bustin out those jeans
Never seen that coming up think you know what I mean
When other niggaz tried to holla had to let em know
Told em none of ya'll ain't good enough the truth be told

'Cause when I first figure out what love was
I was a young blood
And you've always been that treasure
We've always been together

Your not that little girl I once knew anymore
I will see you fitting your clothes so well I can tell
Your not that girl from junior high school that's for sure
Your changing the rules now that your fine as hell

[Chorus]

Now there you go again on my lap
Thinking that I'm in control and I won't react
When your form is grown so phat
Bout time you know for all that its worth

Your killing me softly in those product tops and mini skirts
Hots just puttin' work all up in my face girl what did you think
That I'd stop being a man when you came on the block
Showin' your promises

On the back of that bike
Showin' just what I like
And a woman if you get it you had it comin' girl

Believe me when I tell ya
You don't want the drama

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
A yo, for years I been buyin' my coke from the same cat
Dominican nigga who look black (that's right)
This summer I heard that (ha!)
I see me always swerve wit a (give it up!) where the bird at (yeah)
Apocalyptic, I pop biscuits (apocalypse), my bitch is topless
Not too excited I skeet skeet my own boxes
Drama King got the drama goods (bluh, bluh, bluh!)
Same place as the Domin' Osama Hood
Shoot up the thug and still puttin' the dame on it
The pimps had to give me a cup wit my name on it
I was ""Gordito""
I'm still Gordo or ""Gito""
Still know how to get the raw dough for cheap-o (cheap)
I'm lastin' all palm wit the connect of a ""perico"" (parakeet)
N.O.R.E. got no manners (no manners!)
I take a picture of ya ""culo"" wit the phone cameras
Go into ya own banners (ha!), they say my ballin' so hot like lone candles
And port or part of Santiago wit my own hammers (oh!)

[Chorus: Jaheim, Left Gunz]
[Left Gunz] Believe me when I say (oh!)
[Jaheim] You don't want no drama
[Left Gunz] It's ghetto die hood, thugged out all day (what?!)
[Jaheim] You don't want no problems (oh ohh!)
[Left Gunz] Shit is real killer, you could ask KaySlay
[Jaheim] Believe me when I tell ya!
[Left Gunz] We drama kings nigga we don't play
[Jaheim] You don't want the drama

[Verse 2: Nature]
Nature, alright, the year 2000 and 4 the War Report (port)
Niggaz make it out the hood, it's a small reward (ward)
We all fucked up and mauled cause that's all we saw (alright)
Tryin' to rob from the the rich and let the poor get poor (poor)
Or rob the poor cause niggaz be the hungriest (my niggaz)
I'm on the Internet - catch me on your Buddy List (I'll be in trouble, ha!)
Catch me where the money is, megas and millions (megas)
And the barrel got the kick of 11 guerillas (shout!)
Seen niggaz get hit and lose a whole lot of blood (what?)
When a nigga legit, a nigga knowin' how to stunt (stunt)
Uptown, Downtown, go wherever he at (wherever he at)
Nigga make it implication, shit better be fat (shit better)
Nigga small talk, it's all talk - let it be that (let it be that)
I get pussy from my friends (pussy!) give my enemies clap (ha ha!)
You don't want me on ya block (you don't want me) niggaz better be strapped
So relax nigga

[Chorus: Jaheim, Left Gunz]
[Verse 3: Left Gunz]
My name ring from the Clippers to the Nets (yeah)
You could look and see I'm Dirty Jerz down to the zippers on my sweats (oh)
Far from the type of cat that pay a bitch's rent
I got a +Fox+ like +Vivica+ and never gave her +50 Cent+ (ha ha!)
And I bet you ain't ready for war yet (uh)
My niggaz got stripes, who walk around like the Barbershop Quartet? (ooh!)
It's no way to harm this nigga
I don't need no bitch to pump eye until my arms get bigger
Still a problem in this the rap game, problem in the street
Yo Slay, they havin' problems, we can solve em wit the heat
I show em what the drama is
That's when ya whole shit splattered all across the front porch in momma crib
And wit a couple hot slugs get behind ya ribs (ooh!)
You really mean it when ya screamin' , ""I'm just tryin' to live!""
The game is over now
why'all niggaz slept long enough, time to come up out that coma now, uh

[Chorus: Jaheim, Left Gunz]
[Verse 4: Jaheim]
Yo, straight off the bat
You don't want the drama nigga Left Gunz gon' clap
When I'm comin' try to run and catch one in ya back
Ooh! You don't really want the problems

And nothin' to gain but pimpin' the game",No Problems,2004

I can't eat I can't sleep
My knees weak makin' me keep shakin'
I need a real nigga to come save me
One who pamper me and bathe me
And make me wanna swallow his baby
Talkin' thug shit like fuck me crazy
From the back or in the butt
I'm like fuck me baby fuck me baby

All the matter is
I can get you wet again
Suck you fuck you better than
Any other nigga can

Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without Viagra
I'll fuck you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to breakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leaving and I'll be ab libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made each other cum
We'll be suckin' and fuck each other
Taste each other cum
No soul alive can erase what we done
All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanently

Puffing a spliff, post up on the block
Like the baddest chick
So I asked her one question like
Wait a minute, who you wit?
I'm in a fayest whip, rims spinning and shit
I pulled over on the curb, had to represent
Hey girl, it's not safe out here walking alone
Hop your pretty a** in, I'll take you home

I'm not your average guy, girl I'm far from a lame

Couldn't keep that on the low
The girl was straight blazing from head to toe

Girl lets see some ID, no you won't get me
As a fact on that, I'm about to fall back
I can easily replace you
I'm not trying to get locked up

Put TV screens in the headrest door

Preparing for the future
Put the down on something

Holding the dice tryna get a little more
Or something more secure
In the house cuddled up on the couch
With the woman adore

Or creeping with my ex trying not to get caught
Or wifing you
Ready yo die for you
Oh yea that's all I wanna do

Out of all the things that I been through
I'd rather be kicking it with my boo
When the pillows not enough
And there's no one to cuff

Can't no other chick compare to her
She can pull it off rocking Timbs and a fur
She my class ghetto girl

Jaheim,"Who
Who did the daddy thing
When a father wasn't there
Who did the daddy thing

Now usually
If there's a car seat
Up in the back seat
Or a tiny shoe swinging from the rear view mirror
A ring on her hand
I could never be her man
But we got so close
Blew all my dough in the Baby Gap school clothes
Pretty little angel in berets and bows
And a button nose
After a while started calling me daddy

I should've known that it couldn't last
Should've known that you'd take him right back
I should've took off running
When I first saw her coming
Would have never gotten so attached

When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit with a bid upstate
When she needed diapers, wipes, food, and baby shoes
Won't you tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody nobody but me

Now normally
I would just hit and run
But can't you see
I'm about you and your little one
I took the jokes from all of my folks
How I got caught up playing step daddy
I got my income tax
And said fuck it
And traded in your bucket
Cause that coupe wasn't big enough
I wasn't trying to replace him
Now that he's back around
Guess you don't need me now
You don't need me anymore

I should've known that it could'nt last
Should've known that you'd take him right back
I should've took off running
When I first saw her coming
Would have never gotten so attached

When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit with a bid upstate
When she needed diapers,wipes,food,and baby shoes
Won't you tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody but me

On her first day of school
Holidays from the very first steps she made
When she needed love, trust, patience and truth
I want you to tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody but me

Longs walks with
Piggy backs and
Baby cribs and light blue Timbs
I did it all out of love(all in the name of love)
Every Christmas
Xbox's little dresses
Tennis braclets
I did all
All just because
When there was no one(no one)
When nobody else was there for her

When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit with a bid upstate
When she needed diapers, wipes, food, and baby shoes
Won't you tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
And you know I was the man
Who did the daddy thing?
A shoulder to cry on
Someone to talk to
On her first day of school
Holidays from the very first steps she made
When she needed love, trust, patience, and truth
I won't you to tell me

Jaheim,"Oh Ah ha!

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my â??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

The seal of Sin
Upon your chest, protect you

In the sky the morning star soars
Way up high remind us all
The years to come all love will die

Before the sun, a star sends its light
Set your ritual, right
Streams of torment
Streams of blood
Fear for your doul, your spirit

Remember me gaze at the sun
Light your fire let them remember
Forgetful they are
Still they are gods

All of them old and new
Let them all gather

Damn I'm in love
Hit it from the house to the club
Keep my mind on her 
Spend my last dime on her
She bring me to cloud nine when my ass climb on her
Can see she make the picture clear
Just like Time Warner
Treat her like the car
The way that I ride on her
She helped me focus in 
Get my rhymes right too
And my mind right too
That's why she shine through

I gotta quit
I gotta get this chick up out my system
She's no good for me
All of my dogs wanna hit her
Right after I'm with her
I eat then I fall asleep
And it's gettin' costly 
Lately all I've been banging is the chicks that come to see
But shorty she's a dime
In fact that girl's a dub
And I think I'm falling in love
She gets me all chocked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself
You see she's gives me stimulation
And nobody's messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big
And you better believe 
Nobody's blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
Just call me a fiend
I'm just a addict for your love, I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go
I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I twist her up, pull her to me real slow (so slow)
Let the taste of a chocolate make my eyes get low
But she burns through my paper so fast
Gotta make it last
Hate to watch them Swisha sweets walk past
When my personal stash get low
Then it's back to the block tryna find her
Surely she's a dime
In fact that girls a dub

I'm a fiend for her
Go to sleep wit a dream of her
Wake up, grind hard, get cream for her
Play the whip on a lean wit her
Just in case I don't make it home
I'ma leave a team with her
Me and her been down since her head was round
I went to every party in town and bought her a round
And now she get lose with it 
Her heads purple and green but she looks cute with it
And I ain't mad at her
I let the team take a stab at her
I bring her home all alone and then pack her bags for her
We can do it all night, right?
Wake up and do it all day 
All we needs a light bright

Letting her go
Is gunna be a slow process
One kiss from her lips took the stress up off my chest
Riding shot gun, body tight, couldn't hold it in
Had to park and spark it up again
And I swear she left her heaven scent in the air
All in my clothes, all in my hair

12 O'clock still phishing
I done broke up bricks with baking soda in the kitchen
I done lost my religion
Done spent my tuition
I couldn't fill up the hole in my soul,
There's something missing
I done sat back and laughed and
Let the beats unfold
Done scores of triggers
Robbed niggas and stores
Five years parole
Kid I've been locked up
I done lost so much my heart is boxed up

I thought I'd never see the blue sky
Never see the birds fly
Until I met you sunshine
I never knew the other side
Never knew what love was like
I thought I'd never see a pot of gold
But baby you're the rainbow
Take me where I never been
I thought the pain would never end
But now, now that I've found my girl
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no
And now, now she's inside of my world
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no

I done drowned my sorrows in a bottle of gin
I done poured out liquor for my very best friend
I been rich, fell off and got dough again
Been left out in the cold, told I could never win
I done promised to my lady I would try to change
Met a chick went back in to the same damn thing
I done took the blame and blamed people for things
Snatching change on the train, I've done some things

I thought I'd never see the blue sky
Never see the birds fly

Every day seemed gray
Until you came and you brought the sun my way
Til Heaven or earth sent her my way I longed for the day
Somebody would say, ""I love you baby"" and
If it weren't for you there ain't no person I'd be trusting
In the sound of my voice
Oh for better or worse, richer or poor
I've been through so much
Til you'll be my girl forever, now

Bouncing up my block, I saw you twice

I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean?

I'm just an addict for your love
I've got to have it, all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I'm a fiend for her, go to sleep wit a dream of her
Wake up, grind hard, get cream for her
Play the whip on a lean wit her
Just in case I don't make it home
I'ma leave a team with her

Me and her been down since her head was 'round
I went to every party in town and bought her around
And now she get lose with it
Her head's purple and green but she looks cute with it

And I ain't mad at her, I let the team take a stab at her
I bring her home all alone and unpack her bags for her
We can do it all night, right, wake up and do it all day
All we need's a light, right

Letting her go is gonna be a slow process
One kiss from her lips took the stress up off my chest
Riding shot gun, body tight, couldn't hold it in
Had to park and spark it up again

And I swear she left her heaven scent in the air
All in my clothes, all in my hair
She got my head in a cloud
Y'all know what I'm talking about

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean

I'm just an addict for your love
I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine

(Well)
It's crazy, how you play mev
(Oh, yea)
How you play me, how you play me
Why, why'd you do it, baby?

When I was hittin'
I was in rotation off the charts
Like number two with a bullet
I was shooting straight for your heart

But it looks like I'm slippin'
From that peak position
Drop down on your list, from top ten
To not even being on your countdown

And so I wait
For you to come digging in the crates
Blow off the dust
So I could finally get some attention

'Cause once you put the n**** on wax
You can't just put me back
Just cut it up and scratch it and get back
'Cause you're only gonna play me again

You fade me out
And you blend him in

But I can't help but be jealous
The way your work them other dudes

You get caught up skipping

I'll show you the remix, baby

[Verse 1]
Good man, good woman
Hooked up and they had a couple of children
Four kids, look what the lord did
Smilin' on my parents with a blessing

And even though their days wouldn't be long
Momma looked around and daddy's gone
But we weren't alone
Until the lord called her home

She's in a place with my little sister
From time to time man I really miss her
And as for my dad, from what I understand
He was a strong man
And I know they're back together

[Chorus]
Poppa went first, and momma went last
But I ain't mad, cause I know that
They're back together again, up in heaven
When the sun shines down
There's a smile on my face
There ain't no doubt when I think about
Where they went
And they're back together, together again

[Verse 2]
I wish I could tell em
All of the things I never got to tell him
But I'm sure he knows
Made sure my mama told him so
And even when I start stressin'
I think of what a good time they're havin'

And the bottom line is
Man I know this

She's gone upstairs with my little sister
And I can clearly see the picture
Julie and my dad
How can I be mad
When the lord has brought them together

[Chorus]
See poppa went first, and momma went last
And I ain't mad, cause I know that
They're back together again, up in heaven
As the sun shines down
There's a smile on my face
There's no doubt, there's no doubt when I think about
Where they went
Cause they're back together again

[Bridge]
Even though that my parents just wasn't in the plans
See, when I was a young man I didn't understand
Now I'm all grown up, and I'm missing your touch
The portrait in the frame, it's just not enough
All the dreams I've been chasin' after everyday
The memories just won't seem to fade away
There's only one thing, I'll tell you something
I know that they're dancing up in heaven through the lord's grace

[Chorus]
Cause poppa went first, and momma went last
And I said I ain't mad cause I know where they went
Up in heaven, upon high
When the sun shines down, and the rain starts to pour

You're dancing in the sky
Said I wrote this song about it, and I'm real real proud about it
I know you're dancing in the sky

Come on

Have you ever
Think about it

Have you ever
Thought of what you did
When you were a kid
As you reminisce

Have you ever
Thought about your life
Thought you paid a price
Cuz It wasn't right
Have you ever

Ever tell the truth but lied
Held back when you shoulda cried
Didn't say it when you shoulda said goodbye
Meant something but didn't say
Said something but didn't mean
Seems like we all been through it

Ever let the people get away
Ever look back
And wish you could get back
How it was back in the day
Ever had a girl
You wouldn't budge
Instead of telling them how much
You'd be true with loving

Have you ever ever
Or am I the only one
Tell me have you ever
Looked back on the things that you've done

Been up in the club
Bustin' over
One too many
Double shots of henney
Told you she was twenty-one
You think maybe
You and her leaving
End up in a hotel suite bed
Whoa! no glove
Slipped up now you gettin that love
Next morning you wake up
Feeling stupid..
I have

Have you ever been
Caught up in a jam
You and your man
Not thinking
Make a quick decision
Got the Ooh Wee In your hand
Busted you be doing 20 plus fo' sure
Drop it and run then the whole hood'll know

Whoa, time passed
Given that behind the three
Hit's glass
Raise my sons the only thing he asked

Coming up I had it bad
I never knew my dad
Only memories, a picture in a frame
He passed away when I was two
There was nothing they could do
And all I know is that they said he was the ladies man
Momma kept pressing on
Her boys kept her strong
We didn't need for much
She did it all alone
She kept her head up high
Till the day she died
Told me to never give up
Do what I gotta, to survive

I been uptown, played many games, hurt by many girls
Been all around, looking for love, but no one to trust
I been locked down with the big boys
See I changed now
The high school diploma made my momma proud

In and out of jail since 12
A juvenile so no bail
Most of my summer days, spent em' away
They gave me a B and E, first degree robbery, criminal mischief
Prosecution's on my heels now
I tried to straighting up too
I got hit by deja vu
A 9 to 5 couldn't find it
My only option was to block it
I been shot at, stabbed
You don't know the half
I was a real ass cat
Taking a look back
The life of a thug

I been uptown, played many games, hurt by many girls
Been all around, looking for love, but no one to trust
I been locked down with the big boys
See I changed now
The high school diploma made my momma proud

I been through so much
Didn't know who to trust
I could only count on me
Out in playing in these streets
Had to change up my hustle
Had to live with the struggle
Taking a dozen a blow
It's been a long time coming but I came up
And I gotta thank the Lord
Cause he gave me enough
Anything more than that I wouldn't be where I'm at
Anything less I confess
Look at me now
I'm at my best

But you hide it so well
You tug on his sleeve
You beg and you plead
Anything so that he won't leave
He would be like oh well (oh well)
And half of the time you knew he was lying
Said he was on his rizzily grind
He's providing so well

During love makin' we lose control of ourselves
Digging in my back with your nails
But you do it so well
And we both fall asleep then your Sidekick beeps
Angry messages he left on your cell
You know he's gonna yell... oh well
Do you think he suspects us
Picked up on the trail
Thinks it's time you sit him down and tell
Cause he knows you so well

For all the lies that you coulda been honest

Jaheim,"[Chorus]
She don't make me feel like you
She don't hold me down like you
On the real she ain't you, you, you, you, you, you, you
She can't wear the crown like you
She can't put it down like you
On the real she ain't you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
I like her, but I love you
She's fly, but she can't fly over you
Your love is like a brand new Bentley Coupe
Her love is like a Benz that's been used
And you just can't compare the two
The road to happiness leads back to you
Now since we been apart I done tried a few
Nobody's coming close to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
These other girls just can't fill your shoes
They can't walk in your Gucci boots
If I let you move on to someone new
I would feel like such a fool
That would be crazy, cause baby you're a winner
And every time I'm with her I be thinking 'bout you boo...
And how she don't compare to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So listen up Shorty
Girl be down for me
Oh Baby, my baby
I was just passing time
Trying to get you off of my mind
Baby
Now how can I prove myself
I really don't need nobody else
You're the one that I love
My angel from up above
First time I laid my eyes on you I knew you were the one
... and baby girl you're second to none
She's aight, but she's not my type
Girl it's true I wanna give you my life
And I hope one day you let me make you my wife baby
Oh, Oh, oooh baby",She Ain't You,2007

Now guess who's back
That nigga with them platinum plaques
How you gon' deal with that
Tell me how you niggas wanna act
New deal, few mil, nigga check my stats
And I'm still on the block
Hustlin' just don't stop
How you think I iced the watch
And I still got whips to cop
Clowns gon' mess around
Have to lay em' down

Still gutta like a mother
Don't make me black
You don't want none of that
I represent this r&b... ya'll know this
How can you compete... I'm focused
And I'm thinking you should pack it up
Cause Jah got what they want (believe me)

What the game really need
Is the true voice of r&b
So I gave ya'll the chance to lead
Now that I'm back relax and breathe

I been sittin' back in the cut patiently waiting
Watching you close, learning from your mistakes and
They gased you up, now you sitting on E
I'm the new voice of r&b
I'm sick of this
And I just can't get with it
Hope you stacked up your chips
Now won't you sit back and breathe

Jaheim,"[Verse 1]
She was just an ex of a nigga
Who kept her from her fullest potential
Always played games with her mental
And every type of shit to make her self esteem little
But now her days are always so fly
She's a diamond on the rough no lie
I'm rough enough to make the diamond shine
Just like a trophy ima hold her high
And now I know, oh I know

[Chorus]
And she's good to me, great to me
She crowned me to be the King
Now what you think of that?
Cause she's down for me, my homie, my tangeroni only
Now what you think of that?
Cause she stay real with me, deal with me, perfect to be my wife
Now what you think of that?
She's beautiful to me and I don?t care what you think of that
Now, what you think of that?

[Verse 2]
Hey
She always keep it at a hundred
Never caught fake, phony, or frontin'
Always show me love when I want it
And never lose her cool over nothing
I admit she a gift no lie
The type of girl that you?d be dumb to pass by
She's a blessin' when she came in my life
And I'm so happy that she's mine, oh mine
I know, Oh I know!

This is dedicated to the woman
That's makin' it
Through the struggling and taking it inside
I know that it's hard cause I seen the pain
Through the tears on my momma's eyes
Tryin' your best to be strong
When your past did you wrong
I got your back girl things will be fine
And I gotta give you credit, don?t sweat it
Its gonna get better, forever you?ll have my love

Jaheim,"Yeah, oh, no

I used to be the kind of brother
They thought I would never slow down
I used to swear that I don't even care
What happens but baby right now

I see that, you changed my mind
I mean that and it took some time
But now I understand
I can be a better man

I never had a chance to meet
A lover quite like you
You revealed another part of me
Girl you love is trivin' true

Never, will I break your heart
Never, will we ever part
Never, can't believe I used to say it
I used to say

Never, will I love this way
Never, gave my heart away
Never would this player hang
His jersey up and leave the game

Never would've thought
In a million years
I would be here
That's why I say

Never, would I know the truth
Never, would I know
That you would come into my life
And make everything new oh

Never would've thought I would
Take your hand, girl I swear
I would never, never, never, never
Never say never again, again, again

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

There ain't no question that I love you
I know we've had our ups and downs
But through the tears I know there is nowhere
I can say I'd rather be now

I see that, your my shining star
I mean that, girl you got my heart
And now I hold you here
'cause you made me a stronger man

I wish that I could place
The whole world in front of you
But a man is just a man
So baby, here's my vow to you, babe

Never, will I break your heart
Never, will we ever part
Never, can't believe I used to say it
I used to say

Never, will I love this way
Never, gave my heart away
Never, would this player hang
His jersey up and leave the game

Never would've thought
In a million years
I would be here
And that's why I say

Never, had I known the truth
Never, when I know
That you would come into my life
And make everything new, oh

Never would've thought
I would take your hand, girl I swear
I would never, never, never
Never, never say never

From the day you came along
I sung a brand new song
'cause I know you made it clear to see
That you're a special part of me

Before I had no clue, I was lost till I found you
Baby and I wanna make your heart understand
I'm proud to be your man and I'm 'bout to stay forever
I can't believe that I use to say

Never, will I love this way
Gave my heart away
Never would this player hang
His jersey up and leave the game

Never, no, no, never
No, no, no, no, no

I never would've thought
I would take your hand
I would never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never say never again

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my â??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)
