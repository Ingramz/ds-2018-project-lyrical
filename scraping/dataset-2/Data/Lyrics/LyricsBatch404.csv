James Blake,"The rainiest days

Digital lion
Digital lion

I will see you probably
And even if you ask right
My heart feels like love
Whispering this in his days
For all feels like mine
Whispering this in his days

James Blake,"She knows a good thing now
With our own cost and all can hear the word
In my hair and in my thoughts
In my hair and in my thoughts

We spend the whole days all
We're feeling more apart
And we know you can do more

Please, don't let me hurt you more
It's in your stare and at your core
Please, don't let me hurt you more
Please, don't let me hurt you more

I know this journey's soon
The color of lights and our lives become as you

Please, don't let me hurt you more
It's in your stare and at your core",DLM,2013
James Blake,"Link my door tonight, I am sold
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
You said it was a flash of green
But you hadn't known

And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel

And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal

But I am going to shoot
There's nothing like a break
But it may be a consolation
That shows us where we are

And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal

So most of how you felt
I'm glad I could help
I could talk this over twenty times again
Everything you've learned from a past island
So most of how you felt
I'm glad I could help

But I am going to shoot
There's nothing like a break
But it may be a consolation
That shows us where we are

And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal

And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal

James Blake,"You know how we've grown
And how they catch our every turn

Everyone's arrived here
I see the pictures of everyone
And they truly got it

But it's your image burned into my mind
And again I find
That it's worth the climb
And I love
That it's right on time

Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night",Our Love Comes Back,2013
James Blake,"I don't want you to know
I took it with me
But when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is

I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown

But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play along

And I don't want you to know

James Blake,"You can't marry her you can't marry her yet
Son, you'll drown me twice

The seven EOE be the breath of life inside a human being
Joined though this love, nothing could come between
Blood is thicker than mud, liquor the elixir of love
Turn a square dance into a passion hug
Tight as the grip of the squid
Gentle as the finger touch of a newborn kid
I wouldn't trade her smile for a million quid
Don't let my love fall, keep building it
I heard through the grape vine that great love, it takes time
Sex shapes the body, truth shapes the mind
Candlelight dinners and fish and chips with vinegar
With a glass of cold stout or wine or something similar
Salam in this, channeled through the Italian peninsula
Her strong pheromones and cologne enhance the stench of her
But she aksed for romance, spent this love, enter her
Don't let me fall, always remember us
Don't roll the dice, don't let them throw the rice
Don't throw my soul over to the poltergeist
His heart was cold like it was soaked in ice
A stroke of your love is like a stroke of life
Melt in the heat of my passion magnetic attraction
It cause a strong reaction
I need you like I need satisfaction
I need you like I need satisfaction

What will become of me?
If I can't show my love to thee?
What will become of me?
What will become of me?
If I can't show my love to thee? (You can't marry her)
What will become of me?

I heard through the grape vine that great love, it takes time

Candlelight dinner, fish and chips with the vinegar

But she aksed for romance, I'm deep into her
Don't let her fall, always remember us
Don' marry him
No, no, no, no, no don't marry him
Don' marry him, don't carry him to paradise
Don't throw let them dice, don't let them throw the rice
Don't turn my soul deep into the poltergeist
His heart turns cold like it was soaked in ice
Melt inside the heat of my passion magnetic attraction
It cause a strong reaction
I need you like I need satisfaction
I need you like I need satisfaction

Don't turn away from me

You and I

It's a sweet world
Always
It's a sweet world
It's so easy
And I'm not afraid
And I have no hurt

Grounds to an old war

May I have her hand?
I won't protect myself
If I find her clothes, I'll keep her
Always

It's so easy
Not disappearing
I'm no guardian
But if we're here again
I'll be on your side
I'll lose the glass

Always

It's a sweet world
But who's housing it?
I can unstick these things
And I'll be glad to see them leave forever

James Blake,"On your island, there's no weather warning
There's no sudden showers
There's no certain powers, no
All I wanted was to carry you for aching

And how I told you what I'd do
If one day I woke and couldn't find the colour in anything

All I thought I was worth
Was to mend things, are so breaking
And how I chased the glory
How I wanted to carry you for aching

And how I told you what I'd do
If one day I woke and couldn't find the colour in anything

You must not be trying like I'm trying
I can't always help you
But I can listen for the sounds you're making
And how I loved your story
How I wanted to follow you and paint it

And how I told you what I'd do

James Blake,"Don't use the word ""forever""
We live too long to be so loved
People change and I can be tethered
We think we are the only ones
You can't walk the streets a ghost anymore

Days form like new figures down my road
Each one looks more like you than you know
Beauty always in the lust
You always landed on your feet in the dust

While you were away, there was nothing to see
There's a mirror in my room I never used
While you were away, I started loving you
Oh, loving you

And I noticed I can still ghost the streets
I noticed I can still ghost the streets
I noticed just how slow the killer bee's wings be
And how wonderful, how wonderful
How wonderful you are",F.o.r.e.v.e.r.,2016

Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in a violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn on the bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

Before I started to think
Worry about things beyond my control
Fear things I didn't understand

A creek down below
Seldous trees all under the rand
Scratch the roof
When the night winds blow

When we were four feet tall

Refrigerators run on kerosene
Making ice from fire

Raising a dust cloud
Weaving through wattle
In the end only God could slow her down

When we were four feet tall

Rugging horses to keep them warm

Living the life I was born to
One day the Lord got bored
And wiped it away with the sweep of his hand
Finding my feet in a land without season
Searching for a reason
Trying to understand

We all know that you're the one. Singing,
So long, Jimmy, so long.
Sure we're glad for the experience,
We miss you now you've gone.
We're just swimming in your soul 'cause,
We all wish we wrote this song.
Life goes on.

I'm just so relieved that it's over.
We were hanging out going nowhere,
Digging how the guitar goes,
In a song that no one knows.
Did you burn that bridge yourself,
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Are you just cool and I'm just baked?
Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?

Shed the clothes that become my skin,
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same, it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind,
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

And another day god will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down,down,down

As strong as you were
Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means

I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

And they all want pretty
New York City lights
And summers little girl has been taken from the world tonight
But the stars and stripes

As strong as you were
Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And i'll carry you home

As strong as you were
Tender you got

Fall apart in your hands

Then should I just, follow you into the dark
Yeah, and does your silence keep you cool

Fall apart in your hands
And my good intentions never end,

It seems you only want the things that you can't have.

Close up your heart and hide your dancing shoes away
And cut yourself with your mistakes
Leave all hope lying in a line of chalk
Everything you need is disguised in double talk
So wound yourself and let it ache

I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high
I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high

It's all little pieces till there's nothing left
All just debris of your former self
Just take a breath for your own sake
And if you're watching for something to bring you round

I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high
I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name

Did no one see, you fall behind

Turn the radio on
And you'll hear this simple song
That I made up
That I made up for you

When you're driving
Turn the radio up
Cause I can't sing loud enough
Hard these days
To get my message through

If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you

Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

When you marry
And you look around
I'll be somewhere in that crowd
Torn up, that it isn't me

When you're older
And the memories fade
But I know I'll still feel the same
For as long as I live

But if time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you

Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

Won't you say my name, one time
Please just say my name

And I don't know what goes on in your mind
I'm sure it's enough to make my cry.
Someday we'll find you lived forever.

But no goodbyes
You'll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly,
But nothing's free Miss America.
And as you fall apart
We just call it art.

And just to show you

I'll be the first to say I'm sorry,
The first to say I'm stupid

Is it hopeless or maybe you still want to
Meet me at the altar?

All my fears, I've let go.
And it's flawless,
You are the only one,
You are the only one,

With stories I exaggerate
That you know aren't true

And as you sit there making daisy chains
And I throw in a hand granate
And tell you how it is I really feel for you

On a bicycle that your daddy made
But not made for two

You with a flower in your hair
That I found for you

She's from a long lost tribe looking for the light
Or a friend to hold her hand
She's doing the best she can

Out there waiting by a phone
Wondering why they feel alone

Somebody's gonna build a wall
Then smash it with a cannon ball
Someone who somehow has got a gun
Will tell you who you can't and you can love
Some people keeping all the cash
They're gonna get away with that
Just 'cause some people don't think like me

You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'll tell you what I'm doing now

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a
Better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better

I'm not gonna lie
Saying I didn't work out
'Cause I live in a big house, made a few pounds
Nice car on the drive
And I went round the world once or twice
Saw the sun set and sun rise
But for big highs, there's a big price
When all you do is criticize

I just listen and I hold her close

They were twice our age and so much in love 
Twenty years they were celebrating 
Hand in hand they couldn't sit close enough 
I leaned over and asked that man 
What is your secret for love like that

He said there's never really been any secret 
Love is simply what you make of it 
In a world with so many choices 
Just give your heart and then stand by it 

We bought champagne and we toasted the couple 
They wished us well and then went their way 
We sat back down a little closer together 
And you told me what that woman had to say 
She said honey love won't ever be easy 
But that don't mean it can't be the best 

You see there's never really been any secret

And I woke up with a premonition 
We just best beware 

The devil goes fishin' in trouble water 
He'll come callin' if we don't bother 
To make things right and love the way it's supposed to be 
There's an angel sittin' on our right shoulder 
But she won't stay there if it gets much colder 
We better watch out or it'll get a lot hotter 
Cause the devil goes fishin' in troubled water 

There are times we cross the line and let selfishness and foolish pride 
Leave us weak and make a big ol' target out of you and me 
But sweet forgiveness can fix it all 
And add another rock to that mighty wall 
That keeps the harsh winds out and helps to calm that mean ol' ranging sea

Got educated by a rich man's daughter 
I didn't have to read a single book

They don't teach science they don't teach math 
Our love is history is your only class 
You do your homework every lonely night 
Study memories till the morning light 
Forget about her is the golden rule 
That's what they teach you in heartbreak school 

You don't get recess you don't get lunch 
You don't get vacation when summer time comes 
You don't get in cause they think your smart 
You pay tuition with a broken heart

I learned to cry and I learned to moan 
I learned I hate to spend my nights alone 
I studied hard on how do I forget you (then I) 
Wrote a speech on wish I'd never met you 
I got accepted to who needs you

You don't get recess you don't get lunch 
You don't get vacation when summer time comes 
You don't get in cause they think your smart

Get extra credit if your baby cheated

James Bonamy,"A Mama watched her baby
Fall and bump his head
Taking baby steps across the floor

She could have tried to catch him
But a voice inside her said
In the long run, that'll only hurt him more

And she helped me and she made me feel secure

And what it takes for two hearts to endure

And I'm a kite on your string

Then he fixed her vail
Took her arm and walked her down the aisle

When the preacher turned and ask him,
""Who gives this child away?"" 
Well he said ""Me"", and did his best to smile

Now you call him every weekend and you tell him
That you love him and you're thankful as can be
That his firm hand and his soft heart were a blessing
And the reason you can give the gift to me of

So I asked him once, ""What's the story with that thing""
He said, ""That ring of gold that's on your mama's hand
Well son this is where it all began""

This is the swing that hung from the tree
Where the girl asked the boy, ""Would you play with me""
As the sun shined bright and the world spun 'round
And they grew up till it all came down
To the church where they stood and said, ""I do""
And the bells rang out and the love was true
And it grew in the hearts of the man and the woman
Who lived in the house that love built

When I met the girl who stole my heart away
I gave that old swing a brand new coat of paint
And I told the tale as we swung to and fro
And said, ""I hope this how our story goes""

This is the swing that hung from the tree
Where the girl asked the boy, ""Would you play with me""
As the sun shined bright and the world spun 'round
And they grew up till it all came down

And the bells rang out and the love was true

Who lived in the house that love built

Out in back of the house that love built

James Brown,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2007
James Brown,"[Chorus]
Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle

One heart, I'm tied to
And the other heart
Our love is true
Either way I go
I'll bring sorrow, yeah, and
One heart will be broken in two

If I had to choose
Either one of these hearts
Then the other heart
I'll surely break

And if I ever leave
I will suffer, yeah
And who's heart will
Pay for my mistake

Why do you do me like you do
You made me love you but I feel so sad
You made me need you and it's driving me so mad
I want you so bad
I love you yes I do
I love you yes, I do
I know your love it's true from the way I looked at you
You love me yes, you do
You need me, I need you
I'm ours my whole life
Since I've lay eyes on you
I guess you knew it from the start
From the day you took my heart
You are the one girl I'll always admire
I must be whenever you are
But I want to let you know one thing
I want to tell you one thing
I want to tell you one thing
I was walking down the streets
Why just everything happen to me
why just everything  happen to me
Please, I'm lonely, I'm by myself now and the love's a memory
And so many strange things happen to me, all day long
Strange, strange things happen to me, all day long
Please I'm lonely, everything I do is wrong

Bewildered
Love, I dream of you
Well, I love, I need you
Why did we part?
Baby, take my hand (Please don't go)

Sat with me and he cried
He told me a story
I know he ain't lying

Said he went for a job
And Mr. Man said
Without an education
You might as well be dead

Now don't get me wrong
He said, it's not who you are
But people come to me
From near and far

But I do just what
And I follow the rules
I didn't have an education
So I had to go back to school

Tell me one more time, people now
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

One more time
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

My friends told all his buddies
That he loved so well
And of their personal troubles
I will not tell

Now those guys didn't seem good
And they didn't seem bad
They didn't seem so happy
And I know they weren't sad

But the point isn't
That they follow the rules
They got an education
And they all been in school

Now underneath his tears
I could see the true fact
When he dropped out of school
He never, never went back

Tell me one more time, people
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

Got to, got to, got to listen now, now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

So one day he got tired
Of his little spending change
So he looked up his friends
To check their pay range

When he got there, the crib
He found that he was a drag
'Cause man, they were clean
And his clothes were like rags

One was a business man
With the plenty of dough
He had his thing so set up
You know he couldn't blow

The other had his job so uptight
He had his whole family
And his kids all out of sight

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

What made him so hurt
That these were his friends and he was a drag
They looked at him
And he was in the same old bag

For his friends they worked real hard
When the work day was through
Now, he realized
He should have done the same thing too

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

For the last time, I'm gonna say
They kept on pushing
When the going was tough
And now they know
That things don't seem so rough

So kids, stay in school
Don't be no drag
Take a fool's advise
And stay out of that bag

Look here, tell me, Bobby tell me one more time
What do you say?
Without an education

Tell me, The Jewels, tell me now one more time
What do you say?

Everybody, tell me one more time
What do you say?

You got to, got to, got to, got to get some learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Don't be a drop-out, stay in school now listen to me
What do you say?
Kids, kids
Might as well be dead

James Brown,"Ladies and gentlemen
Fellow Americans
Lady Americans
This is James Brown

I wanna talk to you about one of our
Most deadly, killers in the country today
I had a dream the other night, and I
Was sittin' in my living room

Dozed off to sleep
So I start to dreamin'
I dreamed I walked in a place and
I saw a real strange, weird object

Standin' up talkin' to the people
And I found out it was heroin
That deadly drug that go in your veins
He says

I came to this country without a passport
Ever since then I've been hunted and sought
My little white grains are nothin' but waste
Soft and deadly and bitter to taste

I'm a world of power and all know it's true
Use me once and you'll know it, too
I can make a mere schoolboy forget his books
I can make a world-famous beauty neglect her looks

I can make a good man forsake his wife
Send a greedy man to prison for the rest of his life
I can make a man forsake his country and flag
Make a girl sell her body for a five-dollar bag

Some think my adventure's a joy and a thrill
But I'll put a gun in your hand and make you kill
In cellophane bags, I've found my way
To heads of state and children at play

I'm financed in China, ran in Japan
I'm respected in Turkey and I'm legal in Siam
I take my addicts and make 'em steal, borrow, beg
Then they search for a vein in their arm or their leg

So, be you Italian, Jewish, Black or Mex
I can make the most virile of men forget their sex
So now, no, my man, you must, you know, do your best
To keep up your habit until your arrest

Now the police have taken you from under my wing
Do you think they dare defy me, I who am king
Now, you must lie in that county jail
Where I can't get to you by visit or mail

So squirm, with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness, you might throw me off
Curse me in name, defy me in speech
But you'd pick me up right no if I were in your reach

All through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate
Hear now young man and woman, I'll be waitin' at the gate
And don't be afraid, don't run, I'm not chased
Sure my name is Heroin, you'll be back for a taste

Behold, you're hooked, your foot is in the stirrup
And make, haste, mount the steed and ride him well
For the white horse of heroin will ride you to Hell, to Hell
Will ride you to Hell until you are dead
Dead, brother, dead

This is a revolution of the mind
Get your mind together
And get away from drugs
That's the man
Back, back",King Heroin,1972
James Brown,"You know I, this is James Brown
I'm such a lover of people
Because people did so much for me
I'm a lover of all humanity, all man kind
And I feel that he who has been successful
Should look out of for his fellow man, his brother
I feel that's my role, that's my job
I know when I was a kid
You see I was gonna be a preacher, huh, ay
Maybe I am, but to me, I feel like I'm a teacher, somewhat
'Cause I've been able to experience things that most, poor
Or a lot of people haven't been able to, even the rich
So I'll start by preaching right here
'Cause I want to preach to you one more time about heroin
I talked once before, now I want to preach
I want to start by saying
I heared heroin talking one more time and said
From where I came, nobody knows
I come from a land where the poppy seed grows
A whole nation gathered to plot my destruction
Because I'm a breeder of crime and wholesale corruption
You say, I'm pure and then undiluatable
And once I'm in your blood I make it pursuitable
Now only they say sing it on son
Sing it on son, she says I've lost my son, he's gone away
Sing it on son, you might save a life
I said madam, I say lookie here
I say, on a record and make all men
That date to use it will wallow in sin
Driven then to commit a world of crime
Captive their will and destroy their mind
They changed their lives and destroyed the meek
Misurer of fools and made the strong men weak
I know, wait a minute, lookie here
They take gold from the rich and made them poor
Take young foolish maden and made her a whore
Look at that
And then I heared about that time
I heard a man over in the corner
He was sitting down with his head hanging low
I noticed him when he first walked in
And he was addicted to drugs but he said I feel it
And brother I want to get up and testify
So everybody started screaming and hollering and crying
I saw a little tear coming from my eye 'cause I know I felt it
And this brother got up and said let me have it
I want to tell you everything
Talk to a man that knows
He said some will sell me and some will buy
For a state of affection and they 'cause high
But regardless of the position, reason of use
You control my addition and I give nothing but abuse
He said let me tell you about heroin
With a full cause of torment
For it's pleasures and pain
It will take all of your money and poison your brain
Lord, I started singing, I said mmmm
The place started rocking to kinda rocking a little bit
I heard someone tapping their foot and they sing on brother
I started humming a little in the back ground
And then that brother said wait a minute
He said, beware of the sharp needle brother, it'll make you sick
Annoyed, anguished, and won't let you kick
It'll make you hustle, steal, borrow and beg
I'm still talking about that bad thing, king heroin
When you want to look for a vein in your arm or your leg
I felt so bad I didn't know what to do
He said, more priceless than diamond, more treasured than gold
More important than whiskey more deadly than wine
It'll just give you discomfort and no piece of mind
And when you come out the nod, he said you'll always be aware
You've shot every drop of your heart and it's full of fear
Now you must rush out and hit another sting
Praise me as old heroin, the king
But he said be quick my friend get off your knees","Public Enemy No. 1, Pt. 1",1972

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Look at the fix you've put me in!!

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it

I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon

James Brown,"Hard bodies, soft emotions
So fast so smart
The world's at your feet 
But what about your heart
Fame and power can't hold you tight
In the late hours of the night
 
How do you stop (How do you stop)
Before it's too late 
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop (How do you stop)
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on and then it's gone
Then it's gone
 
You've had some success  
A new group of friends
You called it the ""good life"" 
Thought it would never never end
One minute you're too young 
Then you're in your prime
Then you're lookin' back 
Through the hands of time
 
How do you (How do you stop)
Before it's too late 
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop (How do you stop)
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
You don't hold on and then it's gone
 
How do you stop a runaway train
How do you stop the pouring, pouring of rain
How do you stop the night turning to day
How do you stop love from slipping away
How do you stop from believing
How do you stop lovers from deceiving
How do you stop the tide from coming in
How do you stop the cold, cold wind
 
(How do you stop)
Before it's too late 
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop (How do you stop)

So one day he got tired
Of his little spending change
So he looked up his friends
To check their pay range

When he got there, the crib
He found that he was a drag
'Cause, man, they were clean
And his clothes were like rags

One was a business man
With plenty of dough
He had his thing so set up
You know he couldn't blow

The other had his job so uptight
He had his whole family
And his kids all out of sight

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

What made him so hurt
That these were his friends and he was a drag
They looked at him
And he was in the same old bag

For his friends they worked real hard
When the work day was through
Now he realized
He should have done the same thing too

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

For the last time I'm gonna say
They kept on pushing
When the going was tough
And now they know
That things don't seem so rough

So, kids, stay in school
Don't be no drag
Take a fool's advise
And stay out of that bag

Look here, tell me, Bobby, tell me one more time

James Brown,"This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the train to carry the heavy load
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about our little bitty baby girls and our baby boys
Man made them happy, 'cause man made them toys
And after man make everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money, to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing, without a woman or a girl

She broke down like she wanted to die 

I don't care what she does
She gon' be doin' just like she was
Take those kids and raise them up
Somebody teach 'em to be righteous tough
Take her, take that woman, it's one place she found
Just run that mother out of town

Make it get up! Make it get up, get out

James Brown,"I've been good, so good you know
Well, why do I have to suffer so
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Please, don't make me suffer so

Christmas come but once a year
Oh, won't somebody please, please
Please bring me some Christmas cheer
I need a Christmas cheer
Santa clause please, please, please don't make me suffer so
Can't take it no more

Mama's been sick, oh, Lord, papa has too
What I want please, was just to fool me and you
And my brothers too

I went to the welfare, but I waited little too long
And the little I had when I started
Couldn't know it was all gone

Lord, I've been good, oh, so good I know
Why, why, why, tell me, do I have to suffer so
Now Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Please, please don't make me suffer so

Oh Lord, do you hear me?

Mama has been sick, God help her, papa has too
I find out when I once believed, just to fool me and you
I went to the welfare but I wanted a little, a little, a little, a little help
I just can't I gotta help myself but, wait a minute

It seems, seems that I waited a little too long
When I was there, do you believe?
I found out it all got over, I ain't got nobody
But Santa Claus, you're my last hope

Please, Lord have mercy
Don't make me suffer so

When I, when I, when I realized I ain't got nobody
No, no, give me your helpin' hand
Give me your helpin' hand

Meet halfway--if you want to get it right
Meet halfway--'cause I ain't gonna take it, baby
Meet halfway--in the middle of the night

Our love is kind of stalled, baby
But it ain't about the sex
I'd trade the roses and the negligees
If we could just connect

I go deeper when you look into my eyes
There's a place where neither one of us can hide
And it's up to us to reinvent the game
Love it when you call my name and

Meet halfway--and we're halfway home
Meet halfway--got to scream and shout it, baby

Because French cream won't soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone

That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark, 
it say's you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies

And tonight you'll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through
Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you,
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run

Because people did so much for me

Should look out of for his fellow man, his brother
I feel that's my role, that's my job
I know when I was a kid
You see I was gonna be a preacher, huh, ay
Maybe I am, but to me, I feel like I'm a teacher, somewhat
'Cause I've been able to experience things that most, poor
Or a lot of people haven't been able to, even the rich
So I'll start by preaching right here
'Cause I want to preach to you one more time about heroin
I talked once before, now I want to preach
I want to start by saying
I heared heroin talking one more time and said
From where I came, nobody knows
I come from a land where the poppy seed grows
A whole nation gathered to plot my destruction
Because I'm a breeder of crime and wholesale corruption
You say, I'm pure and then undiluatable
And once I'm in your blood I make it pursuitable
Now only they say sing it on son
Sing it on son, she says I've lost my son, he's gone away
Sing it on son, you might save a life
I said madam, I say lookie here
I say, on a record and make all men
That date to use it will wallow in sin
Driven then to commit a world of crime
Captive their will and destroy their mind
They changed their lives and destroyed the meek
Misurer of fools and made the strong men weak
I know, wait a minute, lookie here
They take gold from the rich and made them poor
Take young foolish maden and made her a whore
Look at that
And then I heared about that time
I heard a man over in the corner
He was sitting down with his head hanging low
I noticed him when he first walked in
And he was addicted to drugs but he said I feel it
And brother I want to get up and testify
So everybody started screaming and hollering and crying
I saw a little tear coming from my eye 'cause I know I felt it
And this brother got up and said let me have it
I want to tell you everything
Talk to a man that knows
He said some will sell me and some will buy
For a state of affection and they 'cause high
But regardless of the position, reason of use
You control my addition and I give nothing but abuse
He said let me tell you about heroin
With a full cause of torment
For it's pleasures and pain
It will take all of your money and poison your brain
Lord, I started singing, I said mmmm
The place started rocking to kinda rocking a little bit
I heard someone tapping their foot and they sing on brother
I started humming a little in the back ground
And then that brother said wait a minute
He said, beware of the sharp needle brother, it'll make you sick
Annoyed, anguished, and won't let you kick
It'll make you hustle, steal, borrow and beg
I'm still talking about that bad thing, king heroin
When you want to look for a vein in your arm or your leg
I felt so bad I didn't know what to do
He said, more priceless than diamond, more treasured than gold
More important than whiskey more deadly than wine
It'll just give you discomfort and no piece of mind
And when you come out the nod, he said you'll always be aware
You've shot every drop of your heart and it's full of fear
Now you must rush out and hit another sting

What my baby needs now
Is a little more loving
What my baby needs now
Is a little more loving

One day, found myself
Feeling sad
But then I remembered
All the times that we had

Then I knew it
Wasn't what I was doing
I found out for myself
It was what I
Wasn't doing for you
And I said

[Chorus]

Some people laughing
They don't know what it's all about
And I, I promise myself
I, I, I won't lose out

I love you, darling
I know it's true
And when the times get hard
I know you're gonna see me through

Stronger day by day
And when people
Try to break us up
I say, ain't no way

You see man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load

Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little bit of baby girls
And a baby boys
Man makes them happy
'Cause man makes them toys

And after man's made everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing
Without a woman or a girl

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.

Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Careful how you tell him that
He'll take you for granted and use you for a Sunday hat

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

This is a very, very unusual way to come to you

Now let's make our next year be as nice as this year
Now Christmas gotta be the kind of a Christmas
That we remember a long time ago

You remember when everybody used to look forward to it, Santa Claus
You'd wanna know what you gonna have the next day
You couldn't wait until Christmas morning to jump up

But that's the morning you wouldn't go to your table
You go straight to your little sack
Hanging on the mantle over the fireplace

Let's make this Christmas mean something this year
Let's make this Christmas mean something this year

You know I just enjoy this and I, I can't really can't find enough words
That would really make me express myself the good feelings that I have
But I wanna say thanks, thanks to God and now
Let's make Christmas the kind of a Christmas that we'd remember

But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in bitterness",It's a Man's World,2005

Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Michael, message to Michael

In his search to find wealth and fame
I hear Michael has gone and changed his name

It's a year since he was here

And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
Tell him I miss him more each day
As his train pulled out down the track
Michael promised he'd soon be coming back

Oh tell him how my heart just breaks in two
Since he journeyed far
And even though his dreams of fame fell through
To me he will always be a star

James Brown,"You know
We’re dealing with
A very critical and crucial times
Most, crucial and critical time that I've ever witnessed
Being as young as I am
You know
We all don't want to say nothing else, so we say “as young as we are”
Now I want to talk about
The pronunciation
And the realization
Now the educators
They call it
E.S.P.
Positive thinking, right?
Some of the people across the other side of the pond call it
Vibes
Vibrations
Astrology and all those different things you understand

But I call it, what it is and what it is
What it is and what it is

Lookie here
Now you see
A brother
You take in the ghetto you find a whole lot of crime
I can understand
Hey
I know what it means
Being nine years old before I got my first pair of underwear out of a store
You know
Putting on a half
A half pressed suit
From the pawn shop
With tennis shoes
Trying to be hip
See I know where it's coming from
Like the fellow say, “having catfish head stew”
And then like the catfish went in there with his head and come out very quick and didn't leave nothing else!
Now, there's one thing that the educators and the politicians and the establishment
Gotta remember
Now, brothers need jobs

If you don't work
You can't eat
If you don't work
You can't eat
Get hip to yourself, good God, my brother, and get it from the street
If you don't work
You can't eat
Sis
If you don't work, Lord
You can't eat

So you’ve got to have mind power to deal with starvation
And that's what we’re dealing with
You see we can't
Go back to the biblical stories
“2 loaves of bread”
Or “2 little fishes, 5 loaves of bread”
“2 little fishes” yeah
“5 loaves of bread""

James Brown,"Now a good friend of mine
Sat with me and he cried
He told me a story
I know he ain't lying

Said he went for a job
And Mr. Man said
Without an education
You might as well be dead

Now don't get me wrong
He said, it's not who you are
But people come to me
From near and far

But I do just what
And I follow the rules
I didn't have an education
So I had to go back to school

Tell me one more time, people now
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

One more time
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

My friends told all his buddies
That he loved so well
And of their personal troubles
I will not tell

Now those guys didn't seem good
And they didn't seem bad
They didn't seem so happy
And I know they weren't sad

But the point isn't
That they follow the rules
They got an education
And they all been in school

Now underneath his tears
I could see the true fact
When he dropped out of school
He never, never went back

Tell me one more time, people
What do you say?
Without an education
You might as well be dead

Got to, got to, got to listen now, now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

So one day he got tired
Of his little spending change
So he looked up his friends
To check their pay range

When he got there, the crib
He found that he was a drag
'Cause man, they were clean
And his clothes were like rags

One was a business man
With the plenty of dough
He had his thing so set up
You know he couldn't blow

The other had his job so uptight
He had his whole family
And his kids all out of sight

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

What made him so hurt
That these were his friends and he was a drag
They looked at him
And he was in the same old bag

For his friends they worked real hard
When the work day was through
Now, he realized
He should have done the same thing too

Tell me one more time now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to get a little learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

For the last time, I'm gonna say
They kept on pushing
When the going was tough
And now they know
That things don't seem so rough

So kids, stay in school
Don't be no drag
Take a fool's advise
And stay out of that bag

Look here, tell me, Bobby tell me one more time
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Tell me, The Jewels, tell me now one more time
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Everybody, tell me one more time
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

You got to, got to, got to, got to get some learning now
What do you say?
Without an education
Might as well be dead

Don't be a drop-out, stay in school now listen to me
What do you say?
Kids, kids
Might as well be dead

No, no
What do you say?

And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little Green Apples,2008

There was a day, now dig this
There was a day, they call it the Jerk

We all get together in time, for rhythm with you
So come and walk

There was a day that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler
I do the best that I can do

Crack and thunder, is closing in, is closing in
The rain floods gutters, and makes a great sound on the concrete
On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain 
Aerial held high, calling ""come on thunder, come on thunder""

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul 

It's a monsoon, and the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore 

The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign
And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on 

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul 

There's four new colors in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain 
He says listen, takes my head and puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea

With the exception of an exceptional feud I view
Impose the arsonists to burn a bunch, extreme kerosene
Helium dioxide aquanated oxide acquitted lop side

Where we at first is where we at last, where we last cash
One last toke will make your smoke ride high
I'ma give everything like pushing the button
Now how does it feel when you die for nothing?
Metropolis crumble, apocalypse mo' lines surround and dine
Let loose in at least a Nam, calculate keep time
Finish the World War I've been a star
The knock quiminitar(?), strange and restrain
Retired and rewired, melodically molecules
Strategy and logic enables our positions then points us missiles
All sided equal... deeper than pistols
For instance... unknown the science of forensics

Hit like ten sticks hit with the effect of tense ticks inglow(?) sticks

Popped out bodies dropped off on Rider's road
I've seen and foreseen the unseen
And able hardly able to separate the myths from fables
I'ma buy a Baltic while you purchase fireplaces
Poisonous supply and occupy in space
The midnight I could hide the dark until the spark
Light up the night nothing everything in sight
I'ma cross the finish line with both legs broken
Flow coke broken both toke smokin' (wha?)

The life of a party is a live scene

A million percent proof bound to found the youth
Uncrude uncoil bubble and boil turmoil
Don't specialize and ill crack your bones
Now fuck with that (automatic cardiac attack)

Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together in time, for rhythm with you
So come and walk

There was a day that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler
I do the best that I can do

There was a time, sometimes I dance
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet

Where we all
Soon will be

You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me

But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way

Should have stayed a great unknown

Would have suited Jesus best

Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour

Are you that, breaking the wall will your building respond?
To the pressure, walking with the strength of my predecessor
Ancient, I never walk alone
I'm up against the stereo-mono-typical
Visualising wealth is not applicable
Now, my brain cries out for me to read
With movement inspired by Johnsy D and Benjy Read

[Chorus]
The Globe keeps spinning (The hole damn world is)
But I ain't moving (Excuse me?)
We can't keep joking (No no no no)
Break the lock if the door's not open now (Break it down break it down)
The Globe keeps spinning (The hole damn world is)
But I ain't moving (Excuse me?)
We can't keep joking (No no no no)
Break the lock if the door's not open now

Concepts get abandoned with no gloves
Traditional trends evaporate like soap suds
The innercity whirlpool will suck you up like
A person with a temper can [fuck] you up right?
Time to bring back down to syndromes
Custard in your eye like Bugsy Malone
You need to stay calm with napalm attached to ya
Embrace arm in gasoline strike a match to ya
Now, now do you feel enlightened?
Well I don't and I'm the one writing
Anything versus everything really means nothing
Can't be a king peacock - I hate strutting
Dressed up semi-jiggy I might frustrate somethin'
A lion in the wardrobe is ready to break somethin'
Mr Fantastic Fox
the Awkward individ' that makes the wack [shit] hot
My jazz addiction is a preminition of war
When visible tussels appear on the dance floor
The sweat breaks to the beat, freak of the month, year, decade
Vacuum the essay, now lets say
I'm one in a million, a million in one room
You want an interview with the killer of monsoons?
I'll sing sonnets to don and donnettes, ok?
I'm terrible with a broom sweeping your mess away

[Chorus]

""...two, three, break!"" x3",Break the Lock,2001

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

James Campbell,"Anyone can whistle, that's what they say, easy
Anyone can whistle any old day, easy
It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why can't I

I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why, why can't I
I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me
Whistle for me

James Campbell,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2000
James Campbell,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

It would drive away all my fears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes, lord
They are tears
Oh, now, oh

Oh right now

These ain't raindrops in my eyes, baby
That I wipe away
If you tell me you love me
Everything will be okay, now
If I thought that you'll ever love me
I would wait, I would wait a million years

These ain't raindrops in my eyes, lord
These ain't raindrops in my eyes, lord
They are tears
Oh, now, oh

Ain't no cryin' 'cause I've been to heaven
So how can there be rain?
The man up there, he knows just how I feel, now, oh

How will I face tomorrow
And all the lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely years?

These ain't raindrops in my eyes, baby
These ain't raindrops in my eyes, lord

Don't make me shed no more tears right now

But I just can't keep it all to myself now

For as long as I've been running around
I finally met a little girl that really got me down now

Baby, you've got my mind messed up, now
Little girl, little girl, you sure got my mind messed up, now

I go to bed alone and I can't sleep
Sit down at the table, ooh, Lord, I can't eat

Somebody, please, please help me now, oh, oh, oh

Every day you're with me seem like Valentine's now

I walked a rainbow, Lord and I chained the moon
Walk around the world and get back before noon, now

Baby, you've got my mind messed up
Darling, sure got my mind messed up now

Eyes wide open, Lord and I can't see
Anywhere the woman go she can lead for me

Somebody just gotta, just gotta help me, oh, oh-wee, oh, now

Baby, you've got my mind messed up now
You sure got my mind messed up now

You my love, with all of my heart

It's a miracle what love can do
All the joys romance can bring
Come smiling down on a heart that's true
When love is real, you can't turn it around
It's like a river running down to the sea
This old world turns around for lovers like you
It's not The Way Love Turned Out For Me.
 
People in love build a house they can share
Takes a long time to get it just right
But a fire can start in the kitchen somewhere
And burn that little house down overnight
That flame burning bright in your heart
I believed that you turned it on just for me
Another man held that fire 
Burned our house to the ground
That's The Way Love Turned Out For Me.
 
People turn out for the big show
Pretty flowers turn out in the spring
And the light turns out in the kitchen
When somebody pulls on the string
But there's no light burning in my kitchen
And no doors open up with my key
And I ain't got no one to turn to
