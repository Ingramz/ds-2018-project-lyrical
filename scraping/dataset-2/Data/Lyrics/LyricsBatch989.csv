Section,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road,2002
Section,"Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear 
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
But lately I am beginning to find 
That I should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes

So if I decide to waiver my chance 
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine 
And hold my own and drive?

It's driven me before 
And it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around
But lately I am beginning to find 
That when I drive myself my light is found

So whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes, yeah

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes

Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?
Would you choose water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?",Drive,2002
Section,"To see you when I wake up
Is a gift I didn't think could be real

To know that you feel the same as I do
Is a three-fold utopian dream

You do something to me that I can't explain
So would I be out of line if I said
I miss you?

I see your picture
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine

You have only been gone ten days
But already I'm wasting away

I know I'll see you again
Whether far or soon

But I need you to know that I care
And I miss you",I Miss You,2002
Section,"If I hadn't made me
I would have been made somehow

If I hadn't assembled myself
I'd have fallen apart by now

If I hadn't made me
I'd be more inclined to bow

Powers that would be have swallowed me up
But that's more than I can allow

If you let them make you
They'll make you papier-mâché
At a distance you're strong
Until the wind comes
Then you crumble and blow away

If you let them fuck you
There will be no foreplay
But rest-assured
They'll screw you complete
?Til your ass is blue and gray

You should only make amends with you
If only for better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?

If I hadn't made me
I'd have fallen apart by now

I won't let ?em make me
It's more than I can allow

So when I make me
I won't be papier-mâché

I'll fuck me in my own way

Why not try and make yourself?",Make Yourself,2002
Section,"A decade ago
I never thought I would be
At twenty-three
On the verge of spontaneous combustion
Wo-is-me

But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Not two days ago
I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, 'I can relate?'
Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication
As a welcomed vacation 
From the burdens of the planet earth

Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D
And thinking so much differently

So pardon me while I burst into flames

How do you do it?

But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high rise today

It's not a breeze ?cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know
Watch the warmth blow away

Do you think I should adhere
To that pressing new frontier
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?

Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

I was so young and vestal then,
You know it hurt me,
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
I've got my hands bound,
My head down, my eyes closed,
And my throat wide open. 
Do unto others what has been done to you 
I'm treading water,
I need to sleep a while.
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious.
Won't you come a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this,
I can't stand to burn too long.
Released in this sodomy.
For one sweet moment I am whole. 
Do unto you now what has been done to me. 
You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
Won't you come just a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this.
I need this to make me whole.
There's release in this sodomy.
For I am your witness that
Blood and flesh can be trusted.
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind. 
Got your hands bound, your head down,
Your eyes closed.
You look so precious now. 
Show me something
Thought I could make it end
Thought I could wash the stains away
Thought I could break the circle if I
Slipped right into your skin
So sweet was your surrender
We have become one
I have become my terror
And you my precious lamb and martyr.
I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit blood and cum on my hands.

You look so precious.",Prison Sex,2003
Section,"Gone under two times.
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
Speaks from deep
Beneath the cold black water.
It's twice as clear as heaven,
And twice as loud as reason.
It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
And just as undisturbing.
The currents mouth below me opens up around me.
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
It surrounds and drowns and sweeps me away. 
But I'm so comfortable, too comfortable. 
Shut up shut up shut up shut up
Shut up shut up shut up shut up 
You're saturating me
So how could I let this bring me
Back to my knees again again again 
Under for the third time.
I've been baptized by your voice.
It screams from deep beneath the endless water.
And it's half as high as heaven
And half as clear as reason.
It's cold and black like silt on the riverbed.
But I'm so comfortable.
Far too comfortable.
Why don't you kill me,
I'm weak and numb and insignificant,
And I'm back on my knees.
Lost in euphoria.
I'm back down. I'm in the undertow.
I'm helpless and awake in the undertow.
I'll die within your undertow.
It seems there's no other way out of this undertow.

I don't want to be dismal.
But I don't want to rot in an apathetic existence either.
See I want to believe you,
And I want to trust
And I want to have faith to put away the dagger. 
But you lie, cheat, and steal.
And yet I tolerate you.
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method 
While I smile and laugh and dance
And sing your praise and glory.
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance
And sing your glory
While you lie, cheat, and steal.
How can I tolerate you. 
Our guilt, our blame,
I've been far too sympathetic.
Our blood, our fault.

Choke this infant here before me.
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge and strike you down?
But you're
Pushing and shoving me.
You still love me and you pushit on me.
Rest your trigger on my finger,
Bang my head upon the fault line.
Take care not to make me enter.
Cause if I do we both may disappear.
But you're pushing me,
Shoving me. Pushit on me.
Slipping back into the gap again.
I'm alive when you're touching me,
Alive when you're shoving me down.
But I'd trade it all
For just a little bit of
Piece of mind.
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be.
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see.
Never wanna see that place again.
Saw that gap again today
As you were begging me to stay.
Managed to push myself away,
And you, as well.
If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,
I must persuade you another way.
There's no love in fear.
Staring down the hole again.
Hands upon my back again.

Section Quartet,"Gone under two times.
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
Speaks from deep
Beneath the cold black water.
It's twice as clear as heaven,
And twice as loud as reason.
It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
And just as undisturbing.
The currents mouth below me opens up around me.
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
It surrounds and drowns and sweeps me away. 
But I'm so comfortable, too comfortable. 
Shut up shut up shut up shut up
Shut up shut up shut up shut up 
You're saturating me
So how could I let this bring me
Back to my knees again again again 
Under for the third time.
I've been baptized by your voice.
It screams from deep beneath the endless water.
And it's half as high as heaven
And half as clear as reason.
It's cold and black like silt on the riverbed.
But I'm so comfortable.
Far too comfortable.
Why don't you kill me,
I'm weak and numb and insignificant,
And I'm back on my knees.
Lost in euphoria.
I'm back down. I'm in the undertow.
I'm helpless and awake in the undertow.
I'll die within your undertow.
It seems there's no other way out of this undertow.

Half of your heart might be ruled by the evil
Still you look for some love in some way
You are afraid, hear what we say

Put the spot on our treasure
The love goddess, the queen of pleasure
Even odd is her measure
A heavy shock cold and hot
She is like the weather
Do not block, better rock

Show what you adore
Take what you've got
Break on through the door
You cannot find more
Than what you look for
Her love shot, increases the score

Love is unkind if you step outta line
She's a cold, she's a warm hearted mother-a-a
Love is divine if you enter right in time
You better check it next time

Put the spot 'pon the queen
We want her, she's so hot
True love goes from one to another
Get, shot her arrow, choose
I to play inna drama
Six kids now call me father

For every coin there's a slot
You miss it once, twice or more
Then you think you had your lot
Queen is known to be moody

Try again till you got through to her
Then she'll say, ""go on your way
Now that's all""
Well, at least you have been heard

Love is unkind if you step outta line
She's a cold, she's a warm hearted mother-a-a
Love is divine if you enter right in time
You better check it next time

You get hot
Another trophy that I'm taking home
You've had a lot
Can I ever please her majesty?
You pick a loss

Had to feel it, yes, she let me know
It's not all that has a sparkle that is gold
Hotter than hot
Love is our treasure
We have a lot

But we've got to pass it over
Don't interrupt
So come let's go and spread it out
And you'll see, we can please her over time

East to the west will be a kingdom of happiness
I am your emperor you are my empress yes

This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio ,this tune I have to spread

Wake up ,girl its now and ever
We 've been sleeping to long
I'm afraid life's almost over
Taaake off the nasty shell around you
Let's go for what we lost way back so long ago
I want to see your funny side again
Take me to your heart where it all began
I promise I'll do all I can for
This is the very last chance
To let our love light shine again

Move girl let's get out of bed
This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio ,this tune I have spread

wake up woman,
There's something that I want you to see
A brand new you and me
Here just waitin to be
Here is my hand
And meet me half of the way
Sweatheart we 're sharing this day
And I don't wish to stay
The way that I am,
I see the circumstances are strange
How I want you to change,
But still stay the same
The less that we talk,
The more time to try
And while you were sleeping,
Time pass by

Girl let's get out of bed
This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag
Boom! Pop the radio ,this tune I have to spread

This will be the best day that we ever had
We could rob a bank than quit the money bag

Seeed,"I big up the same place since back in stone age
This is my main stage I owe the whole space
Take it for free babes don't wait in vain chase
The slow center of the storm where everything lasts on

I ride on my wave no matter where I got it's there
I fly my light safe, I am declared I am aware that I am fool and brave
I build my thrones, I break my bones
I am my kingdoms rave, I never rest things move on fast

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Slowly freakin' out, hear me now speakin' out
Won't be speakin' loud
How do you feel about listening to crazy men?
Whose minds, sneakin' out
A hazy sense of evidence for what life is all about

It's real love and everything, a family, no scattering
Daddy swing the children like Hollywood happy end
Just like so many men, I look for almost everything
Meanwhile whistling, here we go sing again

No matter how close to perfect it is
It's taken me too far, I'm afraid, I'm obsessed with it, vex with it
Good's not enough, be the best in it
In order to the best, I can never stop flexin' it

You flex it to the max and it feels like sex with it
It's made you to the boss and you feel you're blessed with it
Now everybody wants it, you start protecting it
This is when you wish you had no more stress with it, so

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Going for a slowlife

Seeed,"Der Asphaltboden zitterte es wummerte im Ohr
Als ich an einen dicken Beat mein junges Herz verlor
Seit damals gefällt mir die Stadt besser als zuvor
Wenn ich durch Berlin-City cruise is Reggae mein Motor

Ich singe auf dem Fahrrad, mal Bass und mal Tenor
Zuhause dreh ich Sound auf, die Nachbarn ham Humor
Die stehn auf frische Downbeats aus meinem Recordstore
Concrete Jungle, Supersonic - Soundsystemkultur

Wenn Party is, dann sind wir on the dance floor
Der Deejay macht den Vers und die Jarvis den Chor
Du versinkst im Bass wie´ne Moorleiche im Moor
Es zwingt dich in die Knie, denn der Riddim is Hardcore

Wir shaken, was wir haben bis morgens 7 Uhr
Woanders gibt´s 'ne Sperrstunde, bei uns die Müllabfuhr
Dann baun wir´n dickes Rohr, kommt dann schon mal vor
Und blasen dicken Smoke durchs Brandenburger Tor

Wir lieben deinen Duft, wenn wir um die Häuser ziehen

Die Berliner Luft im Vergleich zu anderen Städten
Bietet leckersten Geschmack, allerbeste Qualitäten
Um Paraden zu feiern und exklusive Feten
Die Massen sind jetzt da, es hat sie niemand drum gebeten!

Früher ging's in Berlin nur um Panzer und Raketen
Heute lebe ich im Osten zwischen Blümchentapeten
Kümmer mich nicht allzu sehr um Taler und Moneten
Baue hier und da´n Track, aber dafür´n konkreten!

Coolness-mäßig platzt die Stadt aus allen Nähten
Aber wo sind jetzt die Typen, die auch ernsthaft antreten
Um ihr Potential, ihre Styles heiß zu kneten
Zuviel Kraft in der Lunge für zu wenige Trompeten

Everybody come the reggae vibes dem all a study
Make we take a check up pan the crew dem way promote it
Cause a reggae well it come fe run the city
Every monday night you now say dat a escobar
Coming from near me say you coming from far
Every tuesday night you now say dat a tanzbar
Everybody go dey want fe look like a star
Every wensday night you can go check out subground
Way the reggae musik mash the whole place down
Black kappa voice comming through di mikrophone
An make me say one love to all of the sound
Big up Barney Millah , Concrete Jungle crew dem
Big up Panza, Supersonic crew dem
Big up Alex an the Such A Sound crew dem

You can be my lover
I don't need another

The game we want

How it will be done
No time to waste
And no reason to wait
You always give me update
You are my number one
We pull up and stay up
Here we are strong
This is our way
And that's were we belong
Feel it day by day
Til those days are gone
We all gotta pay
But we all gain some
Crazy for your style
I wanna smoke it like dope
Your ideas make me smile
Your ideals gimme hope
Kiss my soul with your eyes
Love is globber than the globe
Everyday I realize
I feel for you this ain't no joke

Just lying down in the dust and a bloody dirty crust
Is running up and down your nose

Come on, enough is enough, I'm too tough to give it away
One of my demons will pay

Zieh mich schick an setzt 'n Hut auf
Die Rolex tickt, man seh ich gut aus
Hol mir den kick den ich absolut brauch
Yeah, wieder mal'n Soloausritt
In dem Poseroutfit, mach ich's mir nett, mach mich brett-fett
Rauch Shit, wo sind die bräute mit Poserauschnitt

Komm in den Club und genieß den Ausblick
Die Braut is Schmuck und die is auch schick
Ich sing 'ne Hook, bei der jede austickt
Meine Frau guckt krass wenn sie's rauskriegt
Mm egal, mal 'n ausgang muss auch mal drin sein,
Bin kein Hausmann brauch unbedingt ein Drink der taugt ran
An die Bar, ich laber ne Frau an
Für die Lady und für mich sieben Mojito
Mit einem mal gefällt mir jedes Lied so,
Tanz sogar zum Song von Placebo
Bin blau und die Dame dito

Ooh du hübsches Ding, ich versteck meinen Ehering,
Klinglingeling wir könntens bring
Doch wir nuckeln nur am Drink
Ooh du hübsches Ding, du bist Queen und ich bin King,
Wenn ich dich seh' dann muss ich sing
Tingalingaling you pretty thing

Wir sind blau, wir sind spitz,
Zu Hause sitzt die Frau mit Kids,
Im Augenblick bekämpf ich den Wunsch,
Der wie jeder sehen kann in meinen Augen blitzt!

Alter, krasse Braut, sie sagt ""lass es raus"",
Und ist heiß daraus loszulegen
Ich muss Zeit gewinn',
Bestell weiter Drinks, sie is nicht mein Ding
Versuch ich mir einzureden

Lächerlich! Ich becher mich weg,
Barkeeper hau raus was in deinen Fässern steckt,
Ich saufs aus weil's mich vergessen lässt:
Meine Gedanken sind besessen von Sex!

Sie will Offensive vom Mann, doch
Ich bin besoffen, schiele sie an, kurz darauf
Liegt mein Kopf neben der Toilette, hätte nie gewettet
Das Kotzen meine Ehe rettet!

Ooh du hübsches Ding, ich versteck meinen Ehering,
Klinglingeling wir könntens bring
Doch wir nuckeln nur am Drink
Ooh du hübsches Ding, du bist Queen und ich bin King,
Wenn ich dich seh' dann muss ich sing
Tingalingaling you pretty thing
Oh

See that burning body (hot)
Those boobs in a naughty,
(Top) red lips so juicy, (oh God)
In the middle of your web, please don't stop!
Take my brain turn it off
Don't feel shame, don't feel love,
More champagne for our game,
It's insane but it's aaah!
Do you wanna ruin my life? Say what!
You wanna tell my wife? Please stop!
Things are getting real tight, I never thought
You'd set me up!
All I wanted was a body for delight ""let's get naughty"":
You said, right! Now you say you love me day and night!
Who's gonna save me from this fright?

Ooh du hübsches Ding, ich versteck meinen Ehering,
Klinglingeling wir könntens bring

Wir hab´n uns angesteckt

Heute ist es heiß 
Sonne macht geil und weil das so ist
Scheint sie heute zum Beweis 
Das Radio klingt feist
Gestern war in den Top 10 scheiß 
Heute ist die Liste heiß
Und du tanzt
Das dich Gott für deine Kiste preist

Das leben will ein´n ausgeb´n Aufstehn
Und das will ich sehn
Lass uns endlich raus geh´n 
Das Radio aufdreh´n
Das wird unser Tag Babe
Wenn wir aufsteh´n 

Steh auf jetzt oder nie Girl zu viel geschlafen
Und das Leben ist halb vorbei 
Ich steh drauf wie du tanzt zu dem Lied
Wir hol´n uns zurück was irgendwann auf der Strecke blieb 
I want to see your funny side again
Take me to your heart where it all began 
I promise I do all I can for this is the very last chance 
To let our love light shine again

Wieg' zehn Tonnen, binnenleer
Dreh' mich im Kreis, seh' nichts mehr
Jeder Weg, führt wieder hier her
Mal meine Wand an, rabenschwarz
Bin müde und, schlaf' am Tag
Lieg' flach, glotz' in mein Grab
Geier auf'n Dach, warten auf Aas

Rufe mich nich' an ich bin tot
Meine Haut grün die Augen rot
Lad' mich nich' ein denn da wo ich hingeh', regnet es bloß

Der Graben tief und zu groß
Doch irgendwo aus dem Nichts, ein Blick für den es sich lohnt

Komme jeden Tag besuch' dich
Alle in deinem Kiez verfluchen mich
Stehen in deinem Hof sing schiefes Lied
Das Haus tobt booya flieg im Beat
Aus dem Nichts wurde schwarz zu bunt
Aus dem Platz an der Bar wurde Haus und Hund
Du bist schön ich geh der Sache auf den Grund
Und dein Bauch wird rund

Baby geh mit mir raus ans Licht
Ich glaube an Gott denn er baute dich
Ausgerechnet ich bin im Garten Eden

You know how it goes ya'll
If one girl's there, another will come

New Madame makes me gaze and stun
Have to raise my thumb, she's a loaded gun
Cool me down for my brain is gone
If no savior comes, I'm gonna burn my hand

(They'll tell it!)Some guy's wanna spy out and tellele
(Yell it!) My wife's gonna cry out and yellele
(They'll smell it) The dogs will sniff it and smell it,
Retell it then the press gonna buy it and sellele

(Easy)So simmer down and please let me go

So better watch out Mr. Dellelé

And I wonder yes I wonder, wisely that you choose

And I wonder girl I wonder, wisely that you choose

I never thought, I'd be like this
In the palm of your hand, happily speechless

You saved my life, when no one believed
You gave up diamonds for a rolling stone

Alle bleiben wach, im Paradies
Flieger malen Streifen, in das Blau
Die Sonne scheint, das Eis taut
Immer grüner Rasen, der Pudel bellt
Sieh! Erste Wahl, erste Welt
Milch und Honig fließen, doch hinterm Haus
Ziehen Wolken auf

Die Glotze glüht du inhalierst den Dreck
Die Nachrichten sind schlecht du schießt dich weg
Wartest ab bis irgendwas passiert
Erwartest, dass der Messias kommt

Das Licht geht an, der Turm ist leer
Keiner kommt und teilt das Meer
Niemand sagt, uns wie es geht
Niemand weiß, den geraden weg
Doch diese Zeit, ist deine Zeit
Und du meinst, du seist noch nicht so weit
Doch jeder Tag, ruft deinen Namen
Du weißt, du hast keine Wahl

5 vor Mitternacht, ich lieg' noch wach
Die Türme fallen, stehen im Schach
Mein Kopf hebt Gewichte, mein Herz macht Krach
Sitz‘ auf'm Nagelbett, es hagelt auf‘s Dach
Bombenwetter, Blutdruck steigt
Die Luft geladen, mir wird’s heiß
Wer kommt und kettet sich, die Welt ans Bein
Möge die Macht, mit ihm sein

Slowly but steady

We blast our trunks
Like baritone horns

The rumble of the earth keeps you moving on
And nothing ain't stopping us

Pounding drums

I go to far, you pull me back
I lose my temper, get caught in anger
You cool me down I surrender
You move rocks out of the way

You take me as I am everyday
We light up the dark of the night
Come see two stars collide

You make my shell fall apart
Scars and scratches, I show you mine

Still at the dock
Before we're off
Let's lock it up
Throw away the keys into the sea

Vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find a comfort

Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere

And a will to hold on
There's a trapdoor in the sun

As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks
Beneath the door

Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered, executed anyhow
Scrawls dissolved
Cigar box on the floor

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on to
There's a trapdoor in the sun

Running out the door
Coming up a which way sign
And all good truants must decide

And whiskers in the sink

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

What am I without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose the crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this daze forever
Now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm

Weil sich ihr hässlicher Charakter leider nicht photoshoppen lässt
Das Leben ist wie Lose ziehen du kannst morgen schon draufgehen!
Aber wer die Rosen liebt, muss die Dornen in Kauf nehmen
Immer wenn es eklig wird (eklig wird), beten wir
Karma ist nicht weit entfernt, sondern auf dem Weg zu dir
Und was ich sage, kann ein Knick in deiner Würde sein

Trotzdem wird mein Album ausgecheckt wie ’ne Präsidentensuite
Eure fünf Minuten Fame sind euch zu Kopf gestiegen
Ich meine, letztes Jahr noch habt ihr meinen Cock bestiegen
Jetzt, wo es zu spät ist, rufst du an und fragst „Verstehst du mich?“

Merde, pose le micro on va te le rentrer dans le boule

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless,2001

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away

Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'

You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Porque yo llevo to el dia sufriendo 
y es que la quiero con toda el alma 
y la persigo en mis pensamientos 
de madrugada. 

Tengo una cosa que me arde dentro, 
que no me deja pensar en nada, 
ay que no sea de esa chiquilla 
y de su mirada 

¡Y yo la miro!, 
y ella no, me dice nada. 
pero sus dos ojos negros 
se me clavan como espadas, 
pero sus dos ojos negros 
se me clavan como espadas. 

¡¡ay chiquilla!! 

Ese silencio que me desvive, 
me dice cosas que son tan claras, 
que yo no puedo, no puedo, no puedo, dejar de mirarla. 

Y yo le tengo que decir pronto, 
que estoy loquito de amor por ella, 
y que sus ojos llevan el fuego 
de alguna estrella. 

Que las palabras se quedan cortas, 
para decir todo lo que siento 
pues mi chiquilla es lo más bonito 
del firmamento. 

(Estribillo) 

¡Y yo la miro! 
y ella no, me dice nada

El sol siempre es amarillo
Y la lluvia y las nubes,
No pueden velar tanto brillo.

Ni los árboles nunca,
Podrán ocultar el camino
De su luz hacia el bosque perdido,
De nuestro destino.

Se ve como un manto lejano

Que se puede alcanzar con sólo volar.

Van donde quieren,
No los mandas tú.

Por el cielo va cruzando,
Por el cielo color azul.

Diez mil metros de altitud.

Desde tierra saludan con la mano
Se va alejando,
No sé donde va
No sé donde va.

Sobre un tramo de vía,
Cruzando un paisaje de ensueño
En un tren que me lleva de nuevo,
A ser muy pequeño.

De una américa a otra,
Tan sólo es cuestión de un segundo
Basta con desearlo,
Y podrás recorrer todo el mundo.

Un muchacho que trepa,
Que trepa a lo alto de un muro
Si se siente seguro,
Verá su futuro con claridad.

Y el futuro es un nave,
Que por el tiempo volará
A Saturno, después de Marte,
Nadie sabe donde llegará.

Si le ves venir, si te trae amores,
No te los roben sin apurar
Aprovecha los mejores,
Que después no volverán.

La esperanza jamás se pierde,
Los malos tiempos pasarán.
Piensa que el futuro es una acuarela,
Y tu vida un lienzo que colorear (que colorear)

En los mapas del cielo,
El sol siempre es amarillo
Tú lo pintarás.

No pueden velar tanto brillo

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

My stupid heart is always a casualty
It wants to be loved, it hates the vacancy
My time is yours, waste it carefully
You hit and run, do it gracefully

Oh, please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
See, I've been running for far too long
Oh, please be good to me

Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Woah, woah, be good to me

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Be good to me
It’s all I'm asking from you
You know I'm counting on you
To lead me to nirvana
Be good to me
It's all I'm asking from you
You know I'm counting on you

Seinabo Sey,"So you say, all you wanna be is remembered
I'll make you go down in history
So you say, all you wanna be is remembered
Let me make you go down in history, baby

Let write you into history, darling
Let me sing you into eternity
So you say you just wanna be remembered
You just wanna be remembered
Just wanna be remembered
So sing me words that no one's heard
Split me an ocean (ooh)
Make my mountain move
Maybe I'll remember you
Oh, baby, I'll remember you
Show me a God that I can believe in
Show me some stars
Beneath this, beneath this ceiling
And I'll remember you
Baby, I'll remember you

And if I'm not the one
Holding the smoking gun
When the trumpets call
You can send me to the lord
Whatever we become
I was there before it all
When the morning comes
You can sing me to the sun

Walk on water
Take me to a space
So be blessed
Where I could ease my mind
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I'll remember you

And if I'm not the one
Holding the smoking gun
When the trumpets call
You could send me to the Lord
Whatever we become
I was there before it all
When the morning comes
You could sing me to the sun
You could sing me to the sun

Remember me, remember me
Remember me under the sun

Seine Gala Big Band,"Danke schoen, darling, Danke schoen,
Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony was the place we'd meet,
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park in fall how you tore you dress,
What a mess, I confess that's not all.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined for all time.
Yours and mine, that was fine.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for seeing me again.
Tho' we go on our sep'rate ways
Still the mem'ry stays for always.",Dankeschön [Swing][*],2005
