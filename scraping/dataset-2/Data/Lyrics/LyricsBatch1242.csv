Utopia,"Some days go on forever, 
Last long into the night, 
Some days feel like December, although its warm on the inside. 
Forget the middle of summer, 
I bet you I am alive. 
We'll wipe the floors together, nice try. 

Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 

Some days are complicated, 
Some ways I'll take the blame, 
Some days I take it all to, heart again. 
This place is made of panic, 
They check you every mile, 
Thank God you're going out for, a while. 

Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 

Nobody noticed what you're talking about, 
Nobody's got a clue what you're all about. 
Save it all. 
Save it all. 
(rock)? 

Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 
You're a black hole! 
You're a black hole!",Black Hole,
Utopia,"I never was bothered by bad dreams
They never made me afraid
But then I never did dream I'd wake up
And find me in the freak parade.

I guess I had to find out the hard way
I shouldn't have been so proud
'Cause here I'm the main attraction
Of every giggle in the crowd.

So I gotta
Take my place in the freak parade
See my face in the freak parade.
In a world full of freaks
You can creep, you can crawl
But the world's biggest freak
Is the one with no balls.

You know you shouldn't poke fun at strangers
Or pity their case at all
'Cause there are lots of friends and lovers
That take it kind of personal.

You might appreciate our position
Don't laugh at our freaky ways
You might find yourself tomorrow
Marching in the freak parade.

You better
Take your place in the freak parade
See your face in the freak parade
Get of the sidewalk!",Freak Parade,1974
Utopia,"Tucked away in the darkest cupboard of your heart
There's a feeling you can't let out
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind
You are marching, what are you marching about?

On your mark, now get set
Get back on your feet
We ain't down yet
You know we will get it
So don't you forget
That the world rolls on.

Your reward will come
It's just a question of how and when
Look around, everyone is wondering where it's at
Do you wonder, or do you know?

Clap your hands! Raise your voice
Some people will hide
They can't stand the noise
But we're freedom fighters
And we've got no choice.

In a way you are just a soldier of the mind
But the world rolls on.
Your reward will come

And the truth will come and the change will come
It's just a question of how and when
I can't believe my eyes.",Freedom Fighters,1974
Utopia,"On a day like no other
In a time unique, in a place divine
Keep your eye on the Ikon
Shining in the light of eternal mind.

I went to sleep a blind man
But when I awoke I saw
The legions of the lonely
See their faces, hear them call.

See how they hang on
Each one in a world of his own design
Listen to the Ikon
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.

And the music plays forever
And it captures every ear
And the sound of barriers crashing down
Is the sweet harmony you hear.

Still, be still
To strong, so be still
Much too long, come down
Be still, look around
Listen here, be still
Hear the sound, be still.

Still we are here
We are still
Will we sing sweet
Sing we will
Still we are here
We are still
Nil is a fear all is nil
Still we are here we are still
Spill it let go let it spill.

The question comes to mind
About what should be done
And how much of the old will die
That the new may be begun
But you don't have to be afraid
Of being alone with nowhere to run.

You don't have to be afraid
To look yourself in the eye
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.

Someone knows who you are
Someone watches over you
Someone knows how you feel
And someone feels the same.

So you don't have to be afraid
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind

For those who still recoil
For those who fear the pain
Of peering o'er the edge of
A new and different plane.

You don't have to be afraid
Whenever you go you come back again
So you don't have to be afraid
We live and we die
You don't have to be afraid to know why.

You do",The Ikon,1974
Utopia,"City in my head, Utopia
Heaven in my body, Utopia
It's time for me, for me to go

City in my head, Utopia
Heaven in my body, Utopia
Into the sky, it rises now
",Utopia Theme [Live],1974
Utopia,"In this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air
Hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you.

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
Woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That i've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love",Do Ya,1975
Utopia,"It's like a normal Times Square day on 42nd Street
I feel like trashing some windows and crunching some feet
I watch society crumble and I just laugh (hee hee)
They soon will see what it's like to be the other half

But I'm trying
Said I'm trying to forget
And it ain't happened yet
I must of woke up this morning with a bug up my ass

I think I'll just haul off and belt the next jerk that I pass
My old man says I'm just a stoned little punk
But he keeps himself a pistol and he's always drunk
I know

Something's gonna give
Pretty soon
I know it
Something's gonna give

I want to live
I want to mess thing whole world around
Go on and poison all the water, use up all the air
Blow your stupid heads off, see if I could care

Put me down but don't blame me for what you did
'Cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid
I was a sweet little kid once
Now I'm a full grown crank

And when I die I'll probably come back as a Sherman tank
I know that I could make this world so peaceful and calm
If I could only get my hands on a hydrogen bomb",Heavy Metal Kids,1975
Utopia,"Something's Coming Lyrics
Could be!
Who knows?
There's something due any day;
I will know right away
Soon as it shows.
It may come cannon ballin' down through the sky,
Gleam in its eye,
Bright as a rose!
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Under a tree.
I got a feeling there's a miracle due,
Gonna come true,
Coming to me!
Could it be? Yes it could.
Something's coming, something good,
If I can wait!
Something's coming, I don't know what it is
But it is
Gonna be great!
With a click, with a shock,
Phone'll jingle, door'll knock,
Open the latch!
Something's coming, don't know when, but it's soon -
Catch the moon,
One-handed catch!
Around the corner,
Or whistling down the river,
Come on - deliver
To me!
Will it be? Yes it will.
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there!
Come on something, come on in, don't be shy,
Meet a guy,
Pull up a chair!
The air is humming,
And something great is coming!
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Maybe tonight...",Something's Coming,1975
Utopia,"Did you see the color of the water coming out of the tap?
 Did you hear the chatter of the hammer
 when you're trying to nap?
 There's nothing on the counter at the A&P store
 The bank don't even bother now to open
It ain't pretty, pity
 Abandon city
Everybody over the side
 The hour is late, they're closing the gate, no time to decide
 Abandon city
 Yeah, you better run for your lives
 There's nothing to spare
 The cupboard is bare
 The bees have all left the hive
 Someone's doing a non-stop performance of ""The Rape of the Lock""
 No one's got the nerve to take a tiptoe after seven o'clock
 And everybody's looking for a piece of the rock
 And I just want to get my Cadillac out of hock
 Too much nitty gritty",Abandon City,1977
Utopia,"They tell me I've paid back the debt I owed
 Forty-four months since the slammer door closed
 They give me a suit and put me back on the road
 And my thoughts are racing
 Where do I go? What am I supposed to live on?
 What happens when the twenty-five dollars is gone?
 That leaves me lots of time to wonder why I was born
 But the countdown is on
 Everybody's dancing
 The music sounds entrancing
 But you can't find the beat
 It's the ticking of a thousand human time bombs
 Who are back on the street
 Oh the names have been changed
 But the story's the same
 History will repeat
 Add it all up and then divide it by zero
 'Cause you're back on the street
 I can't stand the strain of this job no more
 I must have forgot what I took it on for
 I make lots of money, yet still I want more
 And my head is blazing
 I think that I'll check out the shops downtown
 Sometimes it helps to buy things when I feel brought down
 At this hour I might dodge those hippie low-life's around
 But the countdown is on
 Once you had to stand out
 Looking for a handout
 Free love and body heat
 And that money's just a crumpled green be	
When you're back on the street
 Back on the street again
 Said you're back on the street again
 The countdown is on
 And nobody knows when
 Spreading like a cancer
 Looking for the answer
 In everyone you meet
 And each in his way has a hustle to play
 When he's back on the street",Back on the Street,1977
Utopia,"Lost through a hole in the garden wall
 On the wrong side of the looking glass
 Call, should you need a companion home
 You know you only need to ask
 Crazy Lady Blue
I sympathize with what you're going through
 Crazy Lady Blue
 I'm crazy just to have you be my love
 Hide in the puzzle you call your world
 Baby, I know all about the game
 Cry when the walls of the maze crash down
 I'll come and take away your pain
 Crazy Lady Blue
 Someday your head may get the best of you
 Crazy Lady Blue
 I'm crazy just to have you be my love",Crazy Lady Blue,1977
Utopia,"If it's dangerous, illegal, sick, strange, or obscene
 You can get it from the man if your money is green
 He says, ""You can have it""
 He knows once you get it
 You won't be satisfied
 But the things that my brothers try to do to their brains
 The thought makes my blood begin to boil in my veins
 But it's a case of ""We want it right when we want it""
 They can't be satisfied
 Gangrene, dying one inch at a time
 Gangrene, sell your freedom by minutes
 Flesh by the pound
 I got a mind of my own and I need to enjoy
 Something that the mercenaries can't destroy
 I don't know where to find it but 'til I get it
 I can't be satisfied
 So we take to the road like a thief on the run
 Regroup underground and find our own kind of fun
 But seems whenever we find it
 Somebody buys it
 We can't be satisfied
 Gangrene, dying one inch at a time
 Gangrene, that's all the vampires leave behind
 Fifty million kids with nothing better to do
 Than sit around like a zombie and stare at the tube
 They'll sap your strength and suck your soul and
 Feed you their trash
 'Til your mind is left blank
 And your dreams have been smashed",Gangrene,1977
Utopia,"No place to hide
 And no where to run
 Nothing you can do because a change must come
 You can't stop it
 You got your tail in the air
 Your head in the ground
 Money, money, money makes your world go 'round
 You see
 You can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop
 You can't stop love in action
 You just joined the clan
 Your head's full of sand
 You need a bunch of friends to make you feel like a man
 But you can't stop it
 Yeah, you could be the last trace of the master race
 The Nazis really send you to another place
 Still you can't stop it
 You can't stop love in action",Love in Action,1977
Utopia,"Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a short cut I'd have found it
But there's no easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads and walk on by
Tell me, is it worth just another try?

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer (let it shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer (you know the answer is love)

Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?
What are the chances?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers

And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
When you're all alone, love one another
When you're far from home, love one another
When you're down and out, love one another
All your hope's run out, love one another
When you need a friend, love one another
When you're near the end, love
We got to love, we got to love one another

Light of the world, you got to shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all (know that love can save the day)
Set us free

Utopia,"I don't know the reason why I seem to need a release
I can't stand to beg for favors like a child on his knees
But I won't go on a minute 'til I get me some peace
On the road to Armageddon

I done things I'd be ashamed to see in black and white
There are times I miss distinctions over wrong and right
But I'm gonna get an answer when I get there tonight
On the road to Armageddon

It's the wrong world
I must be on the wrong planet
I been checkin' it out
And I know what it's all about

Mr. and Mrs. Universe
In their cabin in the sky
She's a little bit of heaven
He's one hell of a guy

And like all suburban couples they may have a spat
But that is that
It's back to normal
And it's your night to feed the cat

Let us raise a glass
And we'll drink a toast
And the devil will dance
With the Holy Ghost

The strong and frail
They will all join hands
At the end of the world",The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,1977
Utopia,"Walk the line
 It's not easy
 I must stand alone
 It's the kind of a life I've chosen
 Right or wrong
 I can feel
 Near me always
 Something to live up to
 Someone to depend upon
 When I have fallen from grace
 When I grow weak from the pace
 I can feel the breath of gentle wings on my face
 And when the world closes in around me
 Then my angel
 Will come and roll away the stone
 Like a hand reaching down from the heavens
 And when the darkness falls all around me
 Then my angel
 Will come and draw aside the veil
 I am safe in the arms of my angel
 Anywhere
 Anytime
 In my mind I know
 That a pair of sweet eyes is watching me
 Wherever I go
 Is it real?
 Am I dreaming?
 Sometimes I don't know
 But I want to believe it's so
 Let me dream on
 Is it profane or divine
 Am I insane? I feel fine
 I can close my eyes but I still see it shine",My Angel,1977

 Won't you have pity
 Won't you have pity on the guiltless ones
 Hey Mister Chrysler

 Who gives a damn for tomorrow's children
 Pay no mind, you just keep on takin'
 Keep on takin' 'til there's nothing at all
 Sit on your hands and don't say nothin'
 Cover your eyes, you won't see nothin'

 Shed a tear for the one's waiting at the door

Utopia,"Brother John saw visions of God
 So they put him in chains
 For acting too odd
 As the crowd shouted, ""Off with his head""
 The priest said, ""Have mercy
 Let's burn him instead""
 Trapped
 Trapped in a world that he never made
 I woke up with my head on the floor
 In a windowless cell
 A room full of doors
 I got lost, now I'm so far behind
 Took so much advice
 Forgot my own mind
 Trapped
 Trapped in a world that I never made
 We can't be slowed down by a big bunch of lip
 And nobody cares about your paranoid trip
 You know death and the devil sure got it easy today
 Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away
 You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive
 What makes you think that the weak survive
 And if you don't have the stomach
 For all this radical crap
 Then have the guts to stand for something
 Or you're gonna be trapped

 Trapped in a world that you never made",Trapped,1977
Utopia,"You took that last corner too fast
 Careened up against the side wall
 For a moment everything went black
 Woke up inside somebody else's hideaway in a distant place
 Don't know your name or know this face
 And what you don't know hurts you so
 It can only be that way
 Feel yourself becoming someone else
 We may yet see that light at the end of the tunnel
 If we can find a way to keep things under control
 The web of life connects each of us to the other
 So it's no use pretending that you alone run the show
 Just like a moth too close to the fire explodes
 Though the myth is exposed

The one I admire, my simple desire
Smothered by a love gone green

Must be jealousy, must be cause it sounds like
Jealousy, must be 'cause it looks like
Jealousy, must be 'cause it smells like
Jealousy, must be 'cause it feels like
Eyes are drilling holes in the back of your head
Someone's got the number of your death bed, stepping into

Jealousy
You're ready for a comeback
You're back on your feet again
You think you're out from under
You hear a crack of thunder
Someone stabs you with a poison pen

If you try fightin' dirty
Just try to keep it clean
Cause no amount of trying and no amount of crying

Now it begins, strike up the band
Bring on the dancing girls and the freak parade

Look to your right where a gentleman sat
There sits a monkey in a tall silk hat

I thought as a child
I spoke as a child
I didn't know better

But now I'm a man
I look like a man
I'm old as a man
And I should know better

Got my head in the sky
And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down
And my world is something you can't see

But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man

I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better

And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on

It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now [ha ha ha]

But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong

Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin'
""Oh my God""
There it is - way down inside me
It's a real man

You got to grow up sometime
Be a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows
Be a real man

Now be a real man
Don't sell yourself for nothing
Be a real man
Don't take no crap from no one

Be a real man
Get your trip together
Be a real man",Real Man,1978
Utopia,"Some people tell me that love is a feeling

Do they spend some money?
Say something funny,
Ask for some tenderness?

Stand on your head,

The more you talk about it
Is it anymore real

If you jump around and shout it
I'm sick and tired of hearing
'bout everyone without it and
Too much talkin' sends me walkin'

Night is falling and everybody's calling for love
Everybody's lookin' for their one and only
It's only just a game 'cause they're scared to be lonely

Utopia,"Shot In The Dark Lyrics
Everyday it's the same old situation
I face the same old line of empty faces
Sit at my desk while the clock counts up my wages

Pick up my pay every Friday and take off like a
Shot in the dark
I took off like a shot in the dark
I split the scene like a shot in the dark

Ain't got no target, don't aim for no mark
'Cause I'm off like a shot in the dark
It was only a game when we first started
The novelty wore away and the fun departed

I can't live up anymore to those things I spouted
And if you say you feel the same way
I'll be off like a
Shot in the dark

There's no changes going down
There's no lesson to be found
Makes no sense to hang around
If that's all there is to that

(That's what she said)
Someone just tossed a bomb through
Kitchen window
And in the middle of a shoo-fly pie

Mama took off like a
Bat out of hell

 Will you lend me your ear
 Do you know the meaning of emptiness

 Let me tell you a story
 One you've probably heard
One about the man who was lost
 And I can tell you in one word
 Alone, alone
 Nobody knows how lonely it can be
 And he was tired of being alone
 Alone, alone

I've been listening to what's been going down

Been waiting so long, waiting so long

Shining still, to give us the will
Bright as the day, to show us the way
Somehow, someday
We need just one victory and we're on our way

We've been prayin' for it all day
And we're fightin' for it all night
To give us just one victory, it will be all right
We may feel about to fall but we go down fighting

You will hear the call if you only listen
Underneath it all we are here together
Shining still, to give us the will
Now bright as the day, to show us the way

Hold that line, baby hold that line
Get up boys and hit 'em one more time
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying

 Will be the first of the new age masters
 Pick up your arms was the call
 So I packed up my Fender and ran down the hall
 Back to the fields and forests
 Now I am one of them

And the hum of the amps shook the trees and the ground
 And like a single man we cranked up the knobs
 And a thousand guitars sang our national anthem
 We captured the whole human race
 There was nowhere to hide, playing filled every space
 Jamming the world back into place
 Everyone a star
 We hit the supreme overload
 And the great amplifier began to explode

 And the whole universe is a giant guitar

 I didn't ask to know
 But now I'm compensating as I go
 I know the script I'm in
 I'm only thoughts of heaven trapped in flesh and skin
 And from the world of men
 I try to tighten up the code again
 And the code is a play
 A play is a song
 A song is a film
 A film is a dance
 Boot me up on the Zen Machine
Log me onto the Zen Machine
 Load me down
 Everybody get ready
 Hook me into the Zen Machine
 Sharing time on the Zen Machine
 Load me up
 Everybody get ready
 Sometimes it's clear to me
 Then for a moment I'm in timeless ecstasy
 There are no reasons why
 And everyone's a passer-by
 But when they've gone to bed
 A fire's burning on the screen and in my head
 And on a windy day
 You can smell it from a mile away
 And the smell is a note
 A note is a taste
 A taste is a hue
 A hue is a touch",Zen Machine,1996
Utopia,"Second Nature Lyrics
Something tells me when something's wrong
Seems like it's been such a long,
Long time since I felt that one

You have your ways and I have my ways
And like the back of my hand I know it
And I don't have to try to make you show it
You don't have to show me how

'Cause it's second nature to me now
Something's taken hold of me somehow
'Cause it's second nature to me now

Nobody must explain to me your way of communication
Give me the time to understand
I always come around
I have my ways and you have your ways

And we need no elaboration
We can just enjoy that sweet sensation",Second Nature,1999
Utopia,"My great grandfather was a satisfied man
Contented in every way
Such was the course of his everyday life
'Til he heard of the seven rays (Repeat 3X)

Every modern man, in the back of his mind
Has a problem to face
He wants security for the home in his head
All he needs is the seven rays (Repeat 2X)

And when you think about tomorrow
What goes through your mind?
Now don't nobody get uptight
Do you think that we can put up
With this shit one more night
All you need is just six more rays (Repeat 2X)

Take one beam of light
Prism acquire
Break the white light down
Seven rays appear (Repeat)

One, Red, the ruler seeking freedom
Two, Gold, the father seeking unity
Three, Orange, the thinker seeking understanding
Four, Yellow, the poet seeking harmony

Take the seven rays
Pure as fire
Focus anywhere
White light will appear (Repeat 2X)

Five, Green, the scientist seeking truth
Six, Blue, the disciple seeking goodness
Seven, Indigo, the artist seeking beauty

This may sound like a bunch of trumped up words
But we keep no secrets today
The only hope for you is in your brothers, my friend
All you need is just six more rays
All we need is the seven rays (Repeat 3X)",The Seven Rays,1999

Uusi Fantasia,"Visions of you or pictures in tabloids
I've seen no way out since I was a boy
Hold on to something that I know is near
Feeling much closer to holding my tears

Banter that shoots me through cannons and spillways
Forests and nights as I walk through these hallways
Kaleidoscopes eyes of killers come near
Feeling less desperate to hold in my fear

I need your love

Visions of you or pictures in tabloids
I've seen no way out since I was a boy
Hold on to something that I know is near
Missing the point as I fall through these years

I need your love

Uusi Fantasia,"Yötä tuijotellen yksin valvon 
On levottomuus vallannut kallon 
Pyörin paikallani, päätä raavin 
Pimeydeltä mä vastausta vaadin 
Aloin ääniä seinissä pelkää 
Hiljaisuutta kakskyt yli neljä 
Kun olin ääniin tottumassa 
Tiesin että aika on loppumassa 
Kun kuulin siitä, oli liian myöhä 
Oli järki mennyt syksyn myötä 
Mitä voin odottaa elämältä 
Kun jyskyttää aivois pitkin yötä 
Kun kuulin siitä, oli liian myöhä 
Oli kaikki mennyt lehtien myötä 
Mitä voin odottaa elämältä 
Kun vuoden kuluttua pääsen täältä 

Enää seinät seiniä ei oo 
Päivät juoksee, mun aika seisoo 
Odotushuoneessa nimeni kuulin 
Vanha mies taas aloittaa kuurin 
Kädet mullassa syksyn jaksoin 
Toisella asteella kalpein kasvoin 
Nyt apteekista pelastuksen noudan 
Nuori tyttö lyö pillerit kouraan 
Kun kuulin siitä, oli liian myöhä 
Oli järki mennyt syksyn myötä 
Mitä voin odottaa elämältä 
Kun jyskyttää aivois pitkin yötä 
Kun kuulin siitä, oli liian myöhä 
Oli kaikki mennyt lehtien myötä

With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Of an uncertain hue
And the chances I thought I'd had

There were devils bearing gifts
And angels on the piss

For my sins I will confess
And I will never lie
There's nobody that was ever here

And I've lived my life the best
Every second to defy

Like a wave crashing in to the shore, you wash away my dreams.
 
Time, why you walk away?
Like a friend with somewhere to go, you left me cryin'.
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow and all the pain and sorrow, runnin' free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day and I don't believe in time.
 
Time, I don't understand.
Children killin' in the street, dyin' for the color of a rag.
 
Time, take their red and blue.
Wash them in the ocean, make them clean.
Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight.
 
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow and all the pain and sorrow, runnin' free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day and I don't believe in

You ain't no friend of mine.
I don't know where I'm going.
I think I'm out of my mind, thinkin' about time.
 
Time, you left me standin' there, like a tree growin' all alone.
The wind just stripped me bare, stripped me bare.
 
Time, the past has come and gone.
The future's far away.
Well, now only lasts for one second, one second.
 
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow and all the pain and sorrow, runnin' free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day and I don't believe in

V Apicella,"C'est à travers de larges grilles,
Que les femelles du canton,
Contemplaient un puissant gorille,
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on.
Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu de nommer ici...
Gare au gorille !...

Tout à coup la prison bien close
Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre, on n'sait pourquoi. Je suppose
Qu'on avait du la fermer mal.
Le singe, en sortant de sa cage
Dit ""C'est aujourd'hui que j'le perds !""
Il parlait de son pucelage,
Vous aviez deviné, j'espère !
Gare au gorille !...

L'patron de la ménagerie
Criait, éperdu : ""Nom de nom !
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon !""
Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau,
Au lieu de profiter de la chance,
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux !
Gare au gorille !...

Celles là même qui, naguère,
Le couvaient d'un il décidé,
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées ;
D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte,
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte,
Bien des femmes vous le diront !
Gare au gorille !...

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut,
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut;
Voyant que toutes se dérobent,
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vieille et du magistrat !
Gare au gorille !...

""Bah ! soupirait la centenaire,
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer,
Ce serait extraordinaire,
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré !"" ;
Le juge pensait, impassible,
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon,
C'est complètement impossible...""
La suite lui prouva que non !
Gare au gorille !...

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être,
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre,
Lequel choisirait-il des deux ?
Qu'une alternative pareille,
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie,
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vieille
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix !
Gare au gorille !...

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix,
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit.
Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vieille,
Comme l'aurait fait n'importe qui,
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis !
Gare au gorille !...

La suite serait délectable,
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable,
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu ;
Car le juge, au moment suprême,
Criait : ""Maman !"", pleurait beaucoup,
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même,
Il avait fait trancher le cou.
Gare au gorille !...",Le Gorille,2000

All I see is hate, (Fuck you what you want to do huh?)
All I see is hate, (Fuck me, well fuck you too)
All I see is hate, (psycho-fanatic, your mind is an addict)
All I see is hate, (Don't give a fuck, why cause I've had it)

Black Sunday, on the day I hate breed
Jesus paid and now we're all gonna bleed
Dirty deeds and their done dirt cheap
Now they creep through the streets
While you weep in your sleep
From Miami to LA, New York and back
It's like a pimp slap, from a bum on crack
and then you you got jacked like Lindros on his back
In fact, you lack, your intelligence is wack
Stop the hate, it ain't too late
The devil'll take your soul unless you step up to the plate
Spreading the hate, now you're sealing your fate
Take a look up in the mirror and face what you create

My path lies beneath your eyes
My path lies beneath your eyes
My path lies beneath your eyes

[Chorus:]",Hate,2001
V-Ice,"[Verse 1]
I know something's shady when I'm feeling it
You play the game like cards when you're dealing it
I see through the eyes of a marked man
But in the streets, you gotta have a game plan
I'm paranoid, I see them coming after me
24/7 on me constantly
I see the red beam, I walk a tight rope
But I know, I'm the target in the scope! Yea!
I try to weed out the real from the fake ones
Two faced ones, won't you keep it real son
I can see it from a mile away
Cause I'm holding it down with my feet on the ground
And they

[Bridge] 
They're trying to break me, They're trying to rape me
They're trying to bring me down
They're trying to break me, They're trying to rape me
They're trying to bring me down

[Chorus] 
I know there's something going on (and it seems so cold)
I know there's something going on (and it won't be long)
I know there's something going on (how could you be so cold)
I know there's something going wrong! yea!

[Verse 2]
Evil lurks when you look around
And then you know how it's going down
I look deep and figure how to break free
In my plan, escape from reality
I see you scoping on my life and now he tells me
You look suspicious and your plan is trying to gank me
The main suspect but you're the reject
You'll be the one with the gun, no respect for me
I roll deep like Bond, I got a blueprint
Creep in your area, low right through the residence
Like a sniper, control the damager
Flipping the script, cause I'm two steps ahead of ya

Cars on top of cars I'ma call it whip appeal, bitch
Whip appeal, bitch
Whip appeal, bitch
Cars on top of cars I'ma call it whip appeal, bitch

No I'm not a scholar
I'm drinking out the bottle
Only fuck with models
If she ain't dead fine than there ain't no need to holler
Yeah, I'm a baller
My swag through the roof
And your girlfriend is the truth
We got a room at the Ramada
She don't want to be bothered
You callin' like a father
You actin' like a toddler
You need a role model
I'm Polo with the Prada
I'm balling on you niggas like a Harlem Glodetrotter
I'm walking with a waddle
You make believe niggas Harry Potter
Amigo friends might recommend the whole enchilada
Your girlfriend is a quitter
You should spit or you saliva
I'm Gucci Mane the mobster
Not a jocker, not a blogger

[Chorus]

Gucci let's get 'em
Got that AR chopper
Come through the front door
Left them at the doctor
Now we up a hundred more bands, that's proper
No need for a preacher
Pray to me, I'll be your father
Hide the young ones cause I'm coming for your daughter
If you ain't selling pussy, I ain't gon' bother
Got a pornstar, a ho, and a model
In the club we do big shit
Pop a hundred bottles
We gettin' hoes wet
They gon' need goggles
They said get that gas
So I'm on that full throttle
If I had a dick, than I'd tell that bitch to swallow
Thirty in my clip and I'm letting out hallows

[Chorus]

LA Raiders
Bo Jackson
Making love to the money
Oh I'm so passionate
Hood stripes, Chuck Taylors, low khakis
Scraping in that new V looking V-Nasty
Selling snow in the winter I ain't cold yet
That's why I'm an OG and I ain't Old yet
South Central Murder Dubs, Killer California
Bend the wrong corner
You'll be sicker than pneumonia
Police told me to freeze
And my watch to chill
Whip the work into a SLS
Whip Appeal
Powder so fresh, I had to break the seal
96 and Wall Street
Shit gets real

I really think I'm feelin' you
Especially when you shinin' those beams like you do
Grab one beer

And

A bitch or maybe two
And hit the sand in the water so I get cool
I see a little lady walkin' with her cheeks out
Gotta pull her by her arm and see what she's about
Can we go to Hawaii so you can roll my blunts when

I get too high
She's young and fun and the sun's here with her
She's kinda cute but the bitch is gettin' weirder
I'm gonna roll her in a ball and just kick her
Can't believe she pulled that

Shit at dinner
Bitch I'm done like the sun on the east side
Kreayshawn again bounce out the G ride
Grab a burger and a chopper then I get to slide
I think I'm gonna leave her now 'cause it's summertime

Turn up, smoke up and hit the waterslide
Keep cool 'cause you know it's too hot to bite
When it's hot out, you know the whole blocks out
Girl you're gonna get your turn, please don't start to pout
Puerto Rican Parade in the MA

And

We feelin' great because the sun's rays
Drink water 'cause I need to snap out of it
They say the summertime, known the season of the hits
So here's a hit, go and pass it on to all your friends

Slap it real loud when you're drivin' the Benz
You be partyin' no need to pretend

Candy weist, planting colors like new ports
Hot nights on the block like I'm in a fort
July comes poppin' bitches like it's the fourth
It's summertime and your bitch is on my line though
She keeps calling me, she ain't on my mind though
Summertime, I'll be damned if I die broke

{ Out 24/7 chasing my dough }
Water fights in the hood at the barbecue
Hate to buy a lot but I only trust a few
My type, ice cold, drinking like juice
Chin up, chase it down with the grey goose
Bitches trippin' on the bitch when they hear my name
Sippin' Ciroc, connecting blunts to the flames
I'm seein' new things but I can't change
Summertime when a bitch like me will snatch ya chain

We were teenagers

We were cold and all alone

Tell me baby all through the night
That you'll never let me go
Tell me baby cause I want the world to know

Together we were one
We found the place where dreams are made
And hearts never broken
We said we'd never leave
You know we couldn't turn around
And face what we had left behind

We were young in love
Out on the run
We were cold and all alone

Tell me baby cause I want the world to know

Va cabalgando un jinete
Vaga solito en el mundo
Y va deseando la muerte.

Va con su alma destrozada
Quisiera perder la vida
Y reunirse con su amada.

La quería mas que a su vida
Y la perdió para siempre
Por eso lleva una herida
Por eso busca la muerte.

Con su guitarra cantando
Se pasa noches enteras

A la luz de las estrellas.

Que se lo lleve con ella.

V. Rose,"I need you to imagine how they whipped Him
How they beat Him they opened up His back with every lash and tore off pieces
The place He stood was slick from all the blood that He was bleeding
He could have stayed right there as if He was defeated
But no
He knew that no one else could save the world
They need Him
And so He took the form of wretched man they called Him Jesus
He left His throne in Heaven
Then Satan had deceived them
He had to go to earth and trade His life to win our freedom oh

I close my eyes and see Him
All of His life depleted
Hanging upon a tree with nails put through His hands and feet and
I know that I'm the reason
Because of my constant treason
It was my own complete sin
That caused this awful treatment
But one day I'm going to meet Him
I'll fall on my face when I see Him
Thank Him for all that He did
I'll be free then

And when I do see Jesus
I won't ask Him why we die
I won't ask Him to explain the planets
I'll be spending all my time
Crying holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, 
Holy, holy, holy.

And when I do see Jesus
I would love to pick His brain
Like how'd it feel to die and live again but I'll be too busy crying holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy

And when I do see Jesus
I will cry a million tears

Tak ingin lagi ku lihat wajah mu di hadapan ku

Takkan ku merayu sayang…tak ingin aku membuat mcm ini lagi

V.I.A. Gra,"No I didn't trust him
But he rushed me to feel
Tried me mesmerize to me
With his all sex appeal

Told me everything
That I was longing to hear
Shine and handsome
My souvenir

And then all of sudden
I have fallen in love
He would put me down
But I'll still place him above

Tired of searching for the love
That still lives in him
Given my everything
Like a souvenir

Given up my heart
In the name of the memory
Fallen down like rain
He could feel every drop

Now I know I have
Have the courage to tell him
Tell him to stop!stop!stop!

Fallen down like rain

I melt away at night
Dreams for once so colorful
Become black and white

Loving once so wonderful
Is no longer here
So I'll keep this feeling

Oh yeah, oh yeah! ohh baby
Oh ohh, oh ohh, oh baby, oh yeah..

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like ""where?""
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you like I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do

[Chorus - Mario Winans]
You're so special, you're the one
But you're already ta-ken
Oh I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I'm having the time of my life
Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen homegirly just flossin, we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin, me never
You and be	-l-a-see-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Häagen-Dazs, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

[Chorus]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I couldn't leave well enough alone
Hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, ""I love you, mmmuah!""
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power, dedicate songs every hour
All hell done broke loose
He got your passcode to your cell and my Nextel shirt too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your ride?

Bigboy, get bagged, he gon' hold my bail
It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage

Shuttering since expression stole the key to my soul
Struggling since victory presumed control
Battling since the truth infiltrated my mold
Seeking to kind a life in invisible hold
Traveling down a path of a difficult road
Running without a clue of being left astray
Swearing I'm getting closer but really further away

Examine things in life you hate but you've become get sick of yourself

Strong enougfh to wait for the when to weaken the now

How do you account for the platinum rappers with millions of record sales 
Then tell me I ain't good 'cause my record fails

Keeps driving thoughts to the pole
The fields of silence from my soul
Chilled neon blood in my mouth
The black clock makes tours of time
As I spend my days between the stations

Sometimes believing in some disembodied being can help find the way in the
World.
A being that constitutes an essence of what you profess and follow.
A being that exist only in your dreams and never falls prey to sestemic
Arrangments of religions and philosophies.

I am the Left Hand of Darkness
I am the Right Hand of Light
I am the Lurker of the Twilight
I am the Mist of the Dawn

As you are dreaming me up
I'm bringing freedom into your mind

I am the Sadness of the Gods
I am the Radiance from the Sky
I am the Desert of the Real
I am the Knowledge and the Maze

I am the Lizard without the King
I am Fall without the Leap
I am the Power without the Might
I am the Wanderer without the Road

Protect your daemon, I said
Before the magic lamb shatters
Protect your deities, I said
Before I come to bring them down

I just don't know why I have a pair of wings
You come to me and ask for help
You urge me to unleash my wrath
You cry and yell and bag and pray
You chant some words I don't understand
Is it 'cause I have a pair of wings?

The fall that never happened
Over and over you kill the same god
Whose name I don't even know
Would you do the same
If I shed my pair of wings?

- the only real difference is how long we have to and wish to stay there.

Nothing ever opens
Nothing ever brightens
Nothing ever changes

No gods to be served
No light to be searched
No triumph of love and will

Everything is painful
Everything is stained
Everything's slow cold shock

I strive and fail
I shiver and moan
And keep telling myself this is not a world of hurt

We're all small and petty
We all crave for dreams
We all watch and lie
We're all blunt and lost

In Hell three lakes: of burning tar, of vermin and of ice- all brimming with sinners
And Devils larger then Daemons with horns made of fire

Then I see heaven on the second mountain
The city of gold and honey with saints...
All joyful and towering in their glory

There I see two pious and innocent youths snatched suddenly
From amidst their host by flying Devils and carried to Hell
While Uzza, one of Four guardians of Egypt and angels pay no heed to this rape

The Aeons go past and the plagues get unleashed
The city of good is under siege

Black Moses is my name
And these are the visions
From Egypt's guardian seraph...

The heaven is on fire and Salomon's magic nets give no protection
St. Peter's shot and jesus with his brothers are slaughtered with no mercy
Their blood into dust without meaning of rebirth

And I see the gates to god tumbling down
And him being dragged before Abaddon's gold throne
Where the Grand Whore Barbelo's daughter wields a double-edged axe

And I see the blade fall down upon the head of lord in heaven
And Darkness falls upon the end of history
While I drink the milk of the Black Goddess and cry over the mankind

Black Moses is my name...

Hold up, let the Slime spit 
Need these first three rows, let my suave sit 
Icy, make it hard to see the time tick

In the hood where I creep trying to hook me a freak 
Want to see what girl around here come put me to sleep 
Could mean a hotel, could mean a suite 
Could mean tuition, could mean a Jeep!

Jump out of Lambos 
Car, neck, hand froze 
Damn, yo! Cameras, stand, pose 
Therefore, watch her 'fore Cam rose 

She got down, I'm tryna' get the top 
Me, Lee brick and chop 
How to hit the block, eee wee piffing rock

When I was starving that was payback

But I feel that hate
When I got that ? I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug, you ain't gon' wake

Always smoking a ounce, a mountain, no tens on it
Spins on it, you have no clout, the Benz on it

It was a long march from cadets
The sixth battalion was the next to tour and it was me who drew the card
We did Canungra and Shoalwater before we left

This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean
And there's me in me slouch hat with me SLR and greens
God help me 
I was only nineteen

From Vung Tau riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
And we made our tents a home, V.B. and pinups on the lockers
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And night time's just a jungle dark and a barking M.16?
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me
I was only nineteen

A four week operation, when each step can mean your last one on two legs
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought about somethin' else

And then someone yelled out contact, and the bloke behind me swore
We hooked in there for hours, then a God almighty roar
And Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon
God help me 
He was goin' home in June

And I can still see Frankie, drinkin' tinnies in the Grand Hotel
On a thirty-six hour rec. leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle
'Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row

And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel
God help me 
I was only nineteen

But you came home and threw a stay-behind party to try to clear up the mess.

I'm down here in a fire-fightâ?¦
But wherever you are, I hope you're safe behind the wire.

We were fighting for freedom in South East Asia - that's how the story ranâ?¦

of this lonely pilgrim land
Raising strong and mighty fortresses 
that I alone command
But these castles 
I've constructed by the 
strength of my own hand
Are just temporary kingdoms 
on foundations made of sand

In the middle of the battle 
I believe I've finally found
I'll never know the thrill of victory 
'til I'm willing to lay down
All my weapons of defense and 
earthly strategies of war
So I'm laying down my arms and 
running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition 
is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on 
a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision 
is the status I attain
My accomplishments are 
worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies 
to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow 
to use the life I willingly lay down
I surrender all the triumph for 
it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, 
I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, 
and all I've known 
Now belongs to You, 
the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac 
on the sacraficial fire

Vains of Jenna,"All those lines i've written, are they really true?
Are those scribbled lines, how i felt for you?
Emotions became lust when i tasted fame
I can't hold back, i'm just playing the game

I still got the fire, but there's nothing to regret
I am what i am, and i'm never gonna change

You're bound to get burned if you're uner my sun

Vajra,"We're going to begin to act
Beginning, today
To do whatever needs to be done
Let's get on with the job!

World has turned over many times
And it transformed the history of men
In the will or the skill to fight
We're ready to take part
But now further direction is required
Tonight a battle has been join
We will not fail
Regrettably, we know believe that only force will make them live.

I just wanna say this right now
That regardless of what they say about it
There's nothing new, only different!
Never forget this, the future is to those who take it
All I say is that noting is easy, and the best things are the hardest.

That isn't enough, it is madness!

Some men see things as they are and say why?
I dream things that never were and say why not.

Epic battle has ended,
Thank you, good night and farewell.",Le Banquet,2012

Empezar en Boca Chica y terminar en La Romana 
Hechado pa' trás, bebiendo mamajuana

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun

But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Seeking your face when I discovered
My life was no longer my own, but yours
Then I heard you say, ""Go and tell them
To open your heart, let me in and I will supply your every need.""
Then I cried, ""Lord, I don't know if I can do it.""
""You will find your strength in me. Only believe.""
Then I said, ""What if I fail? I just couldn't take it""
He said, ""I have given you my ability.""

For the sake of the call
I am laying down my all
No turning back
Moving straight ahead
I'm on the right track
And it's all for the sake of the call

Brother, leave doubt behind, stay your part
Know that he's with you, yes, he's there all the time

Through Him you can do most anything

You might say, ""What if I fail? I just couldn't take it.""

Val Doonican,"Now Delaney had a donkey that everyone admired
Temporarily lazy and permanently tired
A leg at every corner balancing his head
And a tail to let you know which end he wanted to be fed

Riley slyly said we've underrated it 
Why not train it, then they took a rag?
They rubbed it, scrubbed it, they oiled and embrocated it
Got it at the post and when the starter dropped the flag

There was Riley pushin' it, shovin' it, shushin' it
Hogan, Logan and everyone in town
Lined up, attackin' it and shovin' it and smackin' it
They might as well have tried to push the town hall down

The donkey was eyein' them, openly defyin' them
Winkin', blinkin' and twistin' out of place
Riley reversin' it, everybody cursin' it
The day Delaney's donkey ran the half mile race

The muscles of the mighty never known to flinch
They couldn't move the donkey a quarter of an inch
Delaney lay exhausted, hangin' round his throat
With a grip just like a Scotsman on the five pound note

Starter, Carter, he lined up with the rest of them
When it saw them, it was willin' then
It raced up, braced up, ready for the best of them
They started off to cheer it but it changed its mind again

And there was Riley pushin' it, shovin' it, shushin' it
Hogan, Logan and Mary Ann Macgraw
She started pokin' it an' grabbin' it an' chokin' it
It kicked her in the bustle and it laughed hee-hah

The whigs and conservatives, the radical superlatives
Liberals and tories, they hurried to the place
Stood there in unity, helpin' the community
The day Delaney's donkey ran the halfmile race

The crowd began to cheer it, then Rafferty, the judge
He came up to assist them, but still it wouldn't bud
And the jockey who was riding, little John MacGee
Was so thoroughly disgusted that he went to have his tea

Hagan, Fagan was students of psychology
Swore they'd shift it with some dynamite
They bought it, brought it, then without apology
The donkey gave a sneeze and blew the darn stuff out of sight

There was Riley pushing it, shoving it and shushing it
Hogan, Logan and all the bally crew
Police, and auxiliary  
The Garrison Artillery
The Second Enniskillen's and the life guards too

They seized it and harried it
They picked it up and carried it
Cheered it, steered it to the winning place

Then the Bookies drew aside,
They all commited suicide
The day Delaney's donkey won the half mile race",Delaney's Donkey,2001
Val Doonican,"You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Val Doonican,"Here in this room, this narrow room where life began when we were young last night
I feel your back pressed close to me and hear your steady breathing as you sleep
There's the first soft glow of dawn, the silver grey light played along the wall
I touch your hand and feel your ring and know that this is all we'll ever have

Suddenly I look into your sleepy eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there
Then I feel your fingers running through my mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there

I know so well that this is all there is and when we leave this room it's gone
My mind despairs as we walk down the crooked little steps to the front door
A ray of sun that ricochets from off the rooftop lights our way
I touch your hand and feel your ring and know
that this is all we'll ever have",Morning,2001
Val Doonican,"Children are people who live in a land 
Made of raindrops and puddles and pebbles and streams
Silently watching a twig as it sails 
On a clear crystal pool to an island of dreams

There go a pair who have just built a city of mud 
And it's real
They know that mud doesn't look very pretty
But ooh, how it feels

This little boy greets the snow with a smile
That little girl has discovered an isle made out of pillows
One little fellow is friends with the wind in the willows
All of them children and all are mysterious people

I can remember when I was a boy 
That my bed was a ship that I sailed through the night
And I remember the world as a place 
That was eager and loving and shiny and bright

Where is the boy who was friends with the rainbow 
And once rode upon
Where is that shy and mysterious person
Oh where have I gone

I can remember I once said my prayers
But now I stand by while my children say theirs
Watching them kneeling
And I could cry that one day they'll forget

Leaving my old life behind,
And I came to a place where a ring of bright water,
Dazzled all cares from my mind.

So I live with the wonder of the sky and the sea
And I'll always remember who revealed them to me

Leading me down to the sea
But I'll always smile when a ring of bright water
Echoes your laughter to me.

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

They're all wearing bustles like their mothers used to do
They each wear a bolster beneath the petticoat
And leave the rest to providence and Paddy McGinty's goat

He'd long wiry whiskers a' hanging from his chin""

She came back with powder and paint upon her face
She'd rings on her fingers, and she wore a sable coat
And I'll bet your life she didn't get those from Paddy McGinty's goat

Now Norah McCarthy the knot was going to tie
She washed out her trousseau and hung it out to dry
Along came the goat and he saw the bits of white
And chewed up all her falderals, and on her wedding night

""Oh turn out the light quick!"" she shouted out to Pat

He held up the note, shouting ""look at what I've got""
The goat came up and grabbed at it and swallowed all the lot

""He's eaten me banknote,"" said Mickey, with the hump
They went for the doctor and they got a stomach pump
They pumped and they pumped for that twenty dollar note
But all they got was ninepence out of Paddy McGinty's goat

Now old Paddy's goat had a wonderous appetite
And one day for breakfast he ate some dynamite
A big box of matches he swallowed all serene
And out he went and swallowed up a quarter paraffin

He sat by the fireside, he didn't give a hang
He swallowed a spark and exploded with a bang
So if you go to heaven you can bet a dollar note
That the angel with the whiskers on is Paddy McGinty's goat",Paddy McGinty's Goat,2008

Take care of your Personal Business
Don't let the game get you and drive you insane

This here life of mine down this one way street
So unpredictable, tryin' to run into a Dollar
Drama all I seem to get into, can't rewind time
So the problems that's mine, is either solve 'em
Or deal with 'em tomorrow, can't borrow, ain't got a job
Money ain't circulatin', cops had the spot dropped
So it ain't no work in yay, What's up?
I'm thinkin' 'Damn, I need a Dollar'
I feel stuck and the hard times make me want to holla
God help me out here, oh no I'm with my last
Knowin' I can be the next to die, gone with the pass that
I don't want to feel like real life's hard to live
Fake 'cause when they do me, ay, this ain't no movie
Ain't no take too, you ever think about where your
Life goin' take you? ain't you grateful to be alive
Or you want to die 'cause life hates you, don't let it take you
Or make you or break you

And you get broke with no hope and, no get back
Let's try hard to see success and not the stress and get there
You stay persistent long enough, you probably have shit where
Everything you need'll be exactly where it need to be
 
To me the streets and peace are never seen in 
See really forgot about the kids doin' what we did
Part of gettin' high watchin' time go by
Now they want to smoke and drink and ride on by
Catch a case, be at their pace and it's a long cold ride
Judge just gave Shorty Mack 1-0-5 and I doubt he'll live
To be a hundred and thirty three, they try to tellin' me he gon' die
Yo, in the penitentiary, he mentioned he needed me to send him a 
Package, I'ma shoot it to ya, man I know the game'll do it to ya
Yes it will like that, like that

[Verse 3]
For me, it's been a long time comin' with a stretch up in here
I ain't scared but I don't want to be dead
I caught the game tryin' to kill me and found out it's been
Several attempts, it hurts to know this shit gettin' so personal
At once, don't they know you can't do nothin' about it
Least you know the world'll never be crowded
The same thing that'll make you laugh'll make you cry
The same game that got you rich will make you die

I need nickels and dimes would I be sent and life be as a

If you ain't got no dough, Nah I ain't tellin' and try to go
And try to sell your brain, if you ain't got you a scale
And a barreler cane, I'm just sayin' got to use what you got
To, do what you want and most folks don't

Val Young,"Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

They tell me that temptation, ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, I tried to hide my feelings, d-o-g's
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby, won't you be there when it's hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

I've traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing I really want you to do

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real g's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But what's the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be macking
I can't lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, ok
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on the phone

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone",Never Leave Me Alone,1998

She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I turned to her, and say that I'm
infatuated, concentrated on cuttin it up
Body bustin out your blouse, don't button it up
Me and you could make a getaway, up in the cut
I'm just a squirrel in your world, bustin a nut
Slide in the passenger side and creep to the tilt
And maybe you could get a chance to sleep on my silk
because you come with, that A-1 shit
The kind I wouldn't mind havin a 20-year run with
I'm done with these games, played by these dames
I could exit the drama the same way that I came
'cause I gotta put it down for my sons
so you, skanless scuds gets none of my funds
'cause I can't be in love with my pockets on fee
Get the money, the power and the rest come for free, you know

in a Rolls, Royce? Make it real moist
Take the Rolls to the jet, take the jet to my yacht
Letcha kick it for a week in my Caribbean spot
Coconut milk bath (bath), private beach, first class (class)
Water clear like glass (glass), waves ticklin' your ass
Cut the act baby, you need a change of pace
I deliver you a whole new world of taste
Guaranteed to put a different timid look on your face
Put the arch in your back when I'm grippin' your waist
Warren G keep flippin' the bass on key

Easily I spit game to make it hot
Headed straight for the motherfuckin G-Spot, you know

You got a lotta women out there preaching about
how they ain't a bitch or a ho but now
if you carry yourself in a fashionable matter
game can be matched both ways by a player

Yo 
I don't want no open caskets 
Don't be crying to me 
I don't want nobody standing there lying to me 
Talking about if you was there you would've died for me 
Took 5 for me 
Shoot blind for me 
Save the pipe dreams dog 
I'm gonna be aiight 
And even if I die tomorrow 
I'm gonna be aiight 
The only time I see my family 
When a relative die 
When you gone 
No pain 
Is it better to die 
Baby girl think I'm shy 
But I'm crying inside 
No tears in the jungle 
I'm a lion inside 
Nigga don't cry 
Like I said on the song 
God forbid I die early 
Please accept that I'm gone 
I lived mine 
Accomplished a lot in my time 
Soldier 
I sold mils for Pac 
Still I Rise 
You sympathize 
But I don't need it all 
But while we hearing breathing 
With the love that y'all 
We Outlawz 

Chorus 2x : Edi 

Some day 
One day we gotta go 
When and where 
Whom and why 
Nobody knows 
But when that day comes 
I'm ready to roll 
'Cause they won't roll when I go 

Verse 2: Edi 

Man 
Shit ain't right 
Yo it just ain't adding up 
My closest is gone 
I'm mad as fuck 
I'm more hurt than anything 
Not knowing what to do 
Completely wrapped up in confusion 
No clues 
Trusting other niggas thinkin shit is all gravy 
Mind unfocused 
'Cause I'm smoking daily 
Rolling with big ass body guards 
Niggas 
No guns 
Supposed to be protecting your ass 
He having fun 
Man fuck a vest 
My nigga did with one on 
Too much of a shock to my brain 
I could not mourn 
Do not shed a tear 
Close my eyes 
Said a prayer 
Hoping the lord let him in when he got there 
Still ride for Pac and Yak 
Seike too 
Still fucking the world 
You know how Edi do 
But I'm still crippled by the pain 
Still feel like I'm to blame 
Still want to go insane everytime I here your name man 

Chorus 2x 

Verse 3:  Kastro 

They say blood's thicker than water 
And I say love is thicker than blood 
Who's wrong 
And what's love 
With no honor and trust 
So I'd rather not bother 
Nothing much to discus 
These cards 
Dealt by God 
To my table 
Ain't the best 
And pretty much unstable 
And I don't know 
My friend from my foe 
So I move fast 
Think about shit slow 
Rightfully so 
I got my gun 
And walk through the slums 
Bubbling like gum 
Wide open 
I think I need more Motrin 
These streets is hot 
Man these bitches is smoking 
And everybody for out for self out here 
Man ain't no love left out here 
Just blood in my eye 
I can't even cry 
I wonder why 
So I don't even try

This here life of mine down this one way street
So unpredictable, tryin' to run into a Dollar
Drama all I seem to get into, can't rewind time
So the problems that's mine, is either solve 'em
Or deal with 'em tomorrow, can't borrow, ain't got a job
Money ain't circulatin', cops had the spot dropped
So it ain't no work in yay, What's up?
I'm thinkin' 'Damn, I need a Dollar'
I feel stuck and the hard times make me want to holla
God help me out here, oh no I'm with my last
Knowin' I can be the next to die, gone with the pass that
I don't want to feel like real life's hard to live
Fake 'cause when they do me, ay, this ain't no movie
Ain't no take too, you ever think about where your
Life goin' take you? ain't you grateful to be alive
Or you want to die 'cause life hates you, don't let it take you
Or make you or break you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, the game a get ya, hit ya hard and make ya fall
And you get broke with no hope and, no get back
Let's try hard to see success and not the stress and get there
You stay persistent long enough, you probably have shit where
Everything you need'll be exactly where it need to be
 
To me the streets and peace are never seen in 
See really forgot about the kids doin' what we did
Part of gettin' high watchin' time go by
Now they want to smoke and drink and ride on by
Catch a case, be at their pace and it's a long cold ride
Judge just gave Shorty Mack 1-0-5 and I doubt he'll live
To be a hundred and thirty three, they try to tellin' me he gon' die
Yo, in the penitentiary, he mentioned he needed me to send him a 
Package, I'ma shoot it to ya, man I know the game'll do it to ya
Yes it will like that, like that

[Verse 3]
For me, it's been a long time comin' with a stretch up in here
I ain't scared but I don't want to be dead
I caught the game tryin' to kill me and found out it's been
Several attempts, it hurts to know this shit gettin' so personal
At once, don't they know you can't do nothin' about it
Least you know the world'll never be crowded
The same thing that'll make you laugh'll make you cry
The same game that got you rich will make you die
Fuck the truth, we like livin' in a lie, it ain't no time
To try to find my lost mind, I'm on the grind, I got rent
I need nickels and dimes would I be sent and life be as a
Personal business, sell your service not your soul
If you ain't got no dough, Nah I ain't tellin' and try to go
And try to sell your brain, if you ain't got you a scale
And a barreler cane, I'm just sayin' got to use what you got
To, do what you want and most folks don't
I gotta handle mine, you better

Il a niqué la mère de sa mère
Pour enfin niquer sa mère
Nan, fallait mieux dire bonjour

Il a pas dit bonjour

Le respect s'demande pas, le respect se prend
Le respect se perd
Le respect s'demande pas, le respect se prend (arrache-le dès que tu peux)
Le respect se perd
Mais ne se gagne pas
Si, faire l'tapin, c'est ton gagne pain (mais ferme ta gueule!)
Viens pas t'étonner si on t'aime pas
Si on peut troquer ta vie contre un potatoes (ou un tempura)
J'crois t'as pas compris l'tempo
Parce que l'mec s'est vengé
Il a dit : ""Tous tes morts
Fils de pute, j'vais les manger!""
Cimetière communal
Il check toutes les pierres tombales
Il lâche deux/trois croix gammées
Il trouve la tombe à mémé
Il déterre la vieille
Les vers l'ont désossée
Donc il régurgite
Sur les fleurs déposées

Du coup, il s'est fait niquer sa mère
C't'a dire que l'mec arrivait
Tout l'monde a dit bonjour
Mais lui
Il a pas dit bonjour
Il s'est fait niquer sa mère
Il est parti chez lui
""Bonjour madame, j'vais t'niquer ta mère""
Il a niqué la mère de sa mère
Pour enfin niquer sa mère
Nan, fallait mieux dire bonjour
Mais lui
Il a pas dit bonjour

En fait, l'histoire est plus complexe
C't'a dire que l'mec a dit : ""Wesh""
Mais il a pas regardé dans les yeux
Les yeux, c'est le reflet de l'âme
Donc, frelon, quand tu dis, ""Wesh""
Faut regarder dans les yeux
Mais l'mec a dit, ""Wesh"", a téma ses pieds
C'est là qu'j'ai ouï
""J'vais niquer la mère de ta mère
Pour enfin niquer ta mère
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen la regardant dans les yeux""

C'est parti de pas grand chose (de rien du tout)
Ça rend nos parents chauves (miskine!)
J'ferme une parenthèse (enfin!)
En Charentaise
Le mieux, Sully'!

Les histoires vont trop vite, poto (Su-Sully!)
Fais gaffe à toi, c'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire
Si tu sors, poto, sors couvert, sors protégé
Pense à tout ce que tu peux, à tes amis
Si tu peux te protéger toi-même avec des gilets pare-balles
Avec des genouillères, avec des coudières, poto
Prends un casque, prends un truc pour protéger ton menton
Ta mâchoire, ton pif, poto

Fais attention, j’ai conscience lorsque j’consomme que j’consolide mon cancer
J’vais faire concis pour les conseils, je m’considère comme cafard
J’me casse la fraise pour pas cher, tant qu’à canner

Pour pas foutre le feu, je moonwalk machinalement
Tous ces pantins font de la Pop à chier
Même pire, ils péra comme des brosses à chiottes

C’est là que le videur s’active, m’empêche de ti-sor avant
L’entracte, alors je tire, cet enfoiré pisse v’là le sang
J’enfourche ma motocyclette surnommée ""Le Tricératops""
Derrière, les keufs s’écrient : ""Mais, surtout, visez la tempe!""
Au bout d’un coin de rue, je les ai semé
Ce n’est qu’à ce moment que j’ai crevé

Il me souhaite la bienvenue
Sur son sommier en carton, j’ai sommeil

Si c'est l'Sheitan, ne prends pas l'appel ; des hologrammes avant CaraMail
Tes frelons rament pour un autographe font du karaté, moi

Des darons j'attire, les lardons m'admirent

Tellement d'choses qu'Anissa censure pas
Tellement d'causes abyssales, tellement d'faux à l'image
Gros, t'es dans l'faux, parie pas, on t'déteste encore quand t'es riche
Même des langues entre tes miches, t'as osé troquer ton âme juste pour vendre des disques
Pédale, si tu savais seulement qui contrôlait l'bizz
J'veux m'balader à dos d'Diplodocus, ouais, ouais, mais l'physio refuse
Il vénère des bibelots occultes, rien qu'il parle de faciales
Pour nous bibi des kills et des kilos d'lotus
La loi est martiale, le choc est racial, l'Apocalypse est voulue (spartiate)
Avant qu't'agonises, évolue (pédé) ; tout pour la création
J'lé-rou des dragons juste bons pour la crémation ; mon boulot, c'est la récréation
Pas d'fellation, pas d'réaction, j'rassemble les fractions, à feu et à sang
T'as d'sacrés instrus mais l'a cappella tranche, en vrai, t'es pas bon
Dans une dimension plus juste, on t'aurait frappé la tronche (c'est ça)
Sean Paul, Get Busy, l'Pôle Emploi hait Sully (pas de bol)
Tellement d'mathafacks qui voudraient qu'on reste désunis
Tu taffes dans l'formol ou tu dors à l'usine? J'ai une carrière qui décolle en ""i""
Comme les soucoupes de la société VRIL, les colons tirent, le royaume s'étire
Le projet Haarp nous parle écologie, ils sont en avance sur la technologie

Deux putains je baise, il n'y a qu'elles qui font l'amour
Je ne sais plus faire la cour
Mon cœur a fermé sa douve; parfois, je rêve de ta fouffe

Je t’aime encore, mon p’tit père
Viens, on reste dans la caisse, roule un p’tit teh
J’nous ai vu dans la perte et la vitesse
Tous les deux dans la merde et la lumière
La vie d’ma mère que j’vais nous délivrer

Lezarman : boss de la secte, t'écrase, et comme un insecte
Et personne peut faire plus de 'seille, c'est lui qu'a crée les règles
Le chaînon manquant dans son tube à essai
Pas d'amulette, c'est lui qui crée la magie, lui qui crée la Matrice
Lui qui gère les graphiques, lui qui gère les affiches, et lui qui gère les Manix
Lezarman dans la soucoupe, dans la banque, dans ta foufoune
Qu'entasse nos cadavres dans sa soute pour le trafic d'organes
Et, lorsqu'il voyage
Des bombes H dans ses bagages
Lezarman a divisé nos langages
Lezarman, vieux comme le monde, sa grandeur de l'ombre

Lezarman est là, Lezarman est là, Lezarman est partout
Lezarman est noir, Lezarman est babtou
Lezarman, l'œuf ou la poule? Lezarman
La teuf à Kaboul, la ppe-fra, la schnouffe, Lezarman

Lezarman insère des pubs en subliminal dans les mangas animés

Whisky-coca sans coca, parle bien ou j'vais te poker
Deux meufs par jour, ouais, c'est le quota
L'respect, c'est par la porte à côté
L'heure du calumet me donne des visions
J'me tire dans l'espace, j'ai bientôt mon visa
Y a qu'des pauvres types à la télévision
J'veux qu'mon portrait remplace c'ui de Mona Lisa

Gros popotin, yeux de biche
Touche le fond et j'creuse la brèche

Había catorce cabezas apuntando a mis piernas 
Me reí de ellos se rieron de mí 
Siguieron las risas, yo me quiero morir 
Ok chango no se enojen 
¿dónde está josé que necesito hablar con él? 
Mejor hubiera sido no preguntar 
José sentado en una mesa vendiendo crack 

No way josé 

Alzó la voz y me invitó a compartir 
Contesté ni a un cumpleaños juntos vamos a ir 
Eres dealer hijo e'la chingada 
Tocás a mi hermana y te dejo hecho nada 
Mi reacción no le gustó 
Se puso nervioso, mi bocho apuntó 
Me dijo mother fucka ahora vas a bailar 
Y el gaucho culata comenzó a disparar
Sin darse cuenta alertó a la policía 
32 hombres armados destruyendo esa casita 
Me agarraron a mí me sentenciaron 4 años 
En la cárcel más pesada y yo no he hecho nada 
Me pusieron en el área de ministros coqueros 
Masticaban los barrotes con encías de cuero 
Yo dormía en un catre todo mal 
Y josé se reía en su pedestal 
Pero todo no me fué tan mal 
El jefe de la prisión era mi primo natal 
Su nombre: bruno, un gigante animal 
Que a la medianoche me ayudaría a escapar 
Por la cloaca traté de huir 
Pero el olor a mierda me impidió seguir
Salí corriendo de nuevo a dormir 
Esa celda inmunda parecía un jardín 

No way josé 

Sonaron las alarmas para ir a trabajar 
A mí con mucha suerte me detuvo un oficial 
Susurró chicote salís hoy 
Perdoná los golpes por equivocación
Al gordo cerdo le dije no es nada 
Pensando en realidad que se muera mañana 
Dsecubrieron que era inocente por fín 
Que josé era dealer y se iba a pudrir 
De su celda mucho humo va a salir 
Poque bruno con él se quiere divertir",No Way Jose,1994

Huí de la cama

Olvidando que

Yo había declarado 
Ante el gigante tatuado 
Y era como estudiarse el I ching parado 
Pero eso, eso estaba bien 
Yo te pregunté: vos que hacés acá 
Y me dijiste ""nada"" 
Y comenzaste a agredir a la gente 
Olvidando que

Cuanto más pesado más fuerte cae 

Y vos caiste fuerte 

Cuanto más pesado más fuerte cae 

Y recordaste cuando ataste 
El ángel a un poste te reías 
Y yo no entendía 
Te reías de todas tus heridas 
Le tirabas dardos y lecciones de vida 

Cuanto más pesado más fuerte cae 

No paraste hasta matarlo 
Y me dejaste con la boca abierta 
Cubriste mi cuerpo con tus ojos 
Y saltaste la reja

lejos de las aguas que son eternas

Por eso quiero encontrar esa carnada

Expedición al klama hama 

No dejes de respirar 
Oculta la selva bajo nuestro umbral 
Ya no quiero más gritar 
De la superficie quiero despegar 

Esta fortaleza ya no ama a nadie 
Nadie es quien engañe, nadie quien me dañe 
Y es inútil que entrenes tus trenes 
Aquí no tienen vía 
He visto a los leones cuidando nuestras vidas 
Te equivocas ante la mirada de la saga 
Tu golpe poco directo no hace nada nada 
Como chow yun fat mi cabeza chiva 
Tengo el estilo, la técnica para darte caída 
Cuando estés en el suelo 
Te brindaré la mano y un sueño 
Y si no eres leal 
Mil dragones pateando tu cuerpo 
Sabe, mi dolor es clandestino 
Como el contrato del cielo y el infierno 
Esta es la leyenda del tigre y el dragón 

Hey hermano, expedición al klama hama 

Mujer que me acompañas por las agujas del reloj 
Visión que me transporta riéndose del sol 
Pido perdón si asesino mis ánimos 
Hoy es el día herida, perdida está mi voz 
Amigo lento y veloz 
Sucede que despierto y lejos 
Y acompaño el manjar junto al arroz 
La cena se incendia día a día 
Sólo alimenta las desnutridas almas sin vida 
Librarás a las manos que quieran llegar 
Al lugar donde el agua se pueda besar 
Oirás, las palabras se fueron de allí 
Soñarás con un día poder despertar 
Caminar, encontrarte con la humanidad 
Llorarás, por lo que has visto y lo que verás 
Más allá, escuchaste a un niño callar 
Es su voz el recuerdo de lo que pasó

Después de todo lo que nos pasó 
Te vi sentada hablando con otro

Esta es mi trewa 
Tu próxima estación será mi lengua 
Esta es mi trewa 
Dame tu alma te doy la tierra 
Esta es mi trewa a, trewa a 

En la noche te haré ver 
La gota caer agujereando a un hada 
Te prometo de esto no decir más nada 
A cambio quiero tu espalda 
Sobre la misma cama 
Que una vez fue real como 
Nuestras almas 
Trepa la montaña de la nada 
Que hay un niño que es lágrimas 
Quizás es el mañana 
Te contará que un día 
La luna se partió sobre mi pecho 
Y el armagedón me brindó su eco 

Enciende una vela cada vez 
Que sobre mi cuerpo ella vea 
Caer las hojas 

Esta es mi trewa

Por que soy un wacho, porque soy un wacho amor

Ramas de humo en tu jardín
Ven que yo seré tu infante
Cristo hermano de metal
Ven y pelea por tu parte hasta que caiga el cielo

Alterando el sentido de solo estar vivo
El hechizo corriendo por tus venas
Sientes la esencia, la ciencia de tus piernas
Lámela hasta que grite ""dámela"", y empieza a entender de qué se trata la vida
Su pollera explota en busca de mi sexo, yo voy flotando en ella en mi mejor momento
Me muestra su volcan, su lava, su saliva
Me abre su puerta de entrada, no de salida

Volo nel cielo, sotto vedo il suolo
Per la famiglia gli estranei chi sono?
Vi racconto di me, voi chi siete?
Mi riconoscete, forse vi perdono
Passo la notte in studio giù da CoCo
Ho quattro angeli, forse uno buono
Cosa vuoi dalla vita?
Cosa vogliono queste persone?
Sanno cos'è la tensione, il dolore, l'amore?
A scuola filone
Poi quattro calci al pallone
Botte col tipo buffone
Lo chiamano palo, non perché accende il lampione
Arriva se arrivano i droni
Freddato, bacialo se muore
E poi cambio casa, nazione
Cresciuto coi grandi Al Capone
Scrivo a mio zio che è in prigione
Diceva ""un giorno farete i cantanti
Mi dedicherai una canzone""
Facciamo un giorno i latitanti

Il primo club, foto osè
Canne fruttate come narghilè

Cambio casa, ma sono di qua
Ancora sveglio, ma lei non lo sa
Mento se mi chiedi sto bene
Che girarci intorno non serve
Spesso dico ciò che conviene
Chi non mi conosce fraintende
Figlio di una famiglia interrotta
Spesso ho invidiato i miei amici
Ricordo ancora uscita di scuola
Sei di noi in due in motorini
Tute Diadora, strade a memoria
Canne di due pacchettini
La mia prima storia, cene a McDonald
Quanto eravamo aggressivi
Chissà ora dove sei?
Se parli mai di quei
Pomeriggi da me
A nasconderti dai miei
Insieme fino alle 6
Farlo senza far rumore
Poi scappare prima che
Tuo padre bussi al portone
E poi ad un tratto mi sono svegliato
Guardato intorno e tutto quanto era così cambiato
Crescere non era come l'avevo immaginato
Tu metti apposto cose che non so più dove stavano
E poi la musica, sbalzi d'umore
I veri amici: tre, quattro persone
I sacrifici, le mie paranoie
Cambiare vita per fare rumore

Valencia,"We watched the sunset and we told ourselves to never forget
Just how good it felt to be surrounded
By a town that we knew like the back of our hands
We felt alive, hoped for the very first time

Is it safe to say in the morning you'll come back?
And things will be the same
Cause since the day you left, you know I've
Had a hard time and I want you to know
If you hear these words won't you please just come back?

It's been a year now but I still appreciate the sundown
It reminds me somehow things will work out
And I'll fall to your arms, just like I'd always do
It felt so good, it was the very first time I felt alive
Yeah, so alive

Is it safe to say in the morning you'll come back?
And things will be the same
Cause since the day you left, you know I've
Had a hard time and I want you to know
If you hear these words, won't you please just come back?

If I could sing this out loud, I'd scream it to the clouds
And everyone in this town would know what I'm about
Rather die than feel this pain take me over again
It's so hard to let you go

Is it safe to say?
Is it safe to say in the morning you'll come back?

Valencia,"And it feels like this is the last chance I have to say
Every word that I've been fighting
Well, I have finally decided to hold my head up with pride
And accept the way life takes you through these changes
Cause when you reach the stars you've made it

It's just there's something that I've been dying to let you know
And now that you're gone I'm holding on and I just can't let go

I get a little down on myself
But when you came around my world felt new
I opened up my eyes to the light
And I saw deep inside of a love that was true

And if I ever let you go I'm hoping that some time will show
That you're the one, you're the one for me

And it feels like this is the perfect time
For me to say that deep down inside I'm hurting
But at least I know you're worth it

And if I hold myself with pride and accept the pain
Then life will take me through these changes
Cause I have so much left to see

It's just there's something that I've been dying to let you know
Cause now that you're gone I'm holding on and I just can't let go

I get a little down on myself

And if I ever let you go I'm hoping that some time will show
That you're the one, you're the one for me

So let's go back down to the bank of that river where
We can dive right in and forget
About the worries from the world outside
Cause you know my world, my worlds not over
Because I have an angel on my shoulder

And I'll be coming home and when I feel those butterflies
I'll see that I need to find a better way
Just to believe you're gone
So long, some day I'll find the strength to move on

I get a little down on myself
But when you came around my world felt new
I opened up my eyes to the light
And I saw deep inside of a love that was true

Así como los quieres así yo la quiero

Por que no estas conmigo en esta navidad.

No voy a imaginar que me llamas

Que los hombres no lloran
Cuando un amor se va

Que volver a empezar

Siento mas de una lagrima

Quebrando mi alma
Y mi voz

A punto de llorar
A punto de caer en el abismo

En esta noche que no estas aquí conmigo
Estoy a punto de llorar

Que de amor nadie muere
Que el tiempo puede mas
Que la herida que duele
Pero nada
Nada va a convencerme
Mi dolor es mas fuerte
Y se ha ido mi suerte

We was quiet flashy brothers
Strapped all along with the dirty 38 long
12 hour shift gate took case in state
you think he wont hold his weight
put the money on the plate and watch it get scraped

We get ape up in that club
Off that juice and hen
And its an no win situation
Fucking with them

You mean like Ewen at the front of the rim
Finger roll a dutch
Million dollar stage is touched
Techs gauges bust

Trust no one
The lone shogun
Rugged tim boots stompa
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher

Nothing can calm the quakage
When I break kid
Peace to my brothers up north
Doing state bids

This is the way we be rollin in the street
You know when we roll that we be packing the heat
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go

This is the way we be rollin in the club

She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit

Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...

To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night

And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep

Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride

On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs

I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style

It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off

While the government is selling off our dignity

Hold on to what you have

Valeria Lynch,"José: 
Donde estas?, donde estas?, 
La vida pasa y tú no estas 
Pero mi corazón te vuelve a buscar 

Valeria: 
Aquí estoy, aquí estoy, 
Y esperando en vano, la realidad me hizo crecer 

Ambos: 
Fue duro aquel final y no te pude olvidar 
Tu recuerdo ahora me ilumina y me hace pensar 
Que hay un mañana por cambiar y juntos recuperar, 
Aquel amor, aquel amor, que dormido esta 

José: 
Que paso?, Que paso? 
Aquel silencio te alejo, 
La noche te envolvió sin decir adiós 

Valeria: 
Basta ya, aquí estoy, 
Ven a tomar mi mano, déjame ser tu felicidad 

Ambos: 
Fue duro aquel final y no te puede olvidar 
Tu recuerdo ahora, me ilumina, 
Y me hace pensar, 
Que hay un mañana por cambiar, y juntos recuperar, 
Aquel amor, aquel amor, que dormido esta 

Que hay un mañana por cambiar, y juntos recuperar, 
Aquel amor, aquel amor, que dormido esta 
Aquel amor, que dormido esta.",Hay un Mañana,1990
Valeria Lynch,"En las buenas why en las malas
a mi lado siempre tu
de una forma sobrehumana
a mi lado siempre tu

No es tan facil convivir conmigo
sin embargo siempre al lado mio
mi buen amor, mi gran amor
siempre conmigo..

Mas, me das cada dia mas
alegria por el modo
que tienes de amar

Mas, tu cuerpo con el mio
no hare falta mas
te quiero al lado mio cada dia mas
yo soy un insaciable siempre quiero mas",Me das Cada Día Más,2004
Valeria Lynch,"Le mentí tantas veces que ayer al marcharse me dijo

Ojalá que no puedas ni besarla en la boca
Y al mirarla a los ojos que sospeche que hay otra
Que la arranca a tu vida lo que ella no puede
Que le arranca a tu sangre lo que no se atreve

Ojalá que no puedas destapar la botella
De tu vino caliente cuando duermas con ella
Estoy harta del trueque de la hipocresía
Que despierten sus pieles pensando en la mía

Ojalá que no puedas hacerle el amor cuando duermas con ella
Ojalá que no puedas hacerle el amor
Ojalá que no puedas
Ojalá que no puedas hacer que tu piel
Se agigante de sueños
Que se muera de ganas, que no tenga consuelo
Que le sangren las manos si acaricia tu piel
O acaricia tu pelo

Ojalá que no puedas, lo que hacías conmigo
Cabalgando en mi vientre te quedabas dormido
Y en tu boca quedaba mi tibio candor
Y en la mía quedaba tu loco sudor

Ojalá, ojala que no puedas tengo celos de amante
Porque sé que en tu cama soy lo más importante
Ella se hace la tonta porque le conviene
Se alimenta conmigo si no no te tiene

Me mintió tantas veces al decirme
Que por mi dejaría a su mujer y sus hijos
Me mintió tantas veces que anoche al marcharme le dije

Ojalá que no puedas hacerle el amor cuando duermas con ella
Ojalá que no puedas hacerle el amor
Ojalá que no puedas
Ojalá que no puedas hacer que tu piel
Se agigante de sueños
Que se muera de ganas, que no tenga consuelo
Que le sangren las manos si acaricia tu piel
O acaricia tu pelo

Se alimenta conmigo si no no te tiene",Ojala Que No Puedas,2017

Valeria Rossi,"Vuoi saltare di fiore in fiore
non puoi fare a mano di cogliere
hai quel vizio di curiosare
che non ti abbandona mai
tu sei nato per regalare
quei sorrisi che mi confondono
dentro lacrime passeggere
forse tu ti specchierai
tu sei bellissimo
ma non ti dai

che cos'hai in comune con il mare
hai sempre stelle su di te
di giorno scherzi con il sole
e con me
di notte poi vieni a cercare
tra le onde di convincermi
che l'acqua che scorre non fa male
su di me

vuoi una notte da ricordare
ma durante il giorno tu dove sei
prima o poi tu darai il tuo cuore
a chi non sa che farsene
tu sei bellissimo ma non ti dai

Valerie Capers,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair",All in Love Is Fair,1982
Valerie Capers,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo.

Valerie Capers,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1999

Oh, my darlin', what do you say
Do you tell them that you love me
After midnight, when the boys talk about the girls

Oh, my darlin', do you tell them
Little secrets that you shouldn't
After midnight, when the boys talk about the girls

Do they say we won't last
And when a week or two has passed
Do they keep tellin' you
That then we'll love somebody new?

Valerie Day,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
