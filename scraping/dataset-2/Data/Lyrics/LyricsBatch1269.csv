Whitney Houston,"O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear savior's birth (oh yes it is now)
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til he appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn'

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
Oh, oh night when Christ was born
Oh night
Oh holy, holy night
Oh night di- divine

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
Oh, oh night, oh when Christ was born
Oh night
Oh night
Oh holy night
Oh night divine
Mmm",Cantique De Nöel,2003
Whitney Houston,"(Oh well oh Lord)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (well)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (well)
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

You now that, you know that, you know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
Everybody's mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Happy Hanukkah
Happy Kwanzaa
Merry Christmas to
To all of you
Merry Christmas to everyone",The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),2003

If there were no presents
Waiting on Santa's sleigh
What would I wish for Christmas
And if Frosty the snowman
Were melting away
I would pray for hope and unity
On Christmas day

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy
And peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one

If Rudolph and his reindeer
Ran into delays
I'd still hope for joy this season
And if somehow Santa got lost on his way
I would try to find a way to smile
Smile on Christmas day

There would be joy
And peace here on earth

Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along

I wish that I could fly away
And party 'til the break of day
And there I'll be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me

Then mama comes and asks me
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun
It's the only way I'll ever find

Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line 
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

[Chorus]

Didn't we have the beat of times
When love was young and new? 
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
Cause once you know what love is 
You never let it end

[Chorus]",Didn't We Almost Have It All [DVD],2007
Whitney Houston,"Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)


[Chorus]

Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, to wish you well

Whitney Houston,"Oh yeah
Nothing's better than family,
For the ones who love you so
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need
They will never leave you alone
When your friends bring you down
And they drag you through the dirt
And nobody is around
They will carry you through the hurt

Just remember that family comes first
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first

I can see you crying someone broke your heart,
Instead of being with those who love you,
You spend time apart, it's because you think
They won't understand
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your
Hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you.

Just remember that family comes first
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first

Don't you be ashamed of your family, put you into this earth,
And that's what its worth unconditionally, sometimes you may
Disagree and wont see eye to eye
Don't you run away they will be right by your side
Oh oh

Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),

Whitney Houston,"Friday night you and your boys went out to eat

Down on 54th St.
So why did 213
Show up on your Caller I.D.

I've been through all of this before 
So how could you think
That I would stand around
And take some more
Things are gonna change
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more fears and tears
For you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me

You were making a fool of me

Whitney Houston,"Many nights we prayed 
With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hope for a song 
We barely understood 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

In this time of fear 
When prayer so often proves in vain 
Hope seems like the summer bird 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
My hearts so full, I can't explain 
Seeking faith and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles 
When you believe (When you believe) 

Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve) 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

They don't always happen when you ask 
And it's easy to give in to your fears 
But when you're blinded by your pain 
Can't see the way, get through the rain 
A small but still, resilient voice 
Says hope is very near, oh 

There can be miracles (Miracles) 
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail (Though hope is frail, it's hard)
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)

I had no where to turn
I had no where to go
Lost sight of my dream,

Thought it would be the end of me
I thought I'd never make it through
I had no hope to hold on to,
I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain

I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up

Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

Found hope in my heart,
I found the light to life
My way out the dark
Found all that I need
Here inside of me

I thought I'd never find my way
I thought I'd never lift that weight
I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain

I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up

Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

There were so many times I
Wondered how I'd get through the night I
Thought took all I could take

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain

I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms 
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms 
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care

Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

His heart was so hardened that he would not believe.

His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd 
I've never seen my daddy inside the house of God 
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod.

When God called on Mother one night 
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken 
Asking our daddy to raise her children right.

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run
I thought by now that I'd be realizing, what's done is done

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Oh there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do

If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not runnin', for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see, first it was a dream, I was livin' in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the WORLD ranked number one
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I, arrived, the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage, to make a speech
about the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

If I ruled the world
Huh-huh, huh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world

People started flowin' as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringin' me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancin' to the beat and entertainin' La-Di-Da-Di
The music started endin', it was time for a speech
The crowd started sittin' as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream, I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please, for stoppin' this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know out that office I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothin' in the world like bein' number one king!

If I ruled the world
Huh huh huh huh, huh-huh huh-huh
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em love 'em baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, ooh yeah yeah
If I ruled the world, whoa yeah
If I ruled the world

Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rollin' with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker emcees that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love, and happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king, and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's runnin' the show

And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doin', and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war, and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dyin' overseas
While you sucker mission politicians bustin' out Z's
Huh, twenty million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe

And it's time for a change, to a better way
'Cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day
So listen up world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
They came up to my face, as happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

And I probably won't leave until the thing ends
But in the mean time, the in between time
If you work your thing, then I'll work mine
We came here together so we could have fun
Me and you baby, goin one on one
Now this is the last chance for us to get off
So either get loose, or you aught to get lost
Cause I'm just about ready to do my thing
Cause I'm the stone cold, New York, Rap Machine
I'm 'a give you what I got, and baby that's plenty

And I go by the name of the Rapper Jalil

Now sit back, relax, put on your head gear
Get ready for a trip through the Atmosphere
Gonna take you for a ride through the Twighlight Zone
I don't need a space ship, I use my microphone
So hold on tight, with all your might
Cause Ill be rappin like this for the rest of the night
Its Jalil y'all, your master rapper
And when I'm on the mic its a sheer disaster
Cause MC's crumble when we rumble
Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
So all you MC's, I hope you're real good listeners
Cause in this battle, I'm takin no prisoners
I'm slayin MC's right on the spot
Cause I'm the the master of the Rap, the doctor of the Rock
The Jack of all Trades, The Master of One
And the thing I'm at, is called havin fun
We got three minutes left to rock this funk
To separate the good stuff from the junk, so
Get in the groove, and feel the sound
And once you're inside, spread yourself around
From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
Come on Master Dee, get funky while we got em
 
*three minutes left*
 
Me and my partner, from the start
We usually get together, after dark
Sometimes to rap, Sometimes to sing
In the Summer or the Winter cause it ain't no thing
And ever since I first came round
Side by Side, We'd throw down
We came here to this here place
To serve you all right to your face
Because this jam here is our show stopper
We didn't want to do it but I guess we gotta
We're the men of the hour, makin the ladies scream and holler
To hot to trot, To sweet to be sour
I'm gonna set the record straight
And I hope that it is not too late
If you want the best, I won't settle for less
Put your money on me, I'm your best bet
Come on,
One for the treble
Two for the Bass
Three for the ladies
Four for the plaid
Five, minutes of funk, this ain't no junk
So pull your bottom, off the tree stump
Ladies real pretty, from city to city
But now we're gettin down to the nitty gritty
From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
I'm gonna rock em, while I still got em
Our rappin shower has style and power
And this, is our disco hour
I don't know what all of you have heard
So its up to me to spread the word
About the man that we feel has got to be real
Our crowned Prince on the wheels of steel
He goes by the name of Grandmaster Dee
So if its alright with you, its alright with me
We gonna rock you people's minds with ease
With some help from the Maestro, if you please

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends
 
When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
 
You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

And now you're kinda cold to the people you meet
Cause of something that was done to you by some creep

She said 'rap attack', man, not 'heart attack'

Oh, you mean she's alright then?

Of course, man
You never heard of a Mr. Magic Rap Attack?
Where is this guy from, man?
[ Ecstacy ]
Oh, I heard of a heart attack or a big mac attack
But what's a rap attack?
[ Jalil ]
Come here, man, I see I'ma have to explain it to you like this
See, a rap attack means..

[ Jalil ]
Deejays jammin in the street
MC's rappin to the beat
The people downstairs sayin they can't sleep
Cause the people upstairs are stompin their feet
It's not like they're startin a riot
""We'll call the cops, cause we want some quiet!""
There's no need for them to get excited
They're just mad because they're not invited

(It's all in Mr. Magic's Wand)

[ Ecstacy ]
Oh see, now I understand what a rap attack is
[ Jalil ]
Well, it's about time!
[ Ecstacy ]
All you had to do is explain it to me
But let me ask you a question:
How long have they been rockin like this?

[ Jalil (& Ecstacy) ]
Well, rapping's always been around
(Well, it says that it's big time now)
Every neighborhood had its own crew
(That meant you against me) and me against you
(They would jam every weekend at the neighborhood center)
And charge a small price for the crowds to enter
(The parties would be packed inside and out)
To see who was best at rockin the house

(It's all in Mr. Magic's..
..Wand)

[ Jalil ]
Cause then Magic went on the radio
And everybody said: ""What a way to go!""
The moment he went on the air
It was plain to see a new phase was here
He started out playing mostly rap
Then they all said: ""Nobody's into that""
Well, they all turned out to be wrong
Cause rappin on the mike had caught on strong
Some still say it's not what's happenin
After 'Rapper's Delight' went triple platinum
The record world was in for a smash
Sugarhill, Kurtis Blow, to Grandmaster Flash
Blondie, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie
They even made a rapper out of me
In no time at all a star was born
And I think he owes it all to his Magic Wand

[ Ecstacy (& Jalil) ]
Now that you heard our rap and you caught a contact
(And by now you're all to be blasted)
We want you all to know that we got to go
(But it was big fun while it lasted)
Hey y'all, but we'll be back again, so tell all your friends
(Good things don't always come to an end)
With somethin innovative (to rock you all well)

There's no one way, it can be explained
I guess it's the way I smile, when I hear your name
It's the little things that you do, that mean so much
It's the care that you put, into every touch
It's the way I touch you, and you touch me
I guess some of us, are so lucky

[Jalil]
I was known for having, the upper hand
I was known as a stone cold ladies man
If it wasn't for you, I'd be that way still
But lately there's a change, in Jalil
All thought my friends play games, and teach me a lot
I know I'm more than happy, wit what I got
When I get up in the morning, and go to work
See all day long, I stay alert
'Til we come home at night, and close your door
Two people sharing, one common cause
When I say one love, you can trust me
'cause never have I been so lucky

Chorus:4x
[Ecstacy] 
And we represent like this)
[Jalil & Ecstacy]
One Love, One Love
You're lucky just to have just One Love

Verse 2:
[Ecstacy]
Now the love I use to have just left me cold
I use to buy everything from diamonds to gold
For I thought she'd left me, 'cause I didn't buy her enough
'cause she left me alone, with all of my stuff
That maybe one of these days, you'll have to learn
That love is something, that you have to earn
And once you earn it, you gotta know how to keep it
You got to want it, as well as you need it
To have lost love, was a hurten lesson
But to a mad love, it's a definite ?
And I know what the Beatles were thinking of
When they said that money can't buy you love

[Jalil]
Well that's all stuff, what do you mean
I just went through, the exact same thing 
M-m-mind was lost, for a whole different reason
I lost my love, 'cause she was cheatin'
Started roamin' through the streets, all day and night
Gets greedy best describes such an appetite
Wish I had a bat, but if you means a whip
Guess a bird in the hand, beats two in the bush
Like to thank you girl, for teaching me love
But all and all, I had a ball
Guess it's better to have loved and to have lost
Then to never have loved at all

Chorus:4x

[Ecstacy]
Well I think it's 'bout time, that we break it down
This is all about the love, that we lost and found
About the love that we ?, and the love that we shared
About the love that just, up'd and disappeared
About who's was bout real, and who was fake
So you can learn, from our mistakes

[Jalil]
'cause see it was already written, good and said
So you can stay, two steps ahead
Of the L(echo), for the love which you give
The O(echo), is for the love who we live
And the V(echo), is for the vivrant letter
The E means may we last forever and ever(echo 7x)

Chorus: 2x",One Love,1990

They wear rips and zippers all in their shirts

They do it in the park, they do it in the dark
But most freaks are known for breakin' hearts
You could never tell what a freak was thinkin' of
And you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
And they don't walk, when they step, they strut
And nine times out of ten they drive you nuts

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends

And if you ask me, you know, I couldnt be much help
Because A friend is somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake kindness for bein a fool

We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close too this very day

Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends
 
When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
Then came the arguements and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It couldnt last long because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong

Because we became lovers before we were friends

You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned

But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so swift, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
 
You wonder how long it was all going on
And your still not sure if your man is gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie

Oh my God, I think I'm having a rap attack..
[ Ecstacy ]
Somebody get a doctor!
Quick, man
She's having an attack!
[ Jalil ]
She said 'rap attack', man, not 'heart attack'
[ Ecstacy ]
Oh, you mean she's alright then?
[ Jalil ]
Of course, man
You never heard of a Mr. Magic Rap Attack?
Where is this guy from, man?
[ Ecstacy ]
Oh, I heard of a heart attack or a big mac attack
But what's a rap attack?
[ Jalil ]
Come here, man, I see I'ma have to explain it to you like this
See, a rap attack means..

[ Jalil ]
Deejays jammin in the street
MC's rappin to the beat
The people downstairs sayin they can't sleep
Cause the people upstairs are stompin their feet
It's not like they're startin a riot
""We'll call the cops, cause we want some quiet!""
There's no need for them to get excited
They're just mad because they're not invited

(It's all in Mr. Magic's Wand)

[ Ecstacy ]
Oh see, now I understand what a rap attack is
[ Jalil ]
Well, it's about time!
[ Ecstacy ]
All you had to do is explain it to me
But let me ask you a question:
How long have they been rockin like this?

[ Jalil (& Ecstacy) ]
Well, rapping's always been around
(Well, it says that it's big time now)
Every neighborhood had its own crew
(That meant you against me) and me against you
(They would jam every weekend at the neighborhood center)
And charge a small price for the crowds to enter
(The parties would be packed inside and out)
To see who was best at rockin the house

(It's all in Mr. Magic's..
..Wand)

[ Jalil ]
Cause then Magic went on the radio
And everybody said: ""What a way to go!""
The moment he went on the air
It was plain to see a new phase was here
He started out playing mostly rap
Then they all said: ""Nobody's into that""
Well, they all turned out to be wrong
Cause rappin on the mike had caught on strong
Some still say it's not what's happenin
After 'Rapper's Delight' went triple platinum
The record world was in for a smash
Sugarhill, Kurtis Blow, to Grandmaster Flash
Blondie, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie
They even made a rapper out of me
In no time at all a star was born
And I think he owes it all to his Magic Wand

[ Ecstacy (& Jalil) ]
Now that you heard our rap and you caught a contact
(And by now you're all to be blasted)
We want you all to know that we got to go
(But it was big fun while it lasted)
Hey y'all, but we'll be back again, so tell all your friends
(Good things don't always come to an end)
With somethin innovative (to rock you all well)

Where I would come around
I’d build this place like a church
With all the things I found

This place would be like a home
That loneliness has made
It will be just like a hotel
Where no one ever stays

So I run and I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run from the place where you said I should stay and was gone
Cause there’s nothing to say if there’s nothing that I could have done
So I run and I run and I run and I run
I once imagined this place

Now there’s a crack in my heart
Where all the dirt gets in
There is a face in my mind
That I can’t face again

So I run and I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run from the place where you said I should stay and was gone
Cause there’s nothing to say if there’s nothing that I could have done
So I run and I run and I run and I run

Staring from the cliff off the coast of my life
Seeing everything get smashed like bricks of ice
I’m watching it fall

So I run and I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run from the place where you said I should stay and was gone
Cause there’s nothing to say if there’s nothing that I could have done

I give a fuck who's who
I chef the same when I'm preparing it
From bad kid to semi-rich middle-aged American
Rooted in my heritage, wounded for the derelicts
The root of every evil is the truth of all appearances
I crack the sound but the beat is still a barrier
And every fucking inch of every street around this area
The Venice carry us up like dough rises
Rap transit all city, no license
The city is beneath, I watch it from a bird's eye
Brain dead, two left, they shot me in my third eye
Shot out my eye like ? on a Christmas day
Reach for pistols as I watch the fuckin' Pistons play
I set the tone with the writings on the wall
The city cleans it up like we inviting 'em all
Evolution's all messed up now, chop the middleman
Stab the messenger, not the literal
I ran without a cause and was the best before I knew shit
Before I took a cruise ship, before I been to Houston
I ain't tying up loose ends I let 'em waiver
Pulling out these lavers and pounding out the pavement
Gone

I'm the lyrical gangsta

I be a young motherfucker of the rap camp
Style symbolizes my nastiness like a tramp stamp
Wamp wamp, where it's at
Fear fact, just let them legends die and I'll inherit that
I'm fit for the carry, weight of the world I carry on my back
With a fairer sack, inquisitions to the mirror
Exactly what niggas fearing, see the future in it's clearest
It is I, Doms, dropping lyrical pipe bombs
Until an icon, I choke your life like a python
I'm who the children look up, probably got 'em doing kush ups
Super high, call me Superfly, bitch I'm Jimmy Snuka
Got you feeling like you took a hit of heroin
And that's for veterans, the way I bury 'em, embarrassing
You know better than puttin' that fire near the kerosine
I said don't make me tell again like kids with speech impediments
They can't see where my head is, I'm ahead
Roll the credits, roll the medics
Getting high till I feel I'm copacetic

I'm the lyrical gangsta

Yo I've been trying to keep it silent, my tendency to violence
The suit and tie be fading, the truth about the shining
The sliding through the masses, smiling eyes through glasses
My style been altercated all the while to pile my cash in
But fuck that though, I want a ho that stay up late
My dirty bottom bitch to fuck with me until the wake
Mad illegal C.R.E.A.M, ain't no rules, that's the dream
In regal swimming pools prepping tools for future schemes
Laying low and creeping it, selling dope and sleeping it
Wrap the dough up in a rope, keep in what I'm sleeping in
Mattress fettucini, life's a flick and I'm Fellini
Pinky diamond rings above the rims of ice martinis
Trees throughout the day, hour focused in a haze
We living life the most, been comatosed all the way
The toast to hell that may, cause making bread legit's too real
So I'm folding on the stress of life to steal to catch a meal

Wibal & Alex,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",A Mi Manera,2007
Wicked,"Daddy's home

Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin' time
For you to be comin' home talkin' that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)

For all this time, so sorry baby!

Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin' to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh, I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry

Wrapped on through our heads and around our spines
Cooling off the burning floor

A few good cats to help me pass the day

Watching the sun shine, matinee
Never the wrong time, time we stay
Living the moontime, time we play

From here I watch the world go by
Working in the moon-time bar and grill
The word from Earth my time is up
But here upon the moon time stands still
Got no telecommunications
Cables haven't gotten out this way
The man in the moon is a musician
That's the way we pass the lunar day

Widespread Panic,"A little wrangler was born
I seen him squirming in the saddle all wet and warm
He's such a changeable form in his very first year

He rides on to wrangler school
With a slingshot and a saddlebag of hand-me-down tools
Doesn't want to look like a fool
Pass the jail without tears

Time machines, remembered scenes
That a wrangler rides through a passing stream
Time's replaced by a peaceful dream
Wrangler space

He reigns his pony to the gate of the school
Feather pens and inkwells of hand-me-down rules
Like trading a pony for an aging mule
He rides away without fear

Time machines, new routines
That a wrangler rides through a passing dream
And time's replaced by a peaceful stream
Space wrangler space

He gets off at a stranger's place
Where the girls dance different with familiar grace
He's knowing that he found the place
That pours the coldest beer

High, your dreams so clear
Raise another glass to the dreams so near",Space Wrangler,1988

Widespread Panic,"C. Brown wakes from bed
Brushes his teeth and he combs his head for school
Out the door and down the street
Down to the corner and a bus and some friends that he's supposed to meet
But there, not to his surprise
His friends have gone and they've told see a lie


But you can walk on with me
You don't even need to say a word
You don't have to worry about the others


I see (see) him and he runs up fast
Kicks at the air his friends watch him fall and then laugh
Charlie really likes his friends
But in his heart he knows that sometimes a dog is as good as any man
Trying to do as we should
That doesn't always rhyme with doing what feels good


But you can sit in the grass; it feels good
You don't even need to think a word
You don't have to worry, don't worry


Charlie there is drawing a gun
Right there in the square he's sketched Lucy on the run
Aims his eye, cocks his head
In a cloud of dust, dear old Lucy's gone
Charlie's only trying the golden rule
Draw unto others as they have been drawn to you


And you can walk on home with me
You don't even need to think a word
You don't have to worry...

Catching peanuts between his teeth
And the dogs lying in the shadow in the archway
There's one good dog sleeping filled with good ol' dog dreams


He slipped next to the wizard
Whispered something deep, to the bottom of his ear
A little joke, the one about the farmer's daughter
How she was stomping on grapes, coming up with blue feet and beer
And he slipped behind the queen
Where the fools go the rich don't mind
Lately the king's (k)nights have turned a little rusty
And his halo - I mean his crown - has gone and slipped down around his eyes

Pulling lizards between his knees
And the dog he been long gone
Gone to pitch for the winning team

For us all, For us all

Widespread Panic,"Well, Old Joe, he moves slow
He likes to look at things and paint pictures on his radio
He says they make the songs look better.

One day, Joe met a girl
Sweet breathing thing
Dancin' naked, nudey, in the winter snow
Underneath her dozen sweaters

And someday, somewhere
Some things get hit by lighting
And some things just don't
Hope we live long and lucky

At least one things for sure
Or maybe it isn't.
No matter where we are
It's this life that we're livin' in

Widespread Panic,"I was walkin' the other day with my head down,
When I met a man who had his hand out.
So I gave him, gave him a dollar,
But as I walked away I heard him call out,

""Tell me Brother, can you see the sun
From where you're standin' now?
I've been up and I've been down,
But I've never been to this part of town.""

So I started thinkin' 'bout, this world we live in,
And about how far I've got my hand in.
Sometimes it seems that all we have, we have taken,
But maybe next time, won't be the forsaken.

Tell me Brother, can you see the sun
From where you're standin' now?
I've been up and I've been down,
But I've never been to this part of town.

So I went to see my girl, told her about my day.
She said, ""Life can be that way.
But don't give up, don't give up, no,
'Cause where there is love, there is hope.""

Tell me Brother, can you see the sun
From where you're standin' now?
I've been up and I've been down,
But I've never been here before.

We're in a maze, baby

All alone
What doesn't kill you has a momma's way of
Helping ya learn

Blast off!

Push it through

Don't tow it away

After today

My fingers might hurt swollen
Live another day, get lucky that way
Sound of thunder when the gods go bowling

Lucky is as lucky does

I sidestepped to intercept her
She got mad but I was looking meaner
She knew I could protect her

Might be fear, but it could be love
Don't try to make it easy, only makes it harder
Just take it easy, baby, don't try, don't try, don't try
I'll come home when the clowns come home

Walking side by side down a blind night road
Something's creeping in the woods beside us
Arm and arm we're creatures, two heads and six legs
Ain't nothing gonna try to bite us

I'm going home like the clowns come home
Don't try to make it easy, only makes it harder

Another stormy night up in Memphis
A band of black clouds rides overhead
Slept seven days and nights on an old greyhound dog
Came limping in to Union Station

Now that I have had my fun
It's good to be back again
We finally found the place in time
To call our own

Let her cry, let her cry, let her cry
She is inconsolable
Let her cry, let her cry, let her cry

We just walk away from here

You should be happy
That the day is new

I was dreaming we were floating down the Natchez Trace
Our angels were falling in
I saw the outline of a spirit sliding cross the river
Laughing at cracks about the devil's backbone

Walking in the haze, Sunday's Independence Day
Another good excuse for a celebration
We sang songs of liberty
Kind of takes the sting out of occupation

Now that I have had my fun
It's good to be back again
We finally found the time and place
To call our own

She is uncontrollable
Let her cry, let her cry, let her cry
She is inconsolable

Widespread Panic,"Early this morning
I heard you knock upon my door
Early this morning
I heard you knock upon my door
I said, ""Hello, Satan,
I believe it's time to go""

Me and the devil
We were walking side by side
Me and the devil
We were walking side by side
I'm gonna love your woman, Satan

She said, ""You may know your ways
But I've been dogged around""
""You may know your ways 
But I can hear you come to dog me around""
Must be that evil spirit
Way deep down in the ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
That way my evil spirit

Oh! Heaven. 
It is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens

And there is a party. 
Everyone is there.
Everybody gonna leave at exactly the same time.
Its hard to imagine that nothin' at all
Could be so exciting, could be this much fun.

Oh! Heaven. 
It is a place
A place where nothing, nothing ever happens

And when the kiss is over, we'll start again.
It won't feel any different.

Oh in the summer, smoking palace welcoming all the full hearted

Long that moon will shine it's light on a sordid celebration

Givin' birth to the city lights like it was always meant to be
Ships sail in with foreign hands some who never leave
Every child a woven basket the night is new years eve

When sugar was queen

Hold on shady cat on the back of time's parade

Things aren't all they seem
Every prison's not a cage
And I've learned one thing for sure
All things must change

So I've lived my life
Through rose colored eyes
Life's so unreal from the stage
But the limelight fades away
All things must change

There is no rhyme, there is no reason
Don't look to me for answers
I'll give you metaphors
And though a lying heart is treason
My only fear is sorrow
My pain is in the score
And nothing more

Senses overload
Fields of depth explode
Mental fabric starts to fray
False reality
Life's triviality
Psychotic images remain

As I live the passion play
Ooh all things must change
Have I thrown my life away?
All things must change

Corporate dynasties
Bring me to my knees
Negotiations strangulate
Faceless suited droids
Fight to fill some void
Sacrificial offerings escalate

And they don't know who to blame
All things must change
Lord, I'll never be the same
All things must change

When I've seen it all 
Another curtain falls
Depth of feelings hard to gauge
Twisted pictures pass
Through the tainted glass
I relive it all in silent rage

So quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare

The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth
Polly with the wild life, cannibal out
Give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette

Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
Annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette
Scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip
Face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
Bad bitch with the black six, after my dick
She like, this your pussy, and she smash my click
Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
Niggaz straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law
Stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
For a taste of it, the chick strip, clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams

But if we run the race like a thug
We would lose that mind that we made of

Liable to pull a knife from out of his heal
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand

You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
One man, can't uplift the land
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant
Splendid, unprecidented, hip hop vintage
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us

Boris would double-cross him 
make off with the dough and toss him 
into a pit of crocodiles and foul-pest aargh!

On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,
Wil Gravatt,"Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come to town about twice a year

He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
'Fore my time but I've been told
He never come back from Copperhead Road

Now Daddy ran whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside

Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound
When the Sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first,'round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Columbia and Mexico
I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
And now the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie don't you know
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

Wil Hendricks,"When your heart aches 
Like it was left out in the rain.
Your fingers feel frozen &fake
From touching cold, dishonest things. 
You musn't worry about the time,
It floats in air brine. 
I just drink it like it's wine, anyway. 

If yr lost, you can call me.
You can call me, &i will find you.
I will find you, today. 

when your day ends 
The morning seems so far away.
All your close closet friends leave
Only perfume or smoke in their place.
You musn't worry about the time,
It floats in air &brine. 
&i just drink it like it's wine, anyway.

If yr lost, you can call me.

To the fly caught in his web,
The fly feels a whole lot better

Never to wake, 
I think he made a big mistake.

Wil.,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.

Wilbert Longmire,"Would you mind if I touch,
If I kiss, if I held you tight
In the morning light
Would you mind if I said how I felt tenderly tonight
Again cause

I never ever felt this way in my heart before
Love has found it's way in my heart tonight

Would you mind if I looked
Into your eyes till I'm hypnotized
And I lose my pride
Would you mind if I make love to you till I'm satisfied

Just friends, but not like before

Wilbur De Paris,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [*],1956
Wilbur De Paris,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,

Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Wilbur De Paris,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2000

Wilbur Ware,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1957
Wilbur Ware,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1957
Wilbur Ware,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go

Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes

When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me

Wilbur Ware,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you

These things are dear to me

Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds? 
You laughed as I covered you over with leaves 
Face, breast, hips, and thighs 
You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes 

Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine 
Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled wood vines twine 
Trees held us in on all four sides so thick we could not see 
I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me 

Your arm was brown against the ground, your cheeks part of the sky 
Your fingers played with grassy moss, as limber you did lie 
Your stomach moved beneath your shirt and your knees were in the air 
Your feet played games with mountain roots as you lay thinking there 

Below us the trees grew clumps of trees, raised families of trees, and they 
As proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away 
The sun was hot and the sun was bright down in the valley below 
Where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go 

There in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned 
Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned 
There on our mountain bed of leaves we learned life's reason why 
The people laugh and love and dream, they fight, they hate to die 

The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown 
Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown 
Your shape and form is dim but plain, there on our mountain bed 
I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head

I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams 
To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas 
I stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land 
And I know why farms and cities are built by hot, warm, nervous hands 

I crossed many states just to stand here now, my face all hot with tears 
I crossed city, and valley, desert, and stream, to bring my body here 
My history and future blaze bright in me and all my joy and pain 
Go through my head on our mountain bed where I smell your hair again. 

All this day long I linger here and on in through the night

That faced the Ku Klux Klan
On hollow grove's golfing ground
His words come sounding

And all around him there
To jump and clap and cheer
I sent the best I had, the best I had
My thirty thousand

The Klansman leader said
That Paul would lose his head
When thirty five thousand vets
Broke up that concert

But less than four thousand came
To side with the Klan
But around Paul's lonesome oak
My thirty thousand

A beersoaked brassy band
Did snortle round the grounds
Four hundred noblest souls
Westchester's manhood

And they looked exactly like
The fleas on a tiger's back
Lost fish in the waters of
My thirty thousand

When Paul had sung and gone
And the kids and babies home
Cops came with guns and clubs
And they clubbed and beat 'em

Well, I'd hate to be a cop
Caught with a bloody stick
'Cause you can't bash the brains
Out of thirty thousand

Each eye you tried to gouge
Each skull you tried to crack
Has a thousand, thousand friends
Around this green grass

If you furnish the skull someday
I'll pass out the clubs and guns
To the billion hands that love
My thirty thousand

Each wrinkle on your face
I know it at a glance
You cannot run and hide
Nor duck nor dodge them

Will fertilize the seeds

On my good horse, I call you 
My shiny black Bess 

To the playhouse of fortune 
To take the bright silver 
And gold you have taken 
From somebody else 

And as we go riding 
In the damp foggy midnight 
You snort, my good pony 
And you give me your best 

For you know and I know

From the widows and orphans 
And never a hardworking man I oppressed

Can ever overtake you 
And there's not a rider

In this dark mist and midnight

Chase the unwelcome guest

As we trot in this dark here 
That robbing the rich 
Is for worse or for best 

They take it by stealing 
And lying and gambling 
And I take it my way 
My shiny Black Bess 

I treat horses good 
And I'm friendly to strangers 
I ride and your running 
Makes my guns talk the best 

And the rangers and deputies 
Are hired by the rich man 
To catch me and hang me 
My shining black Bess 

Yes, they'll catch me napping one day 
And they'll kill me 
And then I'll be gone 
But that won't be my end 

For my guns and my saddle 
Will always be filled 
By unwelcome travelers 
And other brave men 

And they'll take the money 
And spread it out equal 
Just like the Bible 
And the prophets suggest 

But men that go riding 
To help these poor workers 
The rich will cut down
