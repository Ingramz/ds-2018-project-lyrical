You're lying to yourself while I lie in the sun
Hold your broken dreams close to your broken heart
It's nothing new to me 'cause I've been broke right from the start
I soared from the sky like an angel in the dark
You're trying to catch my wings you think you're someone that you're not
The water's crystal clear I walk while your make-up runs
The last words that you hear
Blondes have more fun

Tiga Sontag,"I never used to cry 'cause I was all alone
For me myself and I is all I've ever known
I've never felt the need to have a hand to hold
And everything I do I take complete control
That's where I'm coming from
My lucky number's one
I've everything I need to keep me satisfied
There's nothing you can do to make me change my mind
I'm having so much
My lucky number's one

I now detect an alien vibration here
There's something in the air besides the atmosphere
The object of the action is becoming clear
An imminent attack upon my heart I fear
The evidence is strong
My lucky number's wrong

You certainly do have a strange effect on me
I never thought that I could feel the way I feel
There's something in your eyes that gives me a wild idea
I never want to be apart from you my dear
I guess it must be true
My lucky number's two

This rearrangement suits me now I must confess
If number one is down number two is best
I want to stay with you

Tigah,"Yo, you got five seconds to get to the dance floor
The roof about to blow, so so, let's go

Uh haha, remix
All I see over here ain't nothin' but a lot of honies lookin' for man
And niggas with a lot of money, bottles in they hand
And short shirts, honies tryin' to show that slow (show that)
Lined up tryin' to get through the velvet ropes
'Cause over here when the jam drops everybody bug
Standin' on the couches like this our club
Got the Bacardi and Cristal mixed in too (yeah)
Knowin' in the morning I'm a feel the blues (uh huh)
But the jam keeps droppin' and the drinks keep comin'
And the girls keep talkin' to me (talkin' to you)
I mean shit straight poppin' everybody jumpin'
Makin' it hard for me to leave (oh)

All you gotta do is call me and I'll come runnin' to where the party at
I keep a fat sack in the backpack
Know what's happenin'
In every city I'm rappin' in
If it's a after splash I'm the last cat in
Kitty purrin' tight like virgin
Like snow, flurrin'
The party begins when the slurpin' ends (oh)
You do me, I do you
Spend a night with boo-boo
Let's have a private party for two
But it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream
Run to the border for Colombian's green
Studyin' horticulture
My green thumb keeps them water vapors twistin'
I freak until I cum
I keeps it number one

Uh oh (uh oh oh oh)
Uh oh (uh oh oh oh)
Uh oh (yo, yo R.O.C.) (uh oh oh oh)
If the party's where you're at, just let me know

Now here we go, how 'bout another shot of Henny?
I heard the apple martini happen to help plenty
Mami ven aqui, the party's over here!
But the hustlers, gangsters, thugs is over here!
Get wit' us (why?)
We true ballers like the Sixers
We all hoppin' out of sixes
Mines is black, Jermaine's is champagne
Jagged Edge in the blue, platinum, and pearl white and gray
What a sight to be seen (uh)
So So Def's the crew I thought you knew
It's a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
I mean there's nothin' like us it's true
The sun could retire if the rocks we got get any brighter
WHOA!!
Once the man and the game that I kick begins
My nickname is ESPN
Now if ya jewels is blue and ya goose is gray
Mix in the O.J. and let's party away

Yo, this lil' cat got girls
Cat got flows, roll up in the party, snuck in the back door
I don't mean no harm, I just heard it was rockin'
Let me party witcha 'til the cops come knockin'
I'm tryin' to see what all the fuss about
Bounce a little bit before they put me out
I'm like the sun - this lil' cat got beam
Got girls twenty-one wishin' they was fourteen (haha)

Bow Weezy

Young niggas in the game they was born to live
And we do what we do, we don't talk no smack
And we always know where the party at, bling (bling bling)

Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at? (J.E. y'all)

Man I rip flows, get dough everytime I rip shows
Rip hoes, when we mash out in Chevy's and fours
Niggas know they ain't heard it like this before
Whenever we pull up on the strip they like ""Oh!""
Chickens know me, hundred dollar mac and shorts
Tank tops and Polies
If it's 'bout cash, I'm gas chick, I'm on E
On e'rything
Me and Jagged, everytime we hit the club
This nigga's off the chain!
You can believe that
And if you don't, come on down here where you can see that
Anything you wanna be, best believe I be's that (oh)
Where the G's at?
Where the keys at?
Where the twenty-two's on them SUV's at?
Gotta have that from the do'
And gotta get me some mo'
Man you think I'm goin' on a groupie, no

J. on the other end, she waiting to exhale
Cop a baby L blat, do as, I'm bangin' in that back
She got pictures of me, bangin' in that back
So we gon', laze up, in my tunes
And lock up for days in a hotel room
Pull the pink thong to the West (West)
Prepare to insert billy bong in ya chest
And get full of smoke just like Chris-tian
List-en, cause I forgot to men-tion
Ain't no shit bumpin' like this one

With her girlfriend, how I bangs it in
For seven, four, O, I, L, N
Head so compellin', I'm tellin'
Every nigga that I know then I'm bailin'
Soon as I screw one, then I'm choosin'
A new one, so it's never no confusion
My solution, is distribution
One I require, this kids retire
Retails, mines, females, mines
Heartbreaks, yours, broads gettin' divorced
But of course, now if you bout what I'm bout
Then bring me dough and cook my dope in ya house

What good is all the fame if you ain't fucking the models
I see you driving, sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and ""Park""ed it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend
Like ""Girl I think my butt getting big!""

Man, I'm on a high one
Counting all my worries (Oh no, I've got none)
Counting all my monies (Oh wait, you want some) suck one

Low over my eyes, I didn't wanna talk to no-one, I was angry fast
Forward to a month ago I was in the New Era office
And they let me take what I like imagine that
I guess things do change, couldn't afford family holidays
Growing up, but today I've been on two planes
Never begged it, why you have to go making a scene
My bars go over heads like Michelangelo painting a ceiling
Life's like a motion picture, we’re blinded by Smoke ‘n’ Mirrors
And lies that were told to give a desire to go and buy
All the things we that can't afford, we're convinced that we need
I just want to be happy and not live in the street
They fucking with my chakra, I'm just tryna do me
You idolizing guys that lie and hide behind their jewelry
Their heart is empty and their soul is hollow
Living like there's no tomorrow, I know every moment's borrowed
Like a walls of sorrow (Smoke 'n' mirrors)

Am I going mad, losing my mind?
I tell myself I'm doing just fine too many times
But man are dead weight, my boy said, ""Get your head straight""
I'm like ""Brothe', you can say that again""
But I never would've imagined this chain of events
I remember when I just wanted some fame in the ends
Trying to do it all the same as my friends

I'm at the point, of no return
Caught up in this game, everybody know my name
I got, money to burn

[Ronnie Spencer]
I've been struggling, started off with nothing
Everybody know me, as the one to do thangs for free
Right now, I'm on the grind
See you got yours, I gotta get mine
See the most high, gave me a sign
He said son, it's your time

[Hook: x 2]

[Dirty]
I'm at the crossroad in my life, and baby it's do or die
Fall or floss, small or cry could mean slow suicide
On these streets scratching for my keep, grinding for my people
When you're not treated equal, it's so hard to live legal

Will my seed deceive em, to this never ending saga
Fascinated by cash cars, and clothes just like our papa
Taking mo' gambles than Pac did, in pursuit of the dolla
On the verge of crapping out, from money and power

Having big body dreams, and wood grain wishes
Trying to taste the good life, cause it looks so delicious
Man the pressure's tremendous, so I smoke on spinach
Trying to find some piece of mind, than get caught from behind

Mashing for the finish line, in this cruel millennium
Make mo' shine than lime, I'm spending more than time
Rocking pie with dimes, keep the top reclined
Use to be caught up in grind, now addicted to rhyme

Never turn my back, on what's real to me
That's my love, for my Wreckshop family
I had my share of likes, up's and down's
And thank goodness, I'm still around

Never could, make it on my own
When I'm looking in the sky, and I'm feeling so fly
But though one day, you're here
Then the next day, you're gone

[Tyte Eyez]
I'm at the point of no return, and ain't no looking back
'Cause there's ends I got to meet, big faces I got to stack
They say man'll make the money, but money'll make us move
Positions to get richer, a seven figga made dude

Calm on the cool, collecting cash flow
Keep my bidness on the low, prepared to drop my solo
The new millennium, Mr. Tyte E-Z
And if I turn my back now, then my kids won't eat

My wolf pack won't sleep, until we slay all prey
Get vicious without perdition in this Y2K
This feddy is in my vision, in this hectic paper chase
Wrecking my lyrical weapon, pimp the pen at a steady pace

Appreciate God pressing, no cases and no bars
Frauds and changed faces, but my game's up to par
A ghetto shooting star, and I ain't trying to go back
To the guns and the slums, and the jacks or the crack

Mas quando foi para escola, não podia mais ficar
Então ela partiu

Por alguém assim pro resto da vida

Da sua arte de sobreviver, desse seu jeito de sobreviver
Me diz então o que você fez, o que você fez
Da sua arte de sobreviver, desse seu jeito de sobreviver

Ela não sabia o que é o amor
Ela não sabia mas
Pensou em se casar ter um filho pra criar
Quis provar o que é amor

Mas teve medo de se apaixonar
Então partiu
Mas uma vez se foi, e ninguém vai esperar
Por alguém assim pro  resto da vida

Me diz então o que você fez o  que você fez
Da sua arte de sobreviver, desse seu jeito de sobreviver
Me diz então o que você fez o que você fez

Ao ver alguém partir que não espera por você

And my daddy say “no no I don’t want to vote for them”

Political war

I remember when I was younger
My daddy disappeared from his friends and family
He was taken to fight a political war
Another sacrifice for the political war

ASA : And I remember they did the same in Nigeria
I remember they did the same in Liberia

I don’t want to see my people dying for political war
I don’t want to see that again, see that again, to see that

ASA  : Why are my people still dying for political war
Why do I see that again, see that again, see that?

T’as appris à promettre et à causer
Tu fais des plans sur la comète Halley

On est désolés

Sors de ma télé  

Tu nous endors tu dis qu’on est des frères
Et tant pis si tu penses le contraire
Tu dis que t’as trouvé le médicament
Le bon remède mais tu dis pas comment

Tu fais des gestes avec les bras
Tu dis qu’un jour le peuple te comprendra
Qu’il faut un chef pour montrer le chemin
Que le bonheur c’est pour demain
 
Sors de ma télé  

Tu fais de belles phrases la main sur le cœur
Mais la fin de tes phrases on la connaît par cœur
On pourrait même si tu laisses ta place
Faire le discours à ta place

Tu dis Afrique pour être sûr qu’on t’écoute
Tu dis Afrique après tout qu’est ce que ça coûte
Tu dis qu’à tout peuple il faut un guide
Tu dis « courage les caisses sont vides »

And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Till Brönner,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start?,1999
Till Brönner,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And there was even postage due

And then it had to be with you

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies

Till Brönner,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Like a goodbye kiss when goodbye felt so wrong.

You better run off then and make yourself scarce.

Oh, covering me in sheets so tight that I didn't move
I just laid around until the early afternoon
So now we're at the bars hypnotized
And trying hard to keep the conversation going

Trying hard to ignore the silence growing like it always does
Yeah, I know, so we better get running
And all your thoughts, they're so tired
Your bullets won't take aim

And oh your face, it's so stern now
No we won't be scared
No we won't back down
We will sing pretty songs about love

And we will fight if that's what it takes
And we won't back down
No we won't shut our eyes and go to sleep
We will write all over your walls

And we will dance to no music at all
We will do what it takes to get through to you","The Ice Storm, Big Gust, And You",2004
Tilly and the Wall,"""Get into the groove boy you've got to prove your love to me""
Played on the radio as we drove down south to see our families
You were lying there in the passenger chair sound asleep
I could recall a time when evenings were bright and thick with love
And all the city streets and their lights they were so mysterious
Oh life it was so wonderful it would shine just like fire
How we sat on the backs of our cars and laughed into the morning
I thought you'd come and go
I never thought you would stay
And I'm sorry if I tried to push you away
But the edges they fold and you suddenly find you are buried beneath
A blanket of snow you had no idea was even falling
Now you're sitting on a ouch inside your home feeling cold
Mothing is clear, all your thoughts they have become so hard to find
With a question mark always slumped at the end of these awkward lines
All the simple words we loved to speak are no longer audible
And I never thought with you and I this would be possible
I can feel the world coming apart
And I need you by my side with your delicate heart
So please don't leave me no don't you run
Don't be frightened by the storm so bold and brave
Just let it rain",Let It Rain,2004
Tilly and the Wall,"Well the high school kids are all fucked up
Touching each other, oh my god
Yeah 40 ounces is never enough
We want to pass out in your yard, we want to pass out

Dressing in drag your best friend's clothes
While boys kiss boys in motel rooms
Well just when we thought we were no longer lost
They kicked us out into the dirty streets of atlanta

So its Friday night down on north avenue
Where the gas station parking lot prostitutes
Try to fix their hair in the rear-view mirrors
You know we're just trying to get to the club
And shake our asses

A caravan of kids, a big old mess
On the old wooden dock, yeah we're bored to death
Got a bottle of wine and a fresh pack of smokes
We're gonna end up screaming about some midnight garage sale

So god, put down your gun can't you see we're dead?
God, put down your hand I'm not listening
But the microphone cut off, so we're screaming at the top of our lungs
You were born so fresh, a golden prize

Until you screamed at me and quickly realized
That you're lost in a fog on the way to death
Oh, a big black line, a thick black line
So you better speak up and raise that voice

Come on, scream out all you girls and boys
Let's get wild! wild! wild! its a choice
Come on, come on
I want to hear that fucking noise!

Oh, the push and pull of everything
Oh, this nightmare of electricity

Oh, I heard he caught you on a dark highway
Oh, the cracks in the board they just cooled into a storm
But I could still hear the sound of the rolling thunder
Thunder!

I just don't know 
By the kitchen sink you talked to me 

Saying, ""I don't remember""

There's no cold can make us want to stay at home
Every doubt in turn explodes

We all could pass right through
We all have nothing left to lose
It's not the fire, nor the warm drink that heats my hearts
And lifts my heavy legs

Your strong hand has kept me here
No I will not go, no I will not say goodnight
I was told this town's so small it would not grow
I was told that here I would feel alone

There's no cold no snow can make us lose our souls

I don't want to climb those stairs and go to bed

'Cause the attraction's always high

You turned it on, you turned it out, it all felt off
That's how it is, that's how it was
You searched it all so well, underwater in a well
You smeared on cool lips while checking off a checked off list
The situation's never kind, feathering a dance-hall stride
You're playing with the craziest locomotive
You broke your fingers in the climb
Scuffed the ball, you're pretty shy

When we're with all our friends, we will drink and laugh
When we're driving in our cars, we will sing
If you're lost and you look, you will find me
But what I couldn't do is figure out how you
You jumped into my heart, now I couldn't start
To think of life without you, my world would stop
And fall down again, all black and blue again
I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do
So let's drive through the night
When you show me your world, I just smiled
And then I sit with you now, I can remember
That when we forget about everything that hurts us
How nothing in the world seems to be 
‘Cause nothing can hurt us
And now listen when we felt alright with it
A beauty so strange, something you didn't expect
It's a unique find that only some people get
And you are mine
‘Cause I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do
So let's drive through the night
With your hands on my heart
Spray paint glasses on a cool blue lawn
Write our names in the burning sand
Or just snowflakes around inside our hands

What makes you feel alive?

I called you on the phone, no answer there
So I laid and stared, listening to sad love songs
I drifted far away, far past the forecast grey
That's got me falling down, my live it's falling
Oh yeah, it's falling down
Long afternoon, washed twilight hue
The moon comes bleeding through, and on an olive couch
I focused on, palm lines that cracked in two
My predicted funeral day, a booked band and cast parade
That's got me falling down, my love it's falling
Oh yeah it's falling down
A sleepless night, happens every time
Oh the lights they just won't dim
And the comforters never comfortable
I roll and keep rolling, I wish I could just fade
Into the nighttime waves, and they have me falling down
And they got me falling, oh yeah I'm falling down,
When are you going to get back up?

Tilly and the Wall,"There's a boy I know he has a heart of glass
It is gold inside but it has crystalized
It is beautiful but in it's tragedy
It is hard to hold without shattering
He calls himself at night, in soft overchords

Keeps coming back to it his voice in echo chords
Till the sound's so thick it turns the sky to smoke
And the greyest days the predictions told
But this boy I know, he is pure of soul
Just get's lost sometimes in his chemicals
Under a coat of night, it's oh-so-comforting
And that first breaking light becomes his enemy

He calls so late tonight, it is 4 a.m.
He is drunk, he can't find his apartment
I don't like how it feels when I think of him
All hooded in black, also stumbling
The days start to fade out of the frame
Like the blurring end to someone else's name
You try your hardest to do what it takes
But you're prepared everyday
To make the same mistakes
Step out of that life
It's nowhere near your time
Just remember you called it all bullshit
Well, it isn't if you stop giving into it
You can walk away the freest man

There's a boy I know lives in a bell jar
But I've been there too, and I swear to god
If I can help you, please, you've got to tell me how
I know you've been away, and it can break you down

And woke the caveman from his endless slumber

There's a tornado spinning in the corner
And electricity flows from your hands into my bones
And my flesh turns pink with its warmth

Oh pretty love
Don't worry
With me you don't need a place to hide
So just sit real still
And the light will flood in over the hills

And now I'm walking around outside
In the springtime every thing is sprouting green
And I watched this fight occur
But only thought about lovers
Oh it's strange how this world becomes pure

And you were standing on top of tip toes
In the kitchen as the water starts to boil
And as we removed each others clothes
I thought I would sing some notes
So that maybe you would slow dance with me

Tilly and the Wall,"One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a naive son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said ""I'm done being coy!""
And the neighborhood boys started buzzing with joy
We finally had front page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The stomping guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, one called me his savior
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking color
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the color's so vibrant , the color's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, the right people dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river

Tired father at the bus stop hey bus driver take him home
Boy down at the corner store copping some smokes
In a sea of perfect stripes it's hard to stay afloat
Well the urgency
Oh man I feel it in the streets
All the people they're rhyming
They're stomping their feet

Where the shattered glass is lying always glittering
And a prostitute with money spilling out her hands

Was machst du bloß allein in dieser großen Stadt
Sitzt du grade jetzt mit deinem Cafe au l'ait und tust nem andern richtig weh
Philosophierst du übern Schnellzug und wer steigt jetzt grad bei dir ein

Tim & Mollie O'Brien,"It was over a hundred years ago in eighteen sixty-one
It was in the town of St. Louis that old Stagger Lee was born
Stagger Lee was a gambler and everybody knew his name
He made his living singing high low jack and a game

It was in the month of December on a cold and rainy night
Stagger Lee and Billy Bly got in an awful fight
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark
Barking at the two men gambling there in the dark

Chorus:
He was a bad man, talk about a bad man
Such a bad man, mean old Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee and Billy two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven and Billy swore he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy I can't let you go with that
You took all my money and my brand new Stetson hat

Stagger Lee he turned around and headed down the railroad track
Told Billy you better be gone from here by the time that I get back
Stagger Lee he went on home and he loaded his forty-four
Said I'm going to the bar room to pay a debt I owe

Chorus

Stag went down to the bar room and then stood on the bar room floor
And said nobody move and then he drew his blue steel forty-four
Billy cried oh Stag oh Stag oh please don't take my life
I got two little children and a darling lovin' wife

Stag said bless your children said goddamn your wife
You took my magic Stetson now I'm gonna take your life
Stagger Lee shot the bullet killed Billy oh so fast
Went straight through the heart, then it broke that looking glass

Chorus

I never saw a sight before like the one when the smoke did clear
Billy was lying in a pool of whiskey, diamonds, blood, and beer
Stag had a magic Stetson but I guess it lost its power
Cause they took him to the gallows to await his final hour

I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her. 
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I 
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my 
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name

[Chorus: x2]
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you,
Can we have a conversation? 
The night is young, Girl 
Give me a chance

She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while 
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her 
A drink she turned me down flat she said ""If you want my name 
You gotta do better than that."" I said, ""Okay, now your shit 
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink."" 
As I began to walk away she said ""I'm sorry for reals, but every 
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each 
And everyone would lie to you"" I said ""I understand but that's 
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but 
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I 
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want."" 
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
[Chorus: x2]

Lets go!

She said I want a man with the plan and ambition not an immature,
On a., get mission. I'm too good but that I have so much to offer.
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. ""You got 
Goals?"" that's what she asked, ""Yeah, I want to fill my home with 
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming 
After."" She said ""Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper"". ""I do 
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love 
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough 
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk  on the street? 
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get 
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends 'til 
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz.

sonst wirst du dem Boden gleich gemacht

Jedes Wort wird auf die Goldwaage gelegt 
ich prüfe jeden deiner Schritte 
solang du dich im Kreis bewegst
Versuch’ ich dich ins rechte Licht zu drehen
Halt’ dir den spiegel vor’s Gesicht 
das wird nicht angenehm

Vieles wirst du sicher bereuen 
doch dafür ist es zu spät

Du fällst, du fällst 
und du darfst dich nicht beschweren",Albtraum,2013

Du bist so müde
Siehst wie deine zeit zerinnt
Und die zeiger zurück zu drehn

Und deine beine tragen dich nicht mehr überall hin
Wenn du mich lässt
Führ ich dich aus diesem labyrinth
Dahin wo alle glücklich sind

Wir halten daran fest

So hard to describe 
Your harbour so small 
The ocean so wide 
Spin the wheel, spin the wheel 
Go wherever she spins 
Surrender to this wave that's rolling in 

Homing fingers 
Starting to dig 
Raising expectations 
Lifting the lid 
There's a show going down 
Going deeper within 
I long to lose myself 
Inside your skin 

What a feeling under the stars 
My body's rotating from venus through mars 
There's a war going on 
Between my head and my heart 
I wonder how they grew so far apart 

I'm so shaken, about to explode 
The myth of kissing princes 
Is they turn into toads 
There's a war going on 
Between the sun and the moon 
Before they come to terms
We'll be consumed 

Oh my god, please take me now 
I'm ready for ascension 
If I only knew how 
Give me wings give me wings 
Now I'm stuck on the ground 
Recieve this blood and bones 
I'm homeward bound 

See the statue growing wings

Until he conceived

Tim Booth,"Words are just signs, not the situation
Hopes and simple truth is poking through
I can’t stand this separation
Someone’s drawing guns on my cartoons

We’ve been taught how to read the world
But everyone’s got blinkers on
No two people read the same situation
God’s got better things to do

Holidays are full
Sunshine beautiful
Now the day appears
Sunrise beautiful

Summer turns into the fall
Try to understand it all
I’ll become a bum
Someone’s gonna hold you to your words

Winter snows into the spring
Understanding’s not the thing
I’m a dinosaur
Someone’s gonna hold you to your words

I learnt all about nothing in India
Bridging is all I’ll ever know
There’s people living in boxes
Where no one goes or even drives down slow

I wouldn’t even bother to inform you
Of this waste of human beings
Empathy won’t work with reason
Empathy’s just a common feeling

But I’m skin and bone, man
I’m been trying to pump it up with testosterone
I don’t think she likes my body

And I don’t care much for her mind
But love is a test for the damned
And the rest are all blind

I’m sending her an apple to tempt her
I’m praying that the devil will show
Cut her off at the pass to pre-empt her
Then I’ll trade her blow for blow

No one has a recipe for love like mamma
Heaven knows there is no God above like mamma
There never was a girl who was good enough for mamma
When I’m older, mamma marries me

She says, ""Hey killer, there’s a storm
At the end of every rainbow""
She says, ""Love is a test and you don’t look your best
Just go home""

I’ve an issue with the spit or swallow
And just don’t get it in my hair
Love is a test for which I never was blessed

To find her sanctuary
She won't tell her friends

Every mountain magnified
My balance is fried
I can’t even pray

When I look through the bottle
Every hue returns to grey
There’s nothing to say
So I will say it anyway

My love is a healer
Just a look can purify
A hard loving heart
I’ve swallowed too much life

Then why must I leave her?
I can’t stop the moving on
Can’t stay with the one
Too much appetite

I want you to love me so hard
I want you to love so I can’t stop

Oh baby, won't you stay mine
Your lovin' makes me feel so fine
And someday baby you'll find
My love was gentle and kind

Someday you'll know that leaving me was wrong
But don't bother all that time is gone

And it happens every time
Now I know it's not worth the tryin'
So baby, don't turn around
Let my tears fall to the ground

If she'd only be as true as I am
And listen to my love that's sayin'
",It Happens Every Time,1966
Tim Buckley,"She is the day that gives me time to live and ???? love my life.
Till night comes on with sundown scythe to end the puzzle pantomime.
She is a day of love. 

She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.

She is the bridge on which I wait to watch the river 'neath me flow.
All spinning, surging far below
???? ???? ?????
She is a bridge of love.

She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.

She is the air I breathe ?????
Awake, asleep in ??? calm.
A wind to wash my lifted palm,
A sky that calls me out to dance.
She is the air of love.

She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.

She is the smile that keeps me warm with matchless laughter, eyes ablaze.
A mischief mystery she plays upon the flute of early morn.
She is a smile of love.

She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.",She Is,1966
Tim Buckley,"When I sing I can't bring everything on the wing
Flying down from dizzy air
To the ground because I care
You will be love and your love will live

When I smile I beguile all the while every mile
As I walk across the sky
Of the clockwork of your eye
You will be love and your love will live

Casting spells from the well I can tell you the bells
Listen to my magic voice
Learn the tune of children's toys
You will be love and your love will live

When I die do not cry hear my sigh passing by
After I have turned to win
I will try to help you then
You will be love and your love will live




",Song of the Magician,1966

And your sixteen years
You kissed me as I lay still

If I can see you never,
Then I'll sleep forever
All my lonely love to kill.",Song Slowly Song,1966
Tim Buckley,"Just for you with your open hands
Waiting for the touch of man
Clutching with your blackened gloves
You try to capture all the doves
That flee into
The forest before you

You wish to catch and cage me now
I wonder if you remember how
Hard it was to say the names
Of mirror dreams and cheated games
And on the wall
You framed your first lover

Your form intrigues me with the glow
I'll remember you I know
Though I forgot to lock the chain
Around you with a prayer for rain
To bring the call
To drive you back into my bed

Ahhh...
She turns away
Telling me to follow for a while
Ahhh...
She waits

But you only reach and taunt

One tiny word of advice
Tell you pretty women
One tiny word of advice

Just do me one favor
Won't you please understand your man

Yeah, you should've gotta wake up in the mornin'
Keep your lovin' daddy by your side
You gotta wake up in the mornin'
Keep your lovin' daddy by your side

Just do me one favor
Won't you please understand your man

Well, let me tell you, Miss Molly
Tell you 'bout my lovin' back home
I got a sweet little woman, yeah
You know that she'd never make me roam, roam

She's the only woman
That I know ever understand her man

Understand
You gotta understand
Say, you'd understand
Understand
",Understand Your Man,1966
Tim Buckley,"You came to me with fire inside
Your movements and your pride
And asking to be rescued from
The pain you had become

I tore apart the prison and I hid you in my hand
In the blue light of Christmas-time, Santa Claus was kind

I wonder if you'll ever grow
Oh far enough to throw
Away the lies of no and yes
And love my quietness

Or will you only freeze and frown and lose what you have found?
In the white light of Easter seas'n will you live again?

Today the coin is in the air
And we are here and there
And where and when have caught us in
The web of violence

I pray to all the world as one that day will bring the sun
In the scarlet light of Valentine's our paper hearts are blind
",Valentine Melody,1966
Tim Buckley,"Although you've spoken many times before
A sight of birth he leaves you by a door
And now you know he doesn't understand
And all you need is the warmth of his hand

And if he'd smile your loving blood would dance
One silent kiss leaves you in a trance
And now you know you cannot live alone
But you will find your future is unknown

One day the questions rise, on wings of chance you fly
And on that day your laughs and tears will die
And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies
And you will love when love comes your way

And when it comes there's nothing more to say
And now you know he doesn't understand
And now you know you don't need his hand
One day the questions die, on wings of chance you fly
",Wings,1966
Tim Buckley,"The singer cries for people's lies
He will sing for the day to bring him night
The circus burns in carnival flame
And for a while you won't know my name at all
But sing and dance and love for pennies and gold

The juggling clown smiles to me
And every frown we agree is glad
The nighttime comes to bring the bums
From Bowery heat to crimson streets of wine
But magic lands will never touch our sands

Your children smile in single file
They learn mistakes that others make
They see although they cannot know
The needs they'll need to have their greed grow wild
But dance and sing, for others bring the shame
And for a while you won't know my name


",Carnival Song,1967
Tim Buckley,"The antique people are down in the dungeons
Run by machines and afraid of the tax
Their heads in the grave and their hands on their eyes
Hauling their hearts around circular tracks
Pretending forever their masquerade towers
Are not really riddled with widening cracks
And I wave goodbye to iron
And smile hello to the air 

O the new children dance -- I am young
All around the balloons -- I will live
Swaying by chance -- I am strong
To the breeze from the moon -- I can give
Painting the sky -- You the strange
With the colors of sun -- Seed of day
Freely they fly -- Feel the change
As all become one -- Know the Way 

The velocity addicts explode on the highways
Ignoring the journey and moving so fast
Their nerves fall apart and they gasp but can't breathe
They run from the cops of the skeleton past
Petrified by tradition in a nightmare they stagger 

Into nowhere at all and they look up aghast
And I wave goodbye to speed
And smile hello to a rose 

O the new children play -- I am young
Under the juniper trees -- I will live
Sky blue or gray -- I am strong
They continue at ease -- I can give
Moving so slow -- You the strange
That serenely they can -- Seed of day
Gracefully grow -- Feel the change
And yes still understand -- Know the Way 

The king and the queen in their castle of billboards
Sleepwalk down the hallways dragging behind
All their possessions and transient treasures
As they go to worship the electronic shrine
On which is playing the late late commercial
In that hollowest house of the opulent blind
And I wave goodbye to Mammon
And smile hello to a stream 

O the new children buy -- I am young
All the world for a song -- I will live
Without a dime -- I am strong
To which they belong -- I can give
Nobody owns -- You the strange
Anything anywhere -- Seed of day
Everyone's grown -- Feel the change
Up so big they can share -- Know the Way 

The vaudeville generals cavort on the stage
And shatter their audience with submachine guns
And Freedom and Violence the acrobat clowns
Do a balancing act on the graves of our sons
While the tapdancing Emperor sings ""War is peace""
And Love the Magician disappears in the fun
And I wave goodbye to murder
And smile hello to the rain 

O the new children can't -- I am young
Tell a foe from a friend -- I will live
Quick to enchant -- I am strong
And so glad to extend -- I can give
Handfuls of dawn -- You the strange
To kaleidoscope men -- Seed of day
Come from beyond -- Feel the change
The Great Wall of Skin -- Know the Way 

The bloodless husbands are jesters who listen
Like sheep to the shrieks and commands of their wives
And the men who aren't men leave the women alone
See them all faking love on a bed made of knives
Afraid to discover or trust in their bodies
And in secret divorce they will never survive
And I wave goodbye to ashes
And smile hello to a girl 

O the new children kiss -- I am young
They are so proud to learn -- I will live
Womanwood bliss -- I am strong
And the manfire that burns -- I can give
Knowing no fear -- You the strange
They take off their clothes -- Seed of day
Honest and clear - Feel the change
As a river that flows - Know the Way 

The antique people are fading out slowly
Like newspapers flaming in mind suicide
Godless and sexless directionless loons
Their sham sandcastles dissolve in the tide
They put on their deathmasks and compromise daily
The new children will live for the elders have died
And I wave goodbye to America
And smile hello to the world",Goodbye and Hello,1967
Tim Buckley,"O whither has my lady wandered?
I'll search until I know I've found her

One green day she left her wings
And cut away her childhood strings
But dropping smiles along the trail
She left a trace I will not fail

O whither has my lady wandered?
I'll search until I know I've found her

When I catch my sudden maid
I'll deck her out in lace and jade
I will take her to her room
I will take her to her room

I love her upstairs, I love her downstairs
But I love my lady's chamber

O whither has my lady wandered?
I'll search until I know I've found her
",Knight-Errant,1967
Tim Buckley,"Photographs of guns and flame 
Scarlet skull and distant game
Bayonet and jungle grin
Nightmares dreamed by bleeding men
Lookouts tremble on the shore 
But no man can find the war 

Tape recorders echo scream 
Orders fly like bullet stream
Drums and cannons laugh aloud
Whistles come from ashen shroud
Leaders damn the world and roar
But no man can find the war 

Is the war across the sea?
Is the war behind the sky?
Have you each and all gone blind:
Is the war inside your mind? 

Humans weep at human death
All the talkers lose their breath
Movies paint a chaos tale
Singers see and poets wail
All the world kows the score

Tim Buckley,"If a fiddler played you a song, my love
And if I gave you a wheel
Would you spin for my heart and loneliness
Would you spin for my love 

If I gave up all of my pride for you
And only loved you for now
Would you hide my fears and never say
""Tomorrow I must go"" 

Everywhere there's rain my love
Everywhere there's fear 

If you tell me a lie I'll cry for you
Tell me of sin and I'll laugh
If you tell me of all the pain you've had
I'll never smile again 

Everywhere there's rain my love
Everywhere there's fear 

I can plainly see that our parts have changed
Our sands are shifting around

Tim Buckley,"I was just a curly-haired mountain boy
On my way
Passing through I heard a voice
Whisper good evening
I turned to a shadow
And saw her there
So all alone
She had those sad china eyes
That sang each time she smiled
Ah, but the song
It seemed to linger
So long it deepened
My love for her
Until she called me near
And then we waltzed to our heart beat
All around 
The sea was swaying
The breeze was praying 
Never to leave her alone
Alone

And with the time
So did our love

I wanna sing it high, sing it down low

Is he mama's little man?
Does he help you when he can?
Or does he ask about me?

But I never win them loud

You changed an old man filled with pity 
Back to a child again

So tell me darlin' if the feeling's wrong
Don't waste another day

Are my dreams of coming and going forever

For you to find peace in your mind
So we can love again

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning 
Broken lovelorn on your rocks,
For you sing, ""Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow:
O my heart, O my heart shies from the sorrow"" 

I am puzzled as the newborn child
I am troubled at the tide:
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Should I lie with Death my bride?
Hear me sing, ""Swim to me, Swim to me, Let me enfold you:
Here I am, Here I am, Waiting to hold you""",Song to the Siren,1970

Because you are the breeze I drift upon

Sometimes a love takes a funny turn around
Can make a paradise out of flat champagne,

Tell me who can complain;

To live in love for love,
To stay in love for love, alone",Quicksand,1973

Broken lovelorn on your rocks

Touch me not, come back tomorrow

Ain't got no heart to sell you 
Ain't got no time to tell you 
All the answers you came to hear 
I just came down from the mountain 
And now you know me when I was just a child in your heart 
I been waiting so long to say it 

I been losing but I been chosing 
I've been living on borrowed time 
Trying to pay back the debts I owe you 
Ah but I never show you why the river could be a woman 
Why the sky will ever open 
I just want to be here tonight love 

I wanna take myself a plane back home 
I got a sweet little woman oh but I'm gone now 
And I wonder what my little darling does for love 
She's walking all alone and here I'm trying to get back home 
Hey tell me is there a sadder place to be right now 
Ah but now I could here those mountains ringing all around me 

I feel it won't take too long to get through it and sing a song 
Lyrics
Ah but I don't know if my love can last, oh no 
You know I just came in on the rail 
Ah damn to keep me another shirt tail 
and I been trying to make it ever since oh love 
I got a name but mama don't you know I'm ashamed 

I been out walking now I ain't been too in much talking 
Oh Lord my heart's got too much to yield 
Yes but I bring you in now darling 
Remember when I was so strong how the liquor and women wore me down 
I'm on my knees begging oh please 

Hear the mountains ringing, hear the birds a singing 
Feel the sun shine on your hands 
Just smell the river flow well now 
I know my love is growing hear the way the children smile 
Makes you glad that you been chosing 
Which time you been losing 
Ah ain't it great being alive

Would you hide my fears and never say
Tomorrow I must go 
Everywhere there's rain my love
Everywhere there's fear

Tell me of sin and I'll laugh
If you tell me of all the pain you've had

Everywhere there's fear

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Pour me a puke cocktail and take me to the driver

Filthy brown acid rain 
Pouring down like egg chow mein 
All that's foul, all that's stained 
Breeding in my toxic brain 

And after dinner I could go for something sweet 
Revenge for all those years locked in a tree! 
I'll crush and grind all creatures great and small 
And put up parking lots and shiny shopping malls 

'Cause greedy human beings will always lend a hand 
With the destruction of this worthless jungle land 
And what a beautiful machine they have provided 
To slice a path of doom with my foul breath to guide it

In eighteen thirteen the Creeks uprose
addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now, Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows, 
so he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes

Headed back to war from the ol' home place
but Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
south to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down!

Fought single-handed through the Injun War
till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
made hisself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

that his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand
that justice was due every redskin band

Home fer the winter with his family
happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
bein' the father he wanted to be
close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came
an' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame
an' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again!

Off through the woods we're ridin' along
makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a be	'are an' twict as strong
an' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong

Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
an' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise!

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
in his heart he wanted to leave it all
an' lose himself in the forests tall
but he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign!

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind
They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
sent up to Nashville the best they could find
a fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier!

so they sent him off to Washin'ton town
with his best dress suit still his buckskins brown

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
an' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand
an' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow!

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

When he come home his politickin' done
the western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer!

He heard of Houston an' Austin so
to the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
an' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

from grassy plains to the mountain crest

Tim Deluxe,"Choose Something Like a Star
O Star (the fairest one in sight),
Say something to us we can learn by heart.

{There's one somewhere in the sky}
{There's one somewhere in the sky}
{There's one somewhere in the sky}
{There's one somewhere in the sky}

..the mob is swayed
To carry praise or blame too far,
We may choose something like a star
To stay our minds on
And be staid.

-- Original poem --

O Star (the fairest one in sight),
We grant your loftiness the right
To some obscurity of cloud --
It will not do to say of night,
Since dark is what brings out your light.
Some mystery becomes the proud.
But to be wholly taciturn
In your reserve is not allowed.

Say something to us we can learn
By heart and when alone repeat.
Say something! And it says ""I burn.""
But say with what degree of heat.
Talk Fahrenheit, talk Centigrade.
Use language we can comprehend.
Tell us what elements you blend.

It gives us strangely little aid,
But does tell something in the end.
And steadfast as Keats' Eremite,
Not even stooping from its sphere,
It asks a little of us here.
It asks of us a certain height,
So when at times the mob is swayed
To carry praise or blame too far,
We may choose something like a star
To stay our minds on and be staid.",Choose Something Like a Star,2004

Tim Dog,"Grab a pen suckas I riff, and smoke em up like a spliff
And drift and lift and sift and if
Take a whiff and sniff, cause I'm too swift
I got the gift for the mic to uplift
I take rappers and eat em like Puppy Chow
Show me your wiggie style, I do my freaky style
I drop science with metaphor twists cause I'm the mister
And I fucked your little sister
Suckas don't know what time it is
I'm aware but it's not me in the Benz
Or a poor racher's teacher, a Biz Mark tifa
But I'm the grim reaper, so watch who you sleep, uh
On the D-O-G, that's suicide for y'all that don't see
I'm sicka like a psycho, I'll play ya like a Tyco
But then I might go
On and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on, am I dope my love???
Yeah, word is born I'll wax anybody

(CHORUS
Fuck it up Dog, fuck it up dog, fuck it up dog
I'll wax anybody

Take a look around pick out a rapper not with this
He'll get ate with the motherfuckin' quickness
Take caution I'm full of precaution
I'll battle any MC, but wait there's more son
You want to step and sweat the whole set
Your boys want to jet but their ass'll get wet
Sprayin' MC's like a shower
You're bein' snapped but I got the power
Tim Dog I'm not a fess and got the best rhymes
And put that ass to rest
Suckas want to riff and say yo he's wack
I'll give him a track and send him home with a ax in his back
Cause you shouldn'ta been sleepin
Now here's a rhyme I've been keepin
Flex and do a fish check and break necks
Follow the path of Malcolm X, who's next?
Punchin' MC's in their 3rd eye
Bitches are laughin' now they're callin' you dead eye
Wearin' that fuckin' Raider hat
Giants won the Super Bowl, take that shit back
I'm so mad that I could kill a fiend
I'm puttin heads in a motherfuckin' guillotine
I'm def, don't take me lightly
Fuck Eddie Murphy, I'm rollin' with Spike Lee
""Yo Tim tell your gettin raw""
Fuck that shit I gotta rip some more
I got the hardcore rap score, elevated folklore
Nonsense to ignore, Tim Dog is called y'all
I'm simply a hardcore lyricist
Suckas get mad, they can drink my piss
You want to run in my face like you're  man?
I'll kick you in the balls like Jackie Chan
I'm for real, suckas don't know the real deal
I get fly like Remington Steel
Or James Bond, blow off your motherfuckin' right arm
God damn, cause I'm the bomb
You want to be another mony in the middle
Look at your bitch, she's really in the middle
Some one stuck the bitch up her ass, got her pregnant fast
Now she's out for class
Tim Dog and I don't really give a fuck
Tellin' MCs to come push their luck
And if you're dope come join the party

Yeah, Tim Dog is here
And there's not a rapper that can't cause fear
Cause I'm suicidal and vital with the title of a tidal
I'm strictly a dope rap idol
Dog is a name that is seldom used
But some time the name is always abused
But I'm here to comtemplate and debate the rate of hate
To set things straight
I hate rappers that think that they're better
When I'm like a Benz and you're just a Jetta
Tryin to front with the confrontable stunt
What'cha want, you want me to bust them fronts?
So step back, ease back
Pull up a chair and watch me snack
On sucka MC's want to know they're wack
Fuckin' with Dog catch a heart attack
I'll wax anybody

Tim Dog : Yeahhhh, ha hah, you have been warned
The Boogie Down boys are gonna get ya
KRS One : That's right boye, you are now jammin to the sounds of the Boogie Down
Hit em like this, hoooooooo

[Chorus:] Tim Dog (KRS-One in parenthesis)

[Verse One:] KRS-One
What does KRS and Tim Dog have in common
We both hate corny ass soft commercial rhyme
I don't sound like Phyllis Simon or the Wynans
I rock Central Park but do not mistake me for Paul Simon
I can't hear nothin but wreck, do not force me
I can't hear Fred Astaire sharin Tommy Dorsey you lost me
Pure hip-hop rhymes beats I see
Singers dressed like rappers kickin love songs you can keep
Give me the boom bap when I kick my rap
No need for background singers and dancers, fuck all that
What you see you see, what you hear you hear
When you cheer and you cheer, I'm every fresh MC's nightmare
The instrumental is fundamentally essential
When I practice I get sharp like a pencil
But the pencil's made of oak, so don't provoke
You'll get broke, whaddya take I for a joke?
I'm radical, mathematical if I have static I'll
Pick up the mic or automatic either way I won't have it
I cover the whole gamit
Mic I'll rap it leaving with your ass out like a faggot
This is a losing battle your like cattle
The sound of my name KRS makes your tail waggle
Better yet you're a snake so it rattles
I'll dice you up like you're apple, smash you into Snapple
I'm not, the one you want to battle that bad 
Or just give me your ass I'll make a shoulder bag
I bring the blade all around
By the time I'm done you'll be $2.99 a pound

[Verse Two:] Tim Dog
Coming from the butcher shop
Fuck with KRS and the Dog and get chopped
Chopped, say stopped, hah think stopped
Stop listen to the hip-hop while others slip-slop
Till they hit the tip-top now it's time to get props
Wack MC's I just tax
I'll eat tracks shit it out with Ex-Lax
Bitch ass niggaz step aside
Tenderoni rappers, means your homicide
Toyin non-believers, here's the menace side
Shit aside, come inside, you're goin on a murder ride
I'm energetical theoretical copastetical alphabetical
Hypothetical yeah that is cool, no I'm not a fool
Takin you to school, don't be late for school, fool
I'm suckin your girl while your ass in school
Fool, why bother drool, cause I'm too cool 
I'm the man with lyrics that jam
Kickin MC's in the face like Van Damme
Shazam, hot damn, thank you ma'am
Don't eat Spam or no types of ham
You thought I fell off? You're smokin somethin
You thought I was soft? You on dope or somethin
You must be on a can of dope and dog food
You actin real rude, don'tcha know I'm Tim Dog dude?
So go ahead and flex, if you got necks
But when I get the mic I get wreck
So come on, come on, come on, come on
I'll eat that ass that's word is born
Rarrrrrgh!

[Chorus:] Tim Dog (KRS-One in parenthesis)

[Verse Three:] KRS-One
Now don't say nuttin while I'm checkin ya
Causin hysteria been in more battles than America
Rap messenger, comin in quick I pick up the mizick and watch em stagger
Rip another verse and watch his body splatter
Whether you like me or not don't matter, Kris is not a actor
I'll burn your favorite rapper and leave him in stitches
Weak bitches, real renegade rap rebels rip rhymes
Ferociously, which one of these pussy MC's can go at me
So if you wish to play me like a farmer
I get calmer, chop ya ass up like Jeffrey Dahmer
My pyschopathic fantastic pathic puts you in a casket
On top of that, you can get your ass kicked
Quick, awww shit
(undecipherable)
And I got more rhymes than Madonna gets dick
And I'm the lyrical lunatic, that flips offness with the quickness
Yo I get heated like cough menthalyptus now
The micraphone I must feel it I must touch it up
Kris One and Tim Dog's come to fuck it up
Evidently I bust shots till the glock is empty
No safety, pull the trigger tip don't try to chase me
Down, chase the sound you must be buggin
This is Boogie Down, Boogie Down, Boogie Down
Boogie Down Boogie Down Produc-tions
Jump around be the one is the function
Tim Dog, why don't you show em a little somethin

[Verse Four :] Tim Dog
Baby baby um, maybe maybe um
You better run, cause you know I have a gun
Bang bang boogie, up jumps the boogie
Take that bullshit rap down the street
A skippedy be bop be bop, Scooby Doo
That bullshit's not me, that bullshit is you
I come correct, get much respect
Do some hummina hummina shit, and still get wreck
Cause I'm the Dog, the muthafuckin Dog ya hear
I'm the Dog, the muthafuckin Dog ya hear
MC's come close but never could get near
Cause I just smash, throwin keys through glass
Take his cash, whip his ass, and do a yard dash
So take your ass home, write a poem
And when you get nice, use the god damn phone
Cause I get buckwild, do some ole freestyle
And beat ya down with the turnstile
Doggie doggie bo boggie fanana fanna fo foggie
Me mi mo moggie, doggie
Rappers goin platinum doin this bullshit
I do the same shit, and make a big hit
Cause if you don't like my lyrical flow
I gotta make dough, don'tcha know, ya little ho-
Mo- sexual I bet you will
Be on the dick if it turns into a hit
But that type of shit is jumpin the fuck off
So I do the same, now I'm comin off
So don't get upset if you can't get lyrical respect
Don't get mad, get wreck

All I know, he better put some back
Robbin' the community, yo that's whack
You robbin' a Benz? You're gonna get jacked
If I was a cop I wouldn't fuck with Gotti
I'd fuck with Clinton and the congress party
If I was a cop I'd take from the rich
Give to the poor 'cause life's a bitch
If I was a cop I'd steal from the Italian
Go in the projects and unload by the batallion
If I was a cop, i'd take from you
You and you and you and you and you
'Cause bein' a cop now a days is no joke
Ya gotta be careful, ya might get smoked
People gettin' tired of playing cops games
Guilty, first thing they bash in your brains
Isn't it a shame that blacks feel the pain
And all these years ain't a damn thing changed
If I was a cop, I'd fight to strike back
Return of the Jedi, return of the black, jack
Yeah with this track I'm gettin' wicked
And all you dirty cops know where you can stick it

If I was a cop, if I was a cop, pop pop

If I was a cop I'd keep my head under block
A sucker tried to flip he'd get dropped
Bang, zoom, assume the position
If ya try ta run I got plenty ammunition
I stickin' up crooked cops like I'm down with the swat
Pop goes the nine, ya motherfuckin' swine
'Cause I'm takin' 'em out
Crooked cops is somethin' we can do without
Ya know you crooked ass crooks
The dirty motherfuckers, they just got off the hook
And all you judges on the bench
You're so fulla shit I can't stand the stench
To catch a few a them would be a plus
We'll hang them motherfuckers like they always hangin' us
'Cause if I was a cop, my people would survive
Work out like Jesse to keep peeps alive
Karim Abdul, Muhammad, and Louis Farrakhan
The ministers for the nation of Islam
Fuck Tipper Gore and what she stands for
Position when I reckon, position in the poor

'Cause Tim Dog is here
Let's get down to the nitty gritty
And talk about a bullshit city
Talking about niggaz from Compton
They're no comp and they truly ain't stomping
Tim Dog a black man's task
I'm so bad I'll whip Superman's ass
All you suckers that rif on the West Coast
I'll dis and spray your ass like a roach
Ya think you're cool wit your curls and your shades
I'll roll thick and you'll be yelling raid
One hard brother that lives in New York
Where brothers are hard and we don't have to talk
Shut your mouth before we come out stomping
Hey, yo Eazy
Fuck Compton

(Why you dissing Eazy?)
'Cause the boy ain't shit
Chew him with tobacco, an' spit him in shit
I crush Ice Cube, I'm cool wit Ice T
But NWA ain't shit to me
Dre beating on Dee from Pump it Up
Step to the Dog and get fucked up
I'm simplistic, imperialistic, idealistic
And I'm kicking ballistics
Having that gang war
We want to know what you're fighting for
Fighting over colors?
All that gang shit is for dumb muthafuckas
But you go on thinking you're hard
Come to New York and we'll see who gets robbed
Take your jeri curls, take your black hats
Take your wack lyrics and your bullshit tracks
Now you're mad and you're thinking about stomping
Well I'm from the South Bronx
Fuck Compton

Tim Dog and I'm the best from the East
And all this Compton shit must cease
So keep your eyes on the prize and
Don't jeopardize my arrive 'cause that's not wise
You really think that you can rhyme
Well come and get some of this loaded tech-nine
Bo bo bo shots are cold gunning
And you'll really be a hundred miles and running
You want to play go ride in a sleigh
I'm so large I fuck Michel le'
In the bathroom we was boning
You shoulda heard how the bitch was moaning
Do do do do dooo do do do do do do do
Shut the fuck up bitch, you can't sing
Ya sound like a kid playing on a swing (Fuck you)
I'm the man at hand to run the band
That's in command
You know who the fuck I am
Tim Dog, what's my muthafucking name
Tim Dog, that's my muthafucking game
So whether you think that I'm just a myth
That riff, the lift, the gift, the if, the fifth'
The shift, the spliff, that's in control, to hold
To fold, to bold and make an ache and take and fake
Wooh! and I'm still great

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

Tim Dup,"Comme un besoin de vouloir prendre l’air 
De s’enivrer de visages et de couleurs 
Prendre un peu le temps, un bain dans la mer 
Se sourire et se plaire, les cerisiers en fleurs 
Attendre la nuit, s’y coucher sans rien dire 
Pliés en origami, dans la pénombre des villes 
Ces faisceaux, ces lumières 
Ces échoppes, ces quartiers

D'une bombe atomique, qui foudroie, qui terrasse
Elle parcourait le monde, passe et repasse
Du mépris dans la voix, cocaïne comme seule trace

Elle n'effleurait plus la peur du vide et de la solitude
Elle se noyait dans l'opium, au triangle des Bermudes
Aussi éphémère que le turquoise au fond des piscines
Elle prenait goût à mélanger champagne-aspirine

Dans les reflets de la Seine et ses artifices de buée

Tim Dup,"Un jour on m’a dit, t’es un mec triste, qu’est ce que t’as fait pour mériter ça 
T’es plutôt né dans un cocon, loin de la misère et des combats 
Aucune espèce d’intention de me justifier 
Le bonheur ne se mesure pas qu’aux éclats de rire échangés
Pencher ses névroses sur une feuille grise de papier 
N’a pas de saveur ni on ne vit que pour sa propre identité 
Le hasard je l’emmerde j’aimerais qu’on puisse le provoquer 
Que dès le départ on ait bien tous les mêmes chances d’y arriver 
Cet amalgame des tons mineurs qui voudraient signifier ""j’me pends""
Me laisse de marbre moi je les aime, je les cajole et je les prends 

Un peu de mélancolie heureuse
Comme la douceur de la paresse
Comme une après-midi pluvieuse 
Tout le contraire de la tristesse 
Un peu de mélancolie heureuse
Comme la quiétude d’une caresse 
Comme une euthanasie joyeuse
Bien l’opposé de la détresse 

Comme une couleur pastel s’efface lentement au fusain 
Jamais trop dans la lumière, c’est la nuance qui fait le grain 
Comme cet état second après l’amour sensationnel 
La liberté qu’on peut avoir en parachute ascensionnel 
Perdu dans le vague à ne plus vraiment comprendre 
D’où vient-même cette mélodie que pour toujours on souhaite entendre

À contempler les visages qui s'épanouissent
À contempler le sien avant qu'il ne s'esquisse

Trapped in a burning down house
Then I heard you screamin' in the other room 
Tryin' to catch that roustabout
Breakin' lamps and tippin' over tables
Rubbin' your big knees to the bone
I heard an ashtray fly when he said goodbye
I was adreamin' I was still at home

So I jumped a couple trucks goin' southbound
Tucked the money in the toe of my boot
Left my bills in the bottom of the chimney and made off with my best friend's suit
Flyin' on down the two-lane, sittin' in the free man's zone
And then another Peterbilt turned over
It wasn't traffic it was just like home

Shotgun sleepin' and breakdown, in a ditch by the side of the road
Law man pullin' up from behind so he can keep it feelin' just like home

Finally down to Louisiana with the sweat rollin' off my head
I saw two women dancin' on the table tops and another dancin' on my bed
The room service tastes like cigarettes so I jump right back on the phone
They said, ""The woman you with is late for work""
I said, ""God dammit this is just like home""
It was just like home

Head on out California way
Stop and take a few jobs to go
I like to quit right after first payday 
Before my footsteps get too slow
And as I'm leavin' town I hit my best girl's house 
And hit 'er up for a travelin' loan
They just roll their eyes and peel me off a few fives
Slam the door baby like home
Just like home

Movie stars and drag queens are draggin' me to the poor farm
I guess you better go now and leave me alone so we can keep it feelin' just like home

Now I kick back east from LA to catch the strangers' blues at home
In two dozen hours I'll be pushin' up flowers after I walk back through that door

I wash her dishes at night
Together we are something
Together always fighting like lovers

You know every single day we love and hate each other 
I am sane 'cause I told myself so
Quite sane as I watch her walk around the bar
She buys my friends drinks because they love and love to drink
She is weak or at least she tells them so
She is tired of letting me spend the night
And when I look into her eye she tells me go and get a life
So I kill myself each and every night hey, hey

Or maybe what I want is what you hate
And what you hate more is all of your friends

if this game should ever end 
Then I will know that it's time for bed
But you don't sleep tight when you've been alone too long
So turn to me now and rest your face in my hand
Because even they, they will never really know
What does sink and what does float

Have all arrived too soon

They can't do what you've done
They can't do what you've done
They can't do what you've done
They can't do what you've done

There's a poet in the bathroom
And he's boring everyone
Newspaper reporters
Spoiling all the fun

With their lies and crimes
And piles of rhymes
That don't help anyone

You can't do what you've done
You can't do what you've done
You can't do what you've done
You can't do what you've done

What you've done
What you've done

I heard you were in the neighbourhood
I've been a long time on the skids
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river

When it long ran over you
This is for you standing up to a bone-chilling wind
This is for the failures you collected from my sin
And this is for your lonesome tears I never dried

This is for you hanging in in the hope that it never dies
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river
When it long ran over you
This is for you waiting up though the call never came

For the milk of human kindnesses you collected from our dream
And this is for your lonesome tears I never dried
This is for you hanging in in the hope that it never died
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river

When it long ran over you
And now I'm running here beside you
And now I'm running here beside you
This is for the traveler on a blinding desert road

Good fortune smile upon you and may love be your only load
And this is for the only one who could quell my burning rage
To anyone whose been a broken man and anyone seen better days

And giving the world more than it gave you.

And it hasn't been very kind to you.

Is this your meal, Jackie Brown?

And the bathroom out back.

Himself out.

They tore down the cursed wall
