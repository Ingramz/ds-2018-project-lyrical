Rose Royce,"She's a bad mother funker
She's a human sex machine
She's a bad mother funker
She got the power to make you shake your rump
Do the bug

The latest dance craze these days
Is a dance called the rock
I understand you do it by going
From side to side, is that right?

Then there's the disco craze
That's got the world partying for days
But my specialty and my preference
Is a thing called funk

I can funk you to your knees
Oh, hallelujah, baby
I can make you say pretty please

Release me from this funky spell you got me under
I've even been called the eighth wonder of the world
Tell 'em y'all

She's a bad mother funker
Bad mother funker, y'all
She's a human sex machine
She's a bad mother funker
She got the power to make you shake your rump
Do the bug

I'm cool
Everything I do is with an attitude
I'm whatever it takes to get over

I can be Miss A-ditty
Or I can be nitty gritty
It all depends on what I want to do

I can funk you to your knees
Oh, hallelujah, baby
I can make you say pretty please

Release me from this funky spell you got me under
I've even been called the eighth wonder of the world

Bad mother funker, y'all

She's a bad mother funker, oh, yeah
She got the power to make you shake your rump

How 'bout a hand for my band

Oh, she's a funky, funky mother funker
I'm an entertainer supreme
That's what they mean
Oh, she's the belle of the ball

She's a bad mother funker
Bad mother funker, y'all
She got the power to make you shake your rump
Do the bug

The clothes I wear are simply marvelous
Gorgeous and supreme
My wardrobe is simply every entertainer's dream

I'm not one to brag, but I am super bad
I'm sore to the bone
Beware, fellas, I'll wreck your happy home

I'll funk you to your knees
Oh, it that a promise, baby?
I can make you say, pretty please
Oh, take me, baby, I know

Release me from this funky spell you got me under
I've even been called the eighth wonder of the world

Hey, yeah

What's the sense in runnin'?
You can't get away
Go back to bed, pull the covers over your head
That will make your problems go away

To hide in a bottle?
Since when has drinkin' helped your thinkin'?
Think about it

You can't run from yourself
It's an impossibility
You can't run from yourself
Face up to reality

Do you not like who you are?
Did I hear you say you wish you were a star?
Well, stars have problems too
The same as me and you

So climb into your smoke
Ha, ha, that's a joke
'Cause when that air clears
Your problems will still be there

You can't run from yourself
It's an impossibility
You can't run from yourself
Face up to reality

Come on with it
A-one more time
I wanna go higher

I'm just tellin' you the truth
Don't get me wrong
I do things too
Now listen

This is your life and time
Why must you be blind?
Stop takin' on losin' prescribed pills
They can't kill your ills

One pill takes you up
The other pill brings you down
Don't you think it's time, my friend
To get off that merry-go-round?
I'm with him

You can't run from yourself

Even flown in the big bird in the sky looking down from heaven's den
And as I go from town to town drifting like the wind
Loneliness is my company and hope is my friend

And I wonder where you are tonight

They said you wanted to be a star and see the big city lights
So you jumped in the car with your guitar, promised you're always right
I hear your songs on the radio, your big publicity
And all that we had, boy, is drifting in the wind

And I wonder where you are tonight

Wish I never said goodbye
I just can't stand these lonely, lonely nights
Sometimes I break down and I cry
I'm just drifting in the wind, looking for a friend

Sailed over the ocean and I've traveled many, many lands
No matter how far I try to slip away, my heart just won't let me win
All those memory of you and me just linger in my mind
And I, I just can't forget you, boy, and this feeling we left behind

And it's ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever 
Gonna let you go once I get my hands on you 
Ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever 
Gonna let you go I hope you feel the same way too 

But when I go to bed at night I hold my pillow tight 
Pretending that it's you, if I had one wish 
And wishes came true I wish to be able to say these words to you 

Ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever 
Gonna let you go once I get my hands on you 
Ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever

Rose Royce,"Golden touch
It happens every time your lips touch mine
There's a feeling that's so divine
There's magic in you

Golden touch
I wasn't very strong till you came along
You made me realize that by your side, boy
Is where I belong

Golden touch
There's a kind of magic in the air
Whenever you are near
I get butterflies every time your eyes meet mine

You opened up so many doors
And I was so very, very insecure
You made me see the light
You made my life sunny and bright
And you, you, I worship and adore you

Golden touch
Tell me do you ever wonder
How the stars got in my eyes
Well, you put them there, ooh yeah

And golden touch
Do you know the power you possess
You're the key to my happiness
I must confess you're simply magic

Touch me, touch me
It feels so good when you touch me
Please touch me
So please touch me

They tried to change what I believed
By breakin' my very will to live

I got a million words, that my mouth has just got to say

There's so much heartache and pain
And I know that there's times that it seems so futile

You think that you'll never get a break
But if you let yourself be ruled by these downers
You'll be making such a bad mistake

It's gonna work itself out

Well I hear in the news nearly every day
That some new war has begun
And it's so sad thinking that desperate men
Gotta make their way with a gun

And they spray the air with insecticides
Bending mind body and limb
And although it's cruel, we'd all be fools
If we thought we'd have to give in

[Chorus: x2]

Well I know there's no use sittin' around
Cryin' over what's been done
Because there's no solution, and givin' up now
The race can still be won

And with a little hard work and determination
You know that you're gonna pull through
So don't ask for nothin', don't look to no one

I was scarred Scarred for life

I spent some time a guest of the state 
I got out and wanted to go straight 
People don't forgive, the police force don't forget 
I was jailed for crimes I did not commit 
I was scarred, I was scarred

I fought tooth and nail, every inch of the way 
I got scars...to prove it 
I was in love for keeps that time 
But rock'n'roll was still on my mind

Where the smokestacks scrape the air
And gangs of short haired boys roam the streets
Get out of there way, 'cause there out to get there share

Now Butcher, he was the leader
Had a reputation for being tough but fair
He knew life was just a gamble
So he lived from day to day without a care

Stick around and I'll tell ya
About Butcher and Fast Eddy

Across the river lived Fast Eddy
He was known to be treacherous, very mean
Even Eddy's sweet young sister out on the streets
Just a girl, barely fifteen

Now Fast Eddy, he led the rival gang
And he claimed he was better...than most
One day I'm gonna fix that Butcher
Always seemed to be this cocky braggart's boast

There's only the quick and the dead
I want to know who's layin' down

Now, I'm gonna win this fight said Eddy
Yeah 'cause I'm gonna take a knife, and I'm gonna take a gun
But Butcher, he told his mates as they gathered 'round
I got two good fists, and you know I never
Never ever ever been afraid of anyone

And it came the night, at last for their meeting
I can't lose said Eddy, 'cause I'm the best
But the cold light of morning found Eddy
His own switchblade knife buried deep in his chest!

Yeah that's it all Oh wow Butcher, and Fast Eddy
Yeah that's it all

And the law never did touch Butcher
And I'm so glad, 'cause I know so well
He was a born with a wild free spirit, and he never
He never was the kind to live locked up in some dirty stinkin' cell

And the kids, they still talk about it
In the back streets and alleyways around town
They still talk about that cold, windy Saturday night
That old Butcher ya know, he put Fast Eddy down",The Butcher & Fast Eddy,1998

Rose Warren-Green,"You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

Rose Warren-Green,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin all alone

Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of skirts ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said""what's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts step back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooh I like your size""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,""
""would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the east side motel

I'm tweaking
Onto a whole new level
G-Funk
Stept towards
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level
The rythmn is the base and the base is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rythmn is life
And life is rythmn
If you know like I know
You don't want to step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate",Regulate,2003
Rose Warren-Green,"Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them
Friends, how many of us have them

Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust, honesty and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
But my friendship with niggas always ends up as bulshit
I listen to my momma though
She always tried to prepare me
Byt how could she do what I
I mean I'm do or die
But my life on the streets
That shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
I'm mashin' with the click 2-1-3 that is
They my homeboys ever since kids-
Real friends to the end

Hangin' out with my homies and I'm feelin' just fine
I've been ponderin' lately
A lot of different things on my mind
It seems lately my friends list
Done took a slight decline
And if you wanna know the truth man, man
Them wasn't no friends of mine

You jackin' me up, you takin' my cash
All my life L-B-C, for my city I mash
All those OGs and BGs and wannabies and L-O-Cs
The only friends I got is my 2-1-3s
That's my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E
I can't forget about my nigga H to the Deezy
Pressure and strikes
Don't wann take no lives
But these jaws, cracks and hood cracks
Will make you break bizacks
""Whussup homie, can I borrow some cash?""
Last week I agve you 500, so kiss my ass
I got a baby to feed
A familly to see through
And shake busta snitches tweekin' like you
Homies and friends that's what they for
Stayin' tight and money right
And bustin' with a 44

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom-covered lane?

Haven't you heard the music of the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will-o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Summer journeys to Niag'ra
And to other places aggra-
vate all our cares.
We'll save our fares;

I've a cozy little flat in
What is known as old Manhattan,
We'll settle down
Right here in town.

CHORUS 1

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through the Zoo.

It's very fancy
On old Delancey
Street you know.
The subway charms us so,
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro.

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by.

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 2

We'll go to Greenwich,
Where modern men itch
To be free,
And Bowling Green you'll see with me.

We'll bathe at Brighton,
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in,
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin,

Fin to fin.

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica
Bay with you,
And fair Canarsie's Lakes we'll view.

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 3

We'll go to Yonkers,
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear, in Childs'.

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny
On a roll,
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole,
Soul to soul.

And South Pacific
Is a terrific
Show they say,
We both may see it close some day.

The city's clamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 4

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too,
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue.

As black as onyx
We'll find the Bronix
Park Express,
Our Flatbush flat, I guess,
Will be a great success,
More or less.

A short vacation
On Inspiration
Point we'll spend,
And in the station house we'll end.

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.

Rosemary Clooney,"Since I took a left and moved out to the coast
From time to time I find myself engrossed
With other erstwhile denizens of the Apple

While we sit around and take L.A. to task
There's a question someone's bound to ask
And with this complex matter we must grapple

Do you miss New York? The anger, the action
Does your laid back lifestyle
Lack a certain satisfaction?

Do you ever burn to pack up and return
To the thick of it, or are you really sick of it?
As you always say

Do you miss the pace? The rat race, a racket
If you had to face it now
Do you still think you could hack it?

When you're back in town for a quick look around
How is it? Does it seem like home
Or just another nice place to visit?

And were those halcyon days
Just a youthful phase you outgrew?
Tell me, do you miss New York?
Do you miss New York?

Do you miss the strain, the traffic, the tension?
Do you view your new terrain
With a touch of condescension on this quiet street?

Is it really as sweet as it seems out here?
Do you dream your dreams out here or is that passé?
Do you miss the scene? The frenzy, the faces

And did you trade the whole parade
For a pair of parking places?
If you had the choice would you still choose to do it all again?

Do you find yourself standing in line to see Annie Hall again?
And do you ever run into that someone who used to be you?
Tell me, do you miss New York? Me too

Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green

As a Paul Swan, you are not so hot yourself.

I love your funny face, 
Your sunny, funny face; 
You can't repair it,

That sunny, funny face; 
Thought it upsets one, in time, it gets one

Have personality for two. 
Those eyes! Those nose! Those cheek! 
Won't make a movie sheikh, 
But though you're not patootie, 
For worlds I'd not replace 
Your sunny, funny face. 

I love your funny face, 
Your sunny, funny face; 
You never bother 
About your father. 
Have you no shame? 
You're just a mutt and nothing but!

You'll never be for sale.

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted “On Dasher” and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!”

There lived three bears
One was a daddy bear and one was a mamma bear
And one was a wee bear
One day when out walking
In the deep woods was stalking
Came a little gal with blonde hair

Now, her name was Goldilocks
And upon their door she knocked
But no one was there
So she walked right in and had herself a time
'Cause she didn't care
Soon she got sleepy, went to bed upstairs, when

Home, home, home came the three bears
Someone's been eating my porridge
Said the daddy bear
Someone's been eating my porridge
Said the mamma bear
Hey-bubba-rebear, said the little wee bear
Who's broken my chair?

Someone's been sleeping in my bed, said the daddy bear
Oh, someone's been sleeping in my bed, said the mamma bear
Bear-bubba-rebear, said the little wee bear
Who's broken my chair?

Just then, Goldilocks woke up
Broke up the party and beat it out there
Bye-bye, bye, bye, said the daddy bear
Goodbye, bye, said the mamma bear
Hey bubba-rebear, said the wee bear
So ends the story of the three bears

And in some far distant region,
Where human hearts are staunch and true,
I shall start my life anew.

Where I may find
there are hearts more kind
Than I leave behind.
And so, I go,

I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

On the Feast of Stephen

When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou knowst it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his masters step he trod
Where the snow lay dinted

But how do i explain
Why not too many people can see
That we are all just the same
We're all guilty

Because of all the tears
Our eyes just can't hope to see
But i don't think it's applicable to me
The beauty that surrounds them
Child, isn't it a pity

How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
The most precious thing
Without thinking anymore

Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to keep open our door
Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do i explain
Isn't it a pity
Why not too many people
Can see we're all the same

Because we cry so much
Our eyes can't, can't hope to see
That's not quite true
The beauty that surrounds them
Maybe that's why we cry
God, isn't it a pity

Lord knows it's a pity
Mankind has been so programmed
That they don't care about nothin'
That has to do with care
C-a-r-e

How we take each other's love
The most precious thing
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to keep open the door

But i understand some things take so long
But how do i explain
Why not too many people
Can see we're just the same

And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
God, isn't it a pity
The beauty that surrounds them
It's a pity

We take each other's love
Just take it for granted
Without thinking anymore
We give each other pain
And we shut every door

We take each other's minds
And we're capable of take each other's souls
We do it every day
Just to reach some financial goal
Lord, isn't it a pity, my God
Isn't it a pity, my God
And so unnecessary

Just a little time, a little care
A little note written in the air
Just the little thank you
We just forget to give back
Cause we're moving too fast
Moving too fast
Forgetting to give back

But some things take so long
And i cannot explain
The beauty that surrounds us
And we don't see it
We think things are just the same
We've been programmed that way

Isn't it a pity
If you want to feel sorry
Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us
Because of all our tears
Our eyes can't hope to see

Maybe one day at least i'll see me
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'
And till that day
Mankind don't stand a chance
Don't know nothin' about romance
Everything is plastic
Isn't it a pity

Rosemary Clooney,"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted ?On Dasher? and each reindeer?s name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
?Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!?",The Night Before Christmas Song,2003

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Dangerous rhythm.
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.
It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.

It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

Not a bad idea. 

The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.
You will find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted “On Dasher” and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!”

Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close
Sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me
Sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me
Sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before
It begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth
Sway me now

Quien sera el que me quiere a mi
Quien sera
Quien sera
Quien sera el que me de su amor

That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.
