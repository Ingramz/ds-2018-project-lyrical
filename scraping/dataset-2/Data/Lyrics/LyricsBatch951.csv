Ronan Keating,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2009
Ronan Keating,"Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now its just another show
You leave em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's loves illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well somethings lost, but somethings gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now,2009
Ronan Keating,"I wished I had you in Carrickfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
And neither have I wings to fly.
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on now like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stones as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

For I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,
A handsome rover from town to town.
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered
So come on ye young men and lay me down.",Carrickfergus,2009
Ronan Keating,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, 'cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly

Ronan Keating,"Going back to a tender age,
So full of confusion and rage,
Daddy says, ""Boys, your Mama's gone.""
There's a hand on your shoulder as you're throwing dirt,
Someone says, ""Time heals the hurt.
Little man, you got to keep on keepin' on,""
But all you want is Mama's arms.

You ride back home in a limosine,
The saddest car that you've ever seen,
Your brother can not look you in the eye.
Lightning strikes, thunder roars,
An early winter in that heart of yours,
But you swear you won't let them see you cry
'Cause all you want is Mama's arms.

The neighbors come and bring you pies,
Endless words and futile sighs,
And you run up to your room and lock the door.
And there you are in your Sunday best,
The way your Mama would have had you dressed
And you realize it doesn't matter anymore
'Cause all you want is Mama's arms.

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes.
The seasons change the young boy grows
To understand it's all part of some plan.
You used to wonder what it's all about.
Now those are questions you can do without.
You laugh them off and do the best you can
But all you want is Mama's arms.
All you want is Mama's arms.",Mama's Arms,2009
Ronan Keating,"We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And be can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die

When honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah

We caught in a trap
I Can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby:",Suspicious Minds,2009
Ronan Keating,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion-
Is nothing new
Flashback-warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time",Time After Time,2009
Ronan Keating,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflecting Vincent's eyes of China blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hands

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
A silver thorn on a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will",Vincent,2009
Ronan Keating,"Oh, the summer time is coming,
And the trees are sweetly blooming,
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the purple heather.
Will you go, lassie, will you go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather,
Will you go, lassie, go?

I will build my love a bower
By yon clear and crystal fountain,
And all around the bower,
I'll pile flowers from the mountain.

If my true love, she won't have me,

I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather.

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather,
Will you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather,
Will you go, lassie, go?
Will you go, lassie, go?
Will you go, lassie, go?",The Wild Mountain Thyme,2009
Ronan Keating,"I'm sitting in the railway station
Got a ticket to my destination
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Silently for me",Homeward Bound,2009
Ronan Keating,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Ronan Keating,"There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got?

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting

Hold on
Don't let go

I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you

Just stay on that road in that heartbeat

Ronan Keating,"That time when we were crossin' the Atlantic
The moment now we reached the middle
You turned to me and said something romantic
'I've won the race and you're the medal'
And all the ocean liners we were passing
Are nothing on a selling whistle
And as the waves were rolling we were dancing
Like we had enough to lose a little

So sure we were contenders
So strong and willing to fight

But it's a long way down
When you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life
And though the sunshine's on
Even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
Wasted light

Spill off the port into a crowded mainstream
Looking for somewhere to settle
Soon enough we're lost inside the mystery
We'll be strangers before night settle
With so much to say we've said too little

Back then we were pretenders
So young and ready to fight

Oh
But it's a long way down
When you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life

It's a long way down
When you're far from the ground

I'm just shaking hands with wasted time
I'm still praying you come home one night

It's coming nearer to this old town
Rich and poor, weak and strong
It's bringing mercy, it won't be long

Tears of joy, and tears of shame
Are washed forever in Jesus' name

To be washed in Heaven's rain

Lift your heads, let us return
To the mercy seat where time began
And in your eyes, I see the pain
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain

Can take a leper and let him stand
So lift your hands, they can be held
By someone greater, the great I Am

Let the distance shores rejoice
Clouds and thick darkness surround him
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne
A fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side
His lightning lights up the world
The earth sees and trembles
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord
Before the Lord of all the earth
The Heavens proclaim His righteousness
And all peoples will see His Glory

We want to see Your Glory, God
Do you want to see His Glory

Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through

Rondo Classico,"When the day is dawnin'
On a Texas Sunday mornin'
How I long to be there
With Marie who's waitin' for me there.
Ev'ry lonely city where I hang my hat
Ain't as half as pretty as where my baby's at.

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Ev'ry night I've been huggin' my pillow
Dreamin' dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weepin' like a willow
Cryin' over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me.

There's a church bell ringin'
Hear the sound of joy that it's singin'
For the sweet Maria
And the guy who's comin' to see her.
Just beyond the highway
Lies an open plain
And it keeps me goin'
Through the wind and rain.

Ronee Blakley,"[i]Momma and Daddy raised me with love and care
They sacrificed, so I could have a better share
They fed me and nursed me and sent me to school
Momma taught me how to sing, Daddy lived the Golden Rule
When I think of the children alone in play
Abandoned and wild like a fatherless child
I think of my Momma and how she could sing
Harmony with my Daddy, our laughter would ring.

CHORUS:
Down the highway, on the beaches
Just as far as memory reaches
I still hear Daddy singin' his ol' Army songs
We laugh and count horses as we drove along.
We were young then, we were together
We could bear floods and fire and bad weather

And now that I'm older, grown up on my own
I still love Momma and Daddy best, my Idaho home. 

Momma grew up on the prairies of Kansas
She was tender and sweet.
The dust and tornadoes surround her
But they left her straight up on her feet.
My Daddy grew up on his own, more or less
His Momma died when he was just eleven.
He had seven sisters to raise him.
But he dreamed of his Momma in heaven.
His Daddy drank whiskey and had a sharp eye.
He sold chicken medicine farmers would buy.
Together they hunted the fields and the farms
When his daddy died, my Daddy rested in my Momma's arms
",My Idaho Home,1975
Ronee Blakley,"I needed you, I knew I was in danger
Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure,
You let me love you till I was a failure 
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine
I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, Don't worry, don't worry, darling
You said, Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, O sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

Your sister fingers burned like iodine
And all my wanton lust was iodine
My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine",Iodine,2011
Ronee Blakley,"Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see
I said ""won't you let me see""
I said ""won't you let me see
Your naked body?""

Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said ""no you cannot see""
She said ""no you cannot see
My naked body""

So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body",Memories,2011
Ronee Blakley,"As the mist leaves no scar 
On the dark green hill 
So my body leaves no scar 
On you and never will 
Through windows in the dark 
The children come, the children go 
Like arrows with no targets 
Like shackles made of snow 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun 

As a falling leaf may rest 
A moment on the air 
So your head upon my breast 
So my hand upon your hair 

And many nights endure 
Without a moon or star 
So we will endure 
When one is gone and far 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun",True Love Leaves No Traces,2011

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

I`m no out Its not coincidence why I`m hear
Its not the lucky team who had the lucky run of cup year

You can`t buy a snatched car that jumping this hard
And bust the kind moves that cut the bone and leave you scared
It`s stolen behind the picture, taken behind the faces
Take a look around see who leeds and who chases
Advancing I don`t care how you feel just keep dancing
You heard me I jumped on extra tide and I flaw superbly
'Cause it`s coming open up the gates keep it running
Never been the once to caught your star sluming
That`s an easy way rather sail the storm then a gentle tide
I find it`s more exciting and besides I think it`s justified
That we should blow, sky dive in the logo and let the peopleknow
40 000 feat is to climb and check out the way she go
We`r gonna wait until we got it to you realize it`s a masterpiece
Treated like a prisoner whoz got no chance of a quick relase
Or realize his precious and discover the truth
And let signals be the marker point to reach for the roof

If you don`t get the bringing you don`t get the link

Clearly like neeb ears don`t come yearly
Our camp is truly one of a kind we ment sincerely
For real we know that you shold know by now
You see it`s started already you should tell by now
Exact the satisfied frends around the track
We`ve already started planning way to set the kind of rap
It`s been ready for years but see it`s all about timeing
You can`t expect to reach the top with out a little climbing
It make sense you can`t hold back with gay fence
You look tense I move on with carefull accent
And stand tall don`t want to reach one but reach all
Gotta feeling that you heard already 'cause we heard call

I've lost track of my body count
The amount is enormous
Dropped in sector four
Non-conformist intimidates
Eliminating all heads of state
The punishment is banishment
Tarnishing and vanishing
I'm runnin' shit
Titanic panicking
Manic depressant
Addicted to adolescence
At the end of the crescent
Dragon's eyes glow fluorescent
Second-guess and rest in peace
Get laced in radioactive waste that's released
Feast fit for a king
Then bring two servants
Words swervin' and curvin'
You'll get what you deservin'
It's urgent
Mad Child slice precise like a surgeon
Emergency exit's where you're headin'
Ha, forget it

As MC's slowly slip into sleep
Without bailin' with their hands up
Their homeboys act like Casey and Finnegan
Now this tends to send trends of frenzy
In to forensics
And then medics get hit
Lips spread like books of Dianetics
I'm a credit to my field of study
I, I kneel to nobody
You'll be as lucky as Lucy-Ann
If you get a word in edgewise
When it comes to being word wise 
I've got an edge
And a worldwide urge 
To rock on more wax than Verve
I'm in a class of my own 
And still throw the great curve
The great curves of a poet 
Is to run short on ideas
Works twice like two-way mirrors
My advice might slice like shears

Suffer consequences 
Intense as a prison riot
Barbed wire fences

Assassins in the entrance
Disguised as my apprentice
Nonequivalent sibilance in every sentence
Send a message up by horse 
Back to the castle, through the forests
Over the hill with no hassle
Scrolls scripted in gold
Ancient enlightenment
Wizardry and wisdom
Expressive excitement
Handsome and lonesome
The brand new heaviest
Lunacy in unison
Magnificent specimen

[Prevail]
The pinpointed path 
Through the pit and the pendulum
Hypnotic gases still whirl
On the last curl of the wind mast
And narrows in 
With Apollo and Ottomans
To cause pestilence
And rid the prominence
Of so called dominance
He and I the most decadent
With a promise of providence
I'm adamant about your iris 
Seeing the style I use
When it's evident
I compile a charge 
Like an alkaline pile
The concubines of pantomimes
More war chants and streamlined design
In the line, ligaments
With imagined figments
The tragic and epidemic rise
Of zero point five micro-pigment
Can you dig it?

She wrote about cheating.
She wrote about his wife, his kids:

He talked about the mistakes he'd made in his younger days.

He'd do what he had to.
So she moved away.

I knew that that love was still alive.

Was to certain poor Shepard's in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

Then they looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the north-west
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the kind of Israel

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
And with his blood mankind has bought

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1990
Ronnell Bright,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1990

I'm still a player, a confidential player
I'm just trying to do something right, so let me live my life
Even though I'm still hustling, I know you want to see me struggling
But at least I'm trying to do something right so let me live my life

[Tyte Eyez]
Lord knows I had my share of doing the wrong things
But a bonified player that finds the life in me
Casualties make us cry but still we got to mash
Keep my eyes up on the sparrow and mind, up on my cash

Penetrate, finish last maintain a steady pace
Keep the busters out your business and haters up out your face
In this last rat race, the lord some's got to come
Shrivel my signature I call it rapping refunds

The ones that criticize be the ones you call your friends
The ones that ride it out ain't gone always be your kin
But then, you got to know, if it's yours you gone get it
But also you got to know that everyday, ain't terrific

Precision about your plans, keep it real with your fans
Watching my baby boy grow to be a young man
My daughter got to know, from the jump you a queen
And f*** what them n****s say you tell them your daddy is a king

About the year two triple o three
Whole wide world sipping drank with me

I got money but I'm still a little stressed
I thank the lord cause you know I'm the best
A little love set with the press
Why you want less cause through this

I guess it's best for me, to stay calm
And hold it down till the day that I'm gone
I got a white cup in my palm
Feel what a peach crush Mo-Yo's just a
Player, player, player, player

[Z-Ro]
Money, the rule to all evil that's what I need
Between the hours of 3 to 7, that's when I bleed
Motherf***ers gone making the block hot, so I stay and move around
Tyte Eyez and Z-Ro stacking paper, it's going down

Break the shop of a n**** that's short stopping my change
But me and him to the fullest ducking bullets at close range
Feeling crazy, like I'm a lose my life to a b**** n****
But while I'm here I be a rich n****

Nephews and nieces, niece cool clothes and chains and pieces
I break bread with my family when my record releases
Besides skills in the west, n**** got mouths to feed
Anything against the grain just light a finger spot over seas

Saturday morning as a youngster I ain't have no bike
And I ain't have no Nikes, but in the triple I'ma have more ice
Around my neck and my wrist with fern doors

Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last

Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

Shed a couple laughs, shed some memories
Talked about the things that changed

Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts, walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once

The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green

And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay

Ronnie Aldrich,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2005

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2005

Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Ronnie Bedford,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,2002
Ronnie Bedford,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Ronnie Biggs,"Dad, what was Punkrock?

Punk was rotten, punk was vicious,
Always being unambitious
Punk was a piss-up, punk was a punch-up,
Picking your nose and chucking your lunch up
Punk was obnoxious, punk was obscene,
Having a pop at our dear Queen
Punk was a twisted tasteless trip,
Punk was a pin through her majesty's lip

We never took shit from noone, we just didn't give a fuck
If you didn't like our music, that was just your bloody hard luck

Punk was a riot, every night a rumble,
A nice bit o'blow and a nice bit o'grumble
Punk was a sleazy, punk was a slum,
Polaroid pics in bed with your mum
Punk was unhealthy, quite unclean,
It was a mockery, malignant mean
Punk was criminal, punk was a con,
And so was our favourite fugitive Ron

We never took shit from noone, we just didn't give a fuck
If you didn't like our music, that was just your bloody hard luck

Another painful day is done

And nights without you are so long

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Ronnie Cuber,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Ronnie Cuber,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Ronnie Dawson,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

We set sail from the sweet Cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the Grand City Hall in New York
'Twas a wonderful craft
She was rigged fore and aft
And oh, how the wild wind drove her
She stood several blasts
She had twenty seven masts
And they called her The Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides'
We had four million barrels of bones
We had five million hogs
six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million sides of old nanny goate tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover

There was awl Mickey Coote
Who played hard on his flute
And the ladies lined up for a set
He would tootle with skill
For each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk
He was cock of the walk
As he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance
When he took up his stance
That he sailed in The Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee
From the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk
Who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole
Who was drunk as a rule
And Fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man, Mick McCann
From the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

For a sailor its' always a bother in life
It's so lonesome by night and by day
That he longs for the shore
and a charming young whore
Who will melt all his troubles away
Oh, the noise and the rout
Swillin' poiteen and stout
For him soon the torment's over
Of the love of a maid he is never afraid
An old salt from the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years
When the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew
Was reduced down to two
Just myself and the Captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock
Oh Lord! what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around
And the poor old dog was drowned (1, 2, 3!)

A gentleman Irish mighty odd

An' to rise in the world he carried a hod

An' to send him on his way each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn

One morning Tim was rather full
His head felt heavy which made him shake
He fell off the ladder and he broke his skull
And they carried him home his corpse to wake
Well they rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And they laid him out upon the bed
With a bottle of whiskey at his feet
And a barrel of porter at his head 

Whack fol the dah will ya dance to yer partner
Around the flure yer trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you?
Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake 

Well his friends assembled at the wake
And Mrs Finnegan called for lunch
Well first they brought in tay and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and brandy punch
Then the widow Malone began to cry
""Such a lovely corpse, did you ever see,
Arrah, Tim avourneen, why did you die?""

Well Mary O'Connor took up the job
""Biddy"" says she ""you're wrong, I'm sure""
Well Biddy gave her a belt in the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor
Well civil war did then engage
T'was woman to woman and man to man

And a row and a ruction soon began

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh

We're only allowed to sing five of them, so here goes

Oh, as I went home on Monday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a horse outside the door
Where my old horse should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that horse outside the door
Where my old horse should be?"" 

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
That's a lovely sow that my mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But a saddle on a sow, sure, I never saw before

And as I went home on Tuesday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a coat behind the door 
Where my old coat should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that coat behind the door
Where my old coat should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
That's a woolen blanket that me mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But buttons on a blanket, sure, I never saw before

And as I went home on Wednesday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a pipe upon the chair
Where my old pipe should be
Well, I called my wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that pipe upon the chair 
Where my old pipe should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
That's a lovely tin-whistle, that me mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But tobacco in a tin-whistle, sure, I never saw before

And I went home on Thursday nigh
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw two boots beneath the bed
Where my old boots should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns them boots beneath the bed 
Where my old boots should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
They're two lovely geranium pots me mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But laces in geranium pots I never saw before

And as I came home on Friday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a head upon the bed
Where my old head should be
Well, I called my wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that head upon the bed
Where my old head should be?""

Ronnie Drew,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

[Chorus]
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

[Chorus]

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

[Chorus]

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

[Chorus]

And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

He's fighting off lonely, trying to drown it with a drunk

Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

Yeah, think he's still a little green
Y'all, he's fresh off the farm
Some pretty little thing put a whooping on his heart
He's walking to the left, leaning to the right
Talking to himself, putting up a fight

Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

He needs a long rope
Boys, cut him some slack
Every now and then you gotta act like that

Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll

I got a guitar banged up as I am
Hit every bar from Buffalo to Cheyenne

Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now

I simply must go, baby it’s cold outside
The answer is no, baby it’s cold outside

My brother will be there at the door, please you need to try to go slow

Or maybe just a cigarette more

I’ve got to go home, oh, baby, you’ll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, It’s up to your knees out there
You’ve really been grand, I’m feeling you touch my hand
But don’t you see
How can you do this to me?

Ronnie Dunn,"I was raised off Rural Route Three, 
Out past where the black top ends.
We'd walk to Church on Sunday mornings,
Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence.
That's where I first saw Mary,
On that roadside pickin' blackberries.
That summer I turned a corner in my soul,
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer.
It's where I found Jesus.
Where I wrecked my first car,
I tore it all to pieces.
I learned the path to Heaven,
Is full of sinners an' believers.
Learned that happiness on earth,
Ain't just for high achievers.
I've learned; I come to know,
There's life at both ends,
Of that red dirt road.

Her Daddy didn't like me much,
In my shackled up G-T-O.
Oh, I'd sneak out in the middle of the night,
Throw rocks at her bedroom window.
We'd turn out the headlights,
Drive by the moonlight.
Talk about what the future might hold,
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer.
It's where I found Jesus.
Where I wrecked my first car,
I tore it all to pieces.
I learned the path to Heaven,
Is full of sinners an' believers.

Ain't just for high achievers.
I've learned; I come to know,
There's life at both ends,
Of that red dirt road.

I went out into the world,
An' I came back in.
I lost Mary, 
Oh, I got her back again.
An' drivin' home tonight,
Feels like I've found a long-lost friend.

That it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a fading thing
Just as fickle as a feather in a stream
See, honey, I saw love, you see, it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing

See, the cage, it called, I said, come on in
I will not open myself up this way again
Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledge by some touch from his gnarled hands
You see, the cage, it called, I said, come on in
I will not open myself up this way again

You see, the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold, clean light
My feet are gold, my heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See, honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
No my heart is gold, my feet are light
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night

So some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream
O and all you folks, you come to see
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild, and my bones are steam
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free",Song For Zula,2014

I met a man who lost it all 
Ten years ago, just like the fall
He gave in and did it his way
Traded his peace for shadows and shame

Now ten years later, with scars to bare
He?s climbing back out of his pit of despair
It is no trouble for him to see
His need for a savior, His need for mercy ? cause

HE LOVES THE LIGHT
HE?S NOT ASHAMED
HE?S NOTHING TO HIDE
EVERYTHING?S CHANGED
VOICES STILL CALL HIM
BACK TO THE NIGHT
BUT HE?S STANDING STRONG NOW
CAUSE HE LOVES, HE LOVES THE LIGHT

He?s learning to dance, learning to sing
He?s seeing colors he?s never seen
You won?t hear deny who he used to be
He?s an open book for the world to read

Ronnie Gilbert,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1996

Ronnie Gilbert,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

Will surely shine you'll see

Goin' down to lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to lonesome town to cry my troubles away
In the town of broken hearts the streets are paved with regret
Maybe down in lonesome town I can learn to forget

What do you need for satisfaction

A mug of suds and a leather strop
An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop
For neatness he deserved a nod

Inconspicuous, Sweeney was
Quick and quiet and clean, he was
Back of his smile, under his word
Sweeney heard music that nobody heard

Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP 12, now, you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight

Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo

A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till when these women get the notion that they runnin' the game, huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then

Fillmoe, H.P. and Sunnydale, there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H. and Army Street, a different part of town
A different kind of freak, I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

More champagne, Mr. 4-Tay?

From day one, I had to get my money right
Me, Fly and Franky J we took a airplane flight, huh
They wanted to hear a rap, I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check

A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable

Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin' my paper chase
'cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop

So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin' 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas poppin' off at the lip

I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some Dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now, homie what you all about?

I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five, some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer

A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin' in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two Shoes, see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin' but a playa hater

I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts

So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club out there in Chicago
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?

You know they got one out there in Atlanta, the way they by choppin'
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,2004
Ronnie Jay Wheeler,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,2004
Ronnie Jay Wheeler,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,2004

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.

I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Ronnie Kole,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Ronnie Kole,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ronnie Kole,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

To reach that woman

He guarded the border
He said, ""You don't need papers,
I'll let you go,
I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes, now"".

Ronnie Milsap,"LOVE TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE
Writer Geoffrey Morgan

It's not over when you stop crying and it's the end when you say goodbye
And it's not finally done when you just walk away from someone
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
There'll be times when you're alone you'll softly speak her name
Each one's just about left you one time
Daydreaming through the glass you'll see pictures from the past
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
It's so hard to shut the door when mem'ries won't stay behind
They'll come around to remind you there's love still locked inside
So it's not over when you stop crying...

Writers Wayne Kemp - Bill Emerson

I woke up a thousand miles from home this morning
Sweaten from a bad dream that I had
I rode all night to get back home to you
I can't remember when I needed you this bad
And I got home just in time to see you leaving
And you walked out just in time to see me cry
What my eyes are seeing now I'm not believing
Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye
There he was standing right next to our roses
A half way between the door and the gate
I walk through that man just like I didn't know him
Cause after all a loser don't have much to say
And I got home just in time to see you leaving...
Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye

Writer John Schweers

I watched from the window as she slipped from the house
Once again she's leaving but Lord she's not to blame
This morning a mem'ry phoned her and he's a habit she can't break
So till she returns I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday
Once again she's chasing mem'ries and I'm losing everything
But Lord I love her so I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain
I'll pick up her pieces when he lays her down again
With love and forgiveness I'll give her reasons to stay
Then I close my eyes pretending maybe someday she'll change
And when I won't be left lonely looking out my window through the pain
The devil drove the taxi...

Or maybe it's something I shouldn't have said at all
But when I look in your eyes, I feel like we're almost one
Ah, something tells me the night's only just begun.

Is there a reason for me to ask why

Someone has taken my place
And it's something you just can't erase
It's written all over your face

You look in my eyes, you want to be strong
But you don't feel a thing when the feeling is gone

Two hearts won't always beat as one
You think you have it wrapped up
And it all comes undone

But a winning hand is rare
Two hearts don't always make a pair

Every hand you hold looks low to you
'Cause you still can't deal with what he put you through

'cause love is still the only game in town and

It's just a bed like any other it's just that you don't sleep here anymore
It's just a dream like any other that shatters when love falls apart
If's just the silence of this room that held our love that breaks my heart
(It's just a room) I tell myself each lonely night
(It's just a room) but when I say l'll be alright
It's just my heart that I'm deceiving
Cause deep inside there's no believing
It's just a room

A picture stands there on the dresser two lovers laughing arm in arm
Your fragrance lingers on my pillow and I pretend that you're not really gone
For just a moment I imagine I hear the door and you've come home
Until this empty bed reminds me that instead I live alone
(It's just a room) I tell myself...
(It's just a room) I tell myself...

Another day off my calendar

It's been one year, two months
Three weeks and four days without you
Four hundred fifty long nights of thinking about you
The lonely hours and minutes keep mounting
But who's counting?

But sometimes a game of solitaire takes all weekend
I listen to the radio or watch TV till it goes off

Spinning somewhere in space
A tiny dot in the universe
Reserved for the human race

And as our planet obeys the laws
Of gravity, nature and time
We must look to the heart to find our part
That we play in the grand design

(We're here to love)
We've all got the power

Though the stars up in heaven
Keep shining down

And it's time that we all understand
We're here to love

And all that it may possess
They count their blessings by the things that they own
Never learning that more is less

But from the moment we're born until the fading light
And all the seasons that turn in between
It's the love that you give and the hour you live
That's the measure of the life that you lead

Down in New Orleans.

Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk,
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk.

Oh, Mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done,
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

Well, I've got one foot on the platform,
The other foot on the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain.

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun,
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy,
And God, I know I'm one.",House of the Rising Sun,1990
Ronnie Milsap,"I cried a river washing your mem'ry away
And I finally made it least till you phoned me today
And I nearly hung up but teardrops destroyed my plan
You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands.

You snap your fingers and just like that I'm back in your hands
Startin' all over right back where I've always been
And I'm just beginnin' to learn some things never end

Ronnie Milsap,"The snow is on the ground.
The family's all in town, it's Christmas.
The children want to know
Why we hung the mistletoe, it's Christmas.

Then silently the night turns on a magic light
And it's Christmas all over the world.
And I hope that Santa Claus remembers every child
Because it's Christmas.

The lights upon the tree
Make delightful melody, it's Christmas.
There's a choir out in the night,
singing songs by candlelight, it's Christmas.

With every face aglow the young & old both know
It's Christmas all over the world
Love is flowing free. All the world's at peace
It's Christmas.

Ronnie Milsap,"Diesel power, eighteen wheels to rollin'
As I pull it on to the interstate
I've got thirteen hours to make my destination
And I don't want to stop to check my weight
Won't be no sleep for me tonight, no
Gotta be hittin' Tulsa by first mornin' light

[Chorus:]
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
I'm a prisoner of the highway
Imprisoned by the freedom of the road, yeah
I've run freight out of Wheeling West Virginia
And U.S. Steel from Bethlehem
And I've rolled tobacco out of the Carolinas
California winds into Birmingham
Some people work just to survive 
But up here in this cab
Is the only time I'm alive

I'm a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Imprisoned by the freedom of the road, yeah
I've got a wife livin' back in Tennessee
Ronnie, she tries to understand the way I feel (Lord, have mercy)
Now I could give my hand to another line of work
But my heart would always be behind the wheel

And presents on the tree

Ronnie Milsap,"Our paths may never cross again
Maybe my heart will never mend
But I'm glad for all the good times
Cause you've brought me so much sunshine
And love was the best it's ever been

[Chorus]
I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed loving you girl
You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile
I wouldn't trade one memory
Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world

They say that all good things must end

You've got your dreams to follow
But if I had the chance tomorrow
You know I'd do it all again

Ronnie Milsap,"Close your eyes, baby
Follow my heart
Call on the memories
Here in the dark

We'll let the magic
Take us away
Back to the feelings
We shared when they played

In the still of the night
Hold me darlin', hold me tight, oh
So real, so right
Lost in the fifties tonight

These precious hours
We know can't survive
But love's all that matters
While the past is alive

Now and for always
Till time disappears
We'll hold each other
Whenever we hear

In the still of the night
Hold me darlin', hold me tight, say
So real, so right
Lost in the fifties tonight

Oh, so right, say
Oh, so real, so right
So real, so right",Lost in the Fifties Tonight (In the Still of the Night),1992
Ronnie Milsap,"Oh, now since you've been gone I've had time to myself
I haven't even tried to find somebody else
When you told me you were leaving you know it almost came as good news
It may sound funny but it's true I think I'm better off with the blues.

Listen, I must admit that I miss you sometimes
Not a day goes by baby that you don't cross my mind
But at the same time I think of all the hell you put me through
And it's the lesser of two evils I guess I'm better off with the blues.

[Chorus]
You know someday I'm gonna wake up and these blues will be gone
And I'll forget about you and the way you did me wrong
But if you had stayed I'd be dead in my tracks
You know I still love you baby but I sho' don't want you back, no no.

Oh, tonight I'm gonna go down to the sad site of town
Sit there by myself and just start pourin' 'em down
And I'll know just what to say when someone asks about you
I'll say, yeah, we had a good time but I think I'm better off with the blues, yeah.

I said woman if I had to choose I think I'm better off with the blues, yeah",Better off With the Blues,1993
Ronnie Milsap,"I wake up with it each morning take it to bed every night
I feel it taking control when I turn out the light
Just like a lonesome coyote just like a dog on the prowl
I got this burning inside makes me wanna howl.

[Chorus]
Every move that you make is fueling the fire
Every ounce of my soul is feeling desire
From the day that I met you the first time I looked in those eyes
I felt my knees getting weak OK felt my temperature rise.

You're all I taste in my coffee you're all I dream when I sleep
You're every whisper I hear everything I can see.

[Chorus]

I want you to want me too
Can't think of nothing but bein' with you.

[Chorus]",Desire,1993
Ronnie Milsap,"Step right up now and place your bets down
Put your money on love to win
Cause there's a good chance that there'll be romance
Hey, look what just walked in.

The kinda lady who drives you crazy
Can make a man do anything
So play your cards right this could be your night
I know this time its a sure thing.

[Chorus]
Somebody's gonna get that girl (somebody)
Somebody's gonna make her happy
Somebody's gonna change her world
Someone will set her heart free
Somebody's gonna be me.

Now it's your move, what ya gotta lose
Go on and give it all you've got
'Cause when the dealin's done I'll be the lucky one
So come on step up take your best shot.

The first time I saw her I said

[Chorus: x2]",Somebody's Gonna Get That Girl,1993
Ronnie Milsap,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1993
