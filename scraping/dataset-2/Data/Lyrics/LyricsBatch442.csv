Amy Lee,"I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
I want to hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well
I want to hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you've gone away
You've gone away
You don't feel me here anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I want to hold you high, and steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I want to hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

And I don't feel right when you're gone away

Amy Lee,"Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me from me
Life's gotta always be messing with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feeling like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Amy Lee,"Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isn't any other stair quite like it
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top
So this is the stair where I always stop

Halfway up the stairs isn't up and isn't down
It isn't in the nursery, it isn't in the town
And all sorts of funny thoughts they run through my head
It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead

Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isn't any other stair quite like it
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top

Amy Lee,"Be still, my love
I will return to you
However far you feel from me
You are not alone
I will always be waiting
And I'll always be watching you
Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me

I can't let go
You're every part of me
The space between is just a dream
You will never be alone

I will always be waiting
And I'll always be watching
We are one breath apart, my love
And I'll be holding it in 'till we're together
Hear me call your name
And just speak, speak to me, speak to me, speak

I feel you rushing all through me
In these walls I still hear your heartbeat
And nothing in this world can hold me back
From waking through to you

We are one breath apart, my love
And I'll be holding it in 'till we're together
Hear me call your name
Just believe and speak, speak to me, speak to me, speak to me

Be still, my love
I will return to you","Speak to Me [From ""Voice From the Stone"" Original Motion Picture Soundt",2017

Amy MacDonald,"A poetic genius genius,
Its something I don't see,
Why would a genius be trippin on me?

And there's looking and another ,
Why he can't see is that I'm looking through his eyes,
So many lies behind his eyes.
N tell me stories from your past,
And sing me songs you wrote before.

I tell you this my Poison Prince,
You'll soon be knocking on Heaven's door.

Some kind of Poison Prince,
With your eyes in a daze.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
Your life is like a maze.

And what we all want and what we all crave,
Is an upbeat song,
So we can dance the night away.

Who said life was easy,
Who said life was fair,
Who said nobody gived a damn,
And nobody even cared.

The way you're acting now,
Like you left that all behind.
You've given up,
You've given in,
And I'm a sucker of that kind.

Some kind of Poison Prince,
With your eyes in a daze.
Some kind of Poison Prince,
Your life is like a maze.

And what we all want and what we all crave,
Is an upbeat song ,

Amy MacDonald,"A rock-n-roll dream
Hard as it seems
Is singing a song alone for you

But you left him aside
Kicked him out and swallowed your pride
And now it's all gone wrong

And you saw a photograph
And remembered the good days
And you signed an autograph
And remember the front page

Singing, ""please don't let me down,
Please don't let me down,""
Please don't let me down.""

A rock-n-roll scene, and he drank from the bottle last night
I, I tried to tell you but all you started was a fight
And you carried on writing a song and I sat there humming along
Well, now it's all gone wrong

And you saw a photograph
And remembered the good days
And you signed an autograph
And remember the front page

Singing, ""please don't let me down,
Please don't let me down,""
Please don't let me down.""

Now your days are gone
There's not a memory, not a tune, not a song
No it's all gone, oh it's long gone
No it's all gone, oh it's long gone [Repeat]

Amy MacDonald,"And the rain falls down in sheets of blue and gray.
Where did the Sun go, where's my summer's day?
And everyone's in love, oh everyone but me.
Everyone's got someplace they have to be.

And everybody's on their own every single day
They wanna tell you otherwise but don't know what to say.
And I can tell you something which I know this much is true.

And everybody earns a little less than what they say
They're all saving pennies just to last a day.
And I can tell you something which I know this much is true.

Oh she lives in a world tucked inside her head
Crying every night before she goes to bed
And he's leaving here tomorrow, or so he says
Living on his sorrow, but he'll forget tomorrow.

They wanna tell you otherwise but don't know what to say.

Amy MacDonald,"Oh the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone
Oh the girls in the queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung
And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history
And I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band start to play
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think if she gets in my way
And when the night turns to day and all the people go away
It's not the same, tell me who's to blame?
And when the stars shine so bright on the cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me

And I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care

And the drink and dance and drugs you know
It's all part of the show we go to
Maybe I should tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you

And when the night turns to day and the lights they fade away
I wish that love and life would pass me by
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
Well there is magic in the air I swear
And I wish that I saw Bowie, playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something, to make me come of age

Oh won't you take a ride with me
Through the Barrowland history
And I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And the drink and dance and drugs you know

Nothing he did would ever get in my way
But there's still a long, long way to go
I've only ever seen his face on film,
I've only ever heard the lines he'd say
But still they won't, get in my way

Never let them bring me down
Never let them tear me down

Every place and everything you do
But I'm happy to be by myself
I don't need no-one else

Amy MacDonald,"Put a ribbon round my neck and call me a libertine
I will sing you songs of dreams I used to dream
I will sail away on seas of silver and gold

I'm singing my song

Fairy tale romances every single day

And sing me songs you wrote before.

Who said life was fair,
Who said nobody gived a damn,
And nobody even cared.

The way you're acting now,
Like you left that all behind.
You've given up,
You've given in,
And I'm a sucker of that kind.

Amy MacDonald,"It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The rare old mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

Or those eyes that dazzled from about a mile away
I never smelt that sweet scent
That followed you everywhere you went
Or even had the chance to call you mine

At all the missed hours I spent
Watching my life just pass me by
Now your with somebody new
and there's nothing I can do
Just sit back and watch you smile.

And you're waiting outside jimmy's front door

And even when the sun keeps shinning down
It's dark
And even though the world keeps turning round

This time we're trying to pretend
Tonight we're all still young at heart

The brighter day of time and grace
Will light the way for your embrace
We'll open up our tired eye to see
To see

It's dark
And even though the world keeps turning round
We've stopped

Tonight we're all still young at heart
Something good will come

Listen to the sound of sirens
This is where we break this violent heart
Something good will come

Listen to the sound of sirens
This is where we break this violent heart
Something good will come

It's hard to know when you're out of control
It's hard to say that we'll never get old

Amy Millan,"Love of mine
Someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark

No blinding light
Or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school
As vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me
""Son, fear is the heart of love""
So I never went back

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me
Have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Then I'll follow you into the dark",I Will Follow You Into the Dark,2009
Amy Millan,"Later here this morning 
If the crowds hold back the rain 
I'll declare my intent 
To race again

Baby, I've done running
I've cut myself a deal
I gave myself a ladder
This time for real

And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm
Just look at me
And I've got nothing to live up to
And I've nothing to reveal

Go on, run for me
Go on, run for me
Go on, run for me

'Cause I can't take it back
Gone the summer, gone the past
And now it's gone, now it's gone

The lane is laid with ashes
My road is paved with fear
I bathed myself in sweet grass
To tame the years

And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm
Just look at me
And I've got nothing to live up to
And I've nothing to reveal

Go on, run for me
Go on, run for me
Go on, run for me

Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
And I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes and then I won't see
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then, to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

And I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't

And I try to swim to dry land
To reach the shore,
It's a desert island and I wright help,

In the sand as large as I can,
That you ignore,
So I'm waving at air planes,
Waiting for ships to come take me away,

When I noticed the tide
Sure is coming in fast,
And I guess that this song
Really could be my last,

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm stranded here with,
No-one to rescue me
Abandon by everyone I need,
I feel like you played me,
I feel like I'm such a fool,
Left stranded here by you, oh

So the quick sand is pulling me down,
You could throw that rope,
And could save me from dispare,
I was cast away you let me drown,
So I tried to scream but I bet
No-one would hear,

Put a message in a bottle
That you'll never read,
So this is the last song
That you'll get from me,

[Chorus]

So I'm waving at air planes,
Waiting for ships to come take me away,

Amy Pearson,"Always knew that when we said good bye
It wouldn't last forever
Always thought that I'd run into you
And we'd get back together
Now your here
Just like I imagined
But never once did it cross my mind
That you could move on
You've found someone
It breaks my heart
'cause you're so in love

I wish that my touch makes you smile just like that
And I wish that I had you the way that she has
'cause I still remember the love I left behind
Oh I wish I was her and you were mine

I think somebody's try'na talk to me
But I can't hear what they're saying
All I can do is stare at you
I don't even know why I'm staying
Never thought I'd cry to see you happy
It's just I thought that your happiness 
Was right here with me
I know we're through
It's no use
Still I can't help but feel

I wish that my touch
Makes you smile just like that (make you smile like that)
And I wish that I had you
The way that she has (the way that she has)
'cause I still remember the love
That I left behind (i left behind)
Oh I wish I was her and you were mine
The way that she has you (oh)
I wish that was me (i wish that was me)
There's no place on earth
That I'd rather be (rather be)
'cause I still remember the love
I left behind
Oh I wish I was her and you were mine

I used to be right beside you (oh no)
Now I'm not even kept inside your heart (oh no)
I put our love upon a shelf
But now it's gone
'cause you belong to someone else

I wish that my touch
Makes you smile just like that (i wish I was her)
And I wish that I had you 
The way that she has you (the way that she has you babe)
'cause I still remember the love 
That I left (i left oh I left behind)
Oh I wish I was her (i wish I was her)
And you were mine (oh I wish you were mine)

Amy Pearson,"Was just the other day when you said to me
That you had enough
Told me that you wanna move on with your life
And now you sing to me the same old melody
That I?m still the one
You thought I?d hang around while you made up your mind

I used to say that you were everything
You got your way but not anymore

Did you think it would be that easy
Did you think I?d be back for more
Loving you was a big mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all
Did you think I would wait forever
Baby like the others did before
Loving you was my mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all

No, I don?t I don?t I don?t miss you

So here you are today trying to manipulate
But that won?t work this time
'cause baby don?t you know you?re the last thing on my mind
Not gonna hesitate don?t wanna recreate the dreams you broke in two
So I?ll pick up the pieces of my broken heart and be done

Did you think it would be that easy
Did you think I?d be back for more
Loving you was a big mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all
Did you think I would wait forever

Loving you was my mistake 'cause I don?t miss you at all

No, I don?t I don?t I don?t miss you

No, I don?t I don?t I don?t miss you
No, I don?t I don?t I don?t need you

I gottta move on with my life

Yet in the shadows, still a light I see

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?

Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

I will see my mother,
My sister and my father,
But my brother is going to hell

Well they hung him from the gallows,
As the sun turned red from yellow
The crowd they heard him halting,
And they sighed with much relief

The preacher asked him for any last words
My brother spit onto his clean shirt,
And he smiled without redemption and said,
""This is one soul God don't need""

Though I loved him, I won't miss him,
As he's burnin' and he's twistin',
For his heartless dedication
To the devil and its creed

As a child we called him rotten,
Till he was lonely and forgotten
And he revenged our constant jeering,
With his every word and deed

Oh and for my contribution,
And the soul's lack of retribution,
I would ask the Lord's forgiveness,
On my very bended knee

And its the tale of one bad seed",Johnny Rottentail,2001

Let it ring",Let It Ring,2005
Amy Ray,"Putting pennies on the track, shiny and flat,
It was the best we could be, sexy and free
I grow away from myself with each passing bell
With all these new accessories, I just stumble and bleed

For a moment I feel the coldness
At the end of a fall day
I put my hands down deep in my pockets
As my body awakes

So I'm heading back to school all brilliant and new,
Trying hard to fit in and not to walk like a man
A girl that I never noticed asked me to hold this
A secret too hard to tell and I never will

For a moment I feel the coldness
Of everything that's been taken away
I put the phone back in the cradle,
I can't make this okay

The damage she'll survive
But damn the sacrifice of
Every life we've lost
Damn all the cost of the assault

You tied a knot and you dared me,
The stem of a cherry,
To find my own humanity
And just let it breathe

Hold my head up in this moment
Keep myself from fading away
Pull my hands out of pockets and
Feel my body awake",Pennies on the Track,2005

Kids out on the sidewalk, waiting for a ride
All the punks and the queers and the freaks and the smokers

Alright I hear what I just can't do
But I got this spark I got to feed it something 
Or put it out for good

The stadium lights were breaking through the bleachers
I spent all day pushing tissue roses into chicken wire
Hey S.G.A., I'm an overachiever of the wrong persuasion
A pep rally kid, a new gender nation with a new desire

And rub your fingers through your crew cut hair

And laugh at the faggots

Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything that you could see

I'm just a magnet for the rural faggots
They come and knock on my door
Just to find they're running out of time
To figure out what they come here for

I know you want to know the truth
And I'm the dyke who will give it to you
By this time next year
You'll know you're queer
It'll all be okay
It'll all be clear

That slowly whittle us down to nothing
It felt a lot like despair

I'm sitting with as the seasons change
It lays unclaimed sometimes

To see the forest for the trees
Truth is a villain

Or did they give me humanity?
Did they show me an autumn moon
When I needed my eyes of youth?

There's a big big love I need to be part of
I watch the leaves die while I wait
Time is unyielding

I see the days turn grey but for all our praying
We can't end this drought with rain
The gods are unwilling

Did it steal you away from me
Or did they give me humanity?

And you gotta sing in tune
Yeah you got hands to hold

With growing pains and leaky parts
All I've got's this little cup
I pour it out she fills it up
It tastes so sweet and so bitter
Why can't I just be with her?

In the time that we're apart
I figured out what makes it hard
All the words they go away
I can't face another day
Without the one who breaks my heart
And gets to touch the tender parts

Enough to fill the sky above
Enough to make the sunlight shine
Enough to leave it all behind

Receive the love that makes it better

Born of fear and forged with malice
All I've got's this coat of mail, in

It's useless now as I wither

Midnight on the golf course

Your brought your friends

Cause you thought I was easy

I wanted your love

Like a girl wants her own horse

You were looking at the moon

Man, you didn't even see me

Where are you 

On the 20th anniversary of my broken heart?



What's a girl to do

When she wants to be a woman

And she gets no help

Just a sinking feeling

With the little I knew

I couldn't see it coming

Like your skin turns brown

And then it all starts peeling

Where are you

On the 20th anniversary of my broken heart?



Now I'm sitting in the bar

Of an upscale hotel

In my old hometown

There's a guy next to me

38, 39

Too dark in here to really tell

I give him a smile

But he looks right through me

Where are you

On the 20th anniversary of my broken heart?


",20th Anniversary,1998
Amy Rigby,"I feel a little ill at ease

With how you've been treating me

I'm not some kind of disease

For you to cure, oh baby



I wake up at seven a.m.

And you're gone out the door again

And when you come back

You can't even say one kind word

And I don't want flowers or fancy things

I gave up on a diamond ring



All I want

I just want a little pat on the back from you

Not another little subtle attack from you

I just want a little something

To show me that you care whether I live or die

All I want

For you to treat me with a little respect

Not like a big pain in the neck

All I want is tell me it's alright



I feel kind of furious

and you're not even curious

You're way too oblivious

where I'm concerned, oh darling



You turn to me at night

Like you think everything's alright

And it is til we turn on the light

And real life returns

And I don't want flowers or fancy things

I gave up on a diamond ring



All I want

I just want a little hug and a kiss from you

Not a list of things I didn't do

I just want a little something

To show me that you care whether I live or die

All I want

For you to tell me that you're liking the dress I'm in

Not criticize me cause my life is a mess again

All I want is tell me it's alright


",All I Want,1998
Amy Rigby,"Some folks shop off the regular rack

Buy it, don't like it, they can take it back

We got to head for the rear of the store

Because we can't afford perfect anymore



As is, must go

Nobody has to know

As is, for less

Paying full price would be happiness



Some people dress in the latest of styles

Strut up and down the department store aisles

We make do with the dregs and the dross

Cost so cheap that the shop takes a loss



As is, must go

Nobody has to know

As is, for less

Paying full price would be happiness



How do we get so poor

Is this what we're working for

Dreaming of merchandise

That hasn't been marked down...twice

As is



The lady is rich but she's lacking in taste

All that Versace is really a waste

I'd wear the heck out of something so chic

Have to eat mac and cheese for three months and a week



As is, must go

Nobody has to know

As is, for less

Paying full price would be happiness

A little New Orleans, outside the snow was falling

Two months to Mardi Gras, it's seventeen in Buffalo

Professor Longhair, can't you hear me calling?



I've been so sick and sad

I miss my mom, I lost my dad

My life's a soap opera, it's so apalling

I wanna drive and drink, don't like the thoughts that I think

Professor Longhair, can't you hear me calling?



Maybe there's a place where I can go

Somewhere to make it all make sense

I'll find to feed the dogs

And jump the fence



Doing t'ai chi in the morning

Doesn't seem to help me

I wanna dance but I'm not fit for crawling

I've been so lonely lately, even waitresses won't date me

Professor Longhair, can't you hear me calling?



I'm out of cigarettes

Oh God, I love tobacco

Can't get out of the car cause the engine's stalling

Need sex and sympathy, the moonlight on the meadow

Professor Longhair, can't you hear me calling?


",Calling Professor Longhair,1998
Amy Rigby,"You stopped my heart

When you walked by

I thought you were the one that loved me

And made me cry

I see you're not, but that's okay

Maybe we could try it any way

For new times' sake



Excuse my haste

I know we just met

But you're reminding me of someone

I can't forget

He's in the past, you're here with me

Let's fall in love in memory

For new times' sake



Hearts connect at second glance and pay no mind to circumstance

Longing for an old romance can lead to something new



Let's fall in love in memory

For new times' sake


",For New Times' Sake,1998
Amy Rigby,"I  looked for myself in the rear view mirror

I got scared cause there was nobody there

I'm invisible, yeah invisible

I'm who I used to be but nobody sees me

I'm invisible



I walked into a bar, now what was I thinking?

Nobody asked me ""Honey, what are you drinking?""

I'm invisible, oh shit I'm invisible!

Since I hit 35, what I want I gotta buy

I'm invisible



I put some makeup on, I dress like someone half my age

I write it in a song, I even get up on the stage

I'm still invisible, well...invisible

I say to hell with my pride, I haven't got a thing to hide

Cause I'm invisible



I was standing by the ocean in my brand new bathing suit

Guy strolls up to me and tells me ""Hey your daughter's awful cute""

I'm invisible

I said ""She's cute alright, I hope your sunburn peels tonight""

I'm invisible



Now you know my story, at least I think you do

I guess you're out there, I just can't see you

Are you invisible?

You must be invisible

I know it hurts to disappear, but you've got lots of company here

And we're invisible


",Invisible,1998
Amy Rigby,"I know a lot of things

I'm through with learning

More than I need to know

There's not a whole lot left to show me



I am not innocent

I'm good at falling

It don't really hurt that much

You can't hurt what you can't touch

You can't hurt what you can't touch



And I have my grounds

To build a wall

All the way around

Build it nice and tall

I will dig my well

To fill my moat

Install warning bells

Arm with cannonballs to sink your boat



This is my fairy tale

I can do what I want

If I'm not having fun

I close the book and start another one



Yeah I like happy endings

They look good on me

I have a looking glass

Shows me only what I want to see

I only see what I want to see


",Ivory Tower,1998
Amy Rigby,"This is the last time that I try this

This is my final experiment

I no longer want to continue testing my emotions

But there's data I have not collected yet



When I see you there's a slight reaction

But of couse these monitors can lie

Nine times out of ten occurences of base attraction

Sophisticated intellects deny



I am not against the concept of romance

Reality is quite another tale

Hearts and flowers have their place

On tablecloths and bits of lace

Attempts at amour fou are doomed to fail

In my laboratory of love

Proving to myself the lack of the existence of

Laboratory of love

Laboratory of love



Would you kindly answer a few questions?

Strictly for the sake of argument

Were you to relax approximate to my location

Do you think said time would be well spent?



I admit I feel the urge to touch you

Probably a pre-programmed response

Surveys indicate our natural tendency to mate

Satifies the needs, negates the want



I cannot refute the role of mystery

Some things simply will not be explained

Chemistry does fascinate

The stroke of luck, the twist of fate

But a passive observer I remain

In my laboratory of love

Amy Rigby,"Summertime in '83

The year that we made history

But didn't have the energy

To tell a soul 'cept you and you and me

Selling off Fiesta plates

Ate loaves of bread but gained no weight

From pecan waffles on the roof

The summer of my wasted youth



Summertime in '83

The last time I took LSD

But listening to Patsy Cline

And Skeeter David really blew my mind

Played the boombox in the courtyard

Never used a credit card

Still took a trip by Greyhound bus

The summer I believed in us



Pushed plaster cows down city streets

Wore thrift store skirts with little pleats

Smoked pot and sat around all day

Bought a guitar but didn't try to play



Summertime in '83

I didn't need a j-o-b

Cause unemployment kept me free

To study country harmony

And find somebody with a car

Drink cheap beer in the Polish bar

Take photos in the photo booth

Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Like there was nothing wrong, nothing wrong

They had their lines in the water ten feet apart

Beer guts, t-shirts, me with my heavy heart

I don't have religion but I'm trying to pray

But I was cool, like hi there, how did it go?

She had chipped nail polish, writing on her hand

She was nodding her head to her favorite band

Staring into space like she was all alone

But I didn't take it personal

It meant that I was home and I said

And I wished that he would get up, make it all better

And he was looking at me asking what was wrong

I'm making trouble just to make it

Why don't I just lay back and take it

Why am I never comfortable just being comfortable?

I try to suck it up

But then I always fuck it up 



Why do I pull wings off butterflies

Look for things that hurt my eyes

I kiss the boys but I'm the one who cries

Why do I get off on misery

Loneliness feels good to me

I'm happy when I'm all hung out to dry

Why do I



I look sweet but deep inside I'm awful

I'm colder than a frozen waffle

I'm always searching for the rip in the silver lining

Here it is

I'm busy being so downtrodden

I'm just a peach that's going rotten

I wanna save the other peaches so I roll away

I'm careful where I land

Does anybody understand?

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

Cold winter mornings in a Colorado town

Amy Speace,"I still see my brother Michael, 
Pressed and polished, shaking hands down at the store
Everyone had come to see the all-star hop the greyhound bus and go to war
He punched me in the arm to say goodbye
It was the first time that I saw our father cry

I kept all my brother?s letters tied in ribbon in a box beneath my bed
Every night I read by flashlight with the covers in a tent above my head
His words said ?Not to worry, doing fine?
It was his way of trying to ease my mind
While I was trying not to read between the lines

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn?t seem fair that an innocent boy 
Should have to carry the weight of the world

Then it was football games and homecoming and 
Picking out our dresses for the prom
With my brother in some desert dodging bullets when he wasn?t dodging bombs
While we went from the land of brave and free
To just being afraid to disagree
While I was being brought down to my knees by

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn?t seem fair that an innocent boy 
Should have to carry the weight of the world

It was the middle of December when the Army sent my brother home at last
While the flagpole by the football field flew the colors half-way down the mast
The wind blew cold and snow was coming down
Still everybody turned out from our town
As we laid my brother in that frozen ground

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much was lost, so much was missed
It doesn?t seem fair that any boy or any girl
Should have to carry the weight of the world

Amy Studt,"""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

[Chorus:]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

[Chorus:]

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell ya, that your the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

Stay
And believe in emotion
Not slipping away

Fell into something much deeper than us

You should know the world and all its ways so find your place

'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son not a sob story

And your priority, it must be heard

You don't like ballers 
They don't do nothing for ya 
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller 

You're more than a fan 
Lookin' for a man 
But you end up with one-nights-stands 

He could be your whole life 
If you got past one night 
But that part never goes right 

In the morning you're vexed 
He's onto the next 
And you didn't even get no taste 

Don't be too upset 
If they call you a skank 
'cause like the news everyday you get pressed 

You don't like players 
That's what you say-a 
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire 
Or them big ballers 
Don't do nothing for ya 
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller 

You can't sit down right 
'cause you jeans are too tight 
And your lucky its ladies night 

With your big empty purse 
Every week it gets worse 
At least your breasts cost more than hers 

So you did Miami 
'cause you got there for free 
But somehow you missed the plane 

You did too much E 
Met somebody 
And spent the night getting cane 

Without girls like you 
There'd be no fun 
We'd go to the club and not see anyone 
Without girls like you 
There's no nightlife 
All those men just go home to their wives 

Don't be mad at me 
'Cause your brushing thirty 
And your old tricks no longer work 

You should have known from the job 
That you always get dumped 
So dust off your fuck me pumps",F*** Me Pumps [MJ Cole Mix][*],2003

That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding

[Chorus]
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row

She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah

And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show

Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah

At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such

Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends, right?

You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you?re home at night
But we're best friends right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?

I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right?

You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget

yours is a familliar face
but that dont make your place safe


I never thought my memory
of what we had could be intruded
but I couldnt let it be 
I needed it as much as you did

Now its not hard to understand
why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand
is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down

'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too

When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind

Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around

Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound

Bright as stars that shine up above you

Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feelin' in the mood for love?

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear

There I go talking out of my head again, baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together?

Now if there's a cloud up above us
Come on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Ooh my baby won't you please let me love you 
And give a relief from this awful misery?

I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before

I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good

It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight

You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain

Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast

Woah, oh

It's not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take put in your face
Oh my mistake, you're not a floozy
Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady's interest, I just met
The love scholar, she's the teacher's pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker

It's affecting my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG
Those fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go through it
Historically so ruthless as feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it's a dragon, it's a bastard you're in tune with, just lust
I'm through with you after my crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love

We had to hit a wall,

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
she's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
birds surround her sweet soun
and Ava flies in paradise

With dread I woke in my bed
to shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
she just stopped singing

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
she's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
birds surround her sweet soun
and Ava flies in paradise",October Song [T in the Park 2004] [Live],2012
Amy Winehouse,"Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand

Amy Winehouse,"When you walk in the bar,
And you dressed like a star,
Rockin' your f me pumps.
And the men notice you,
With your Gucci bag crew,
Can't tell who he's lookin' to.

'Cause you all look the same,
Everyone knows your name,
And that's you whole claim to fame.
Never miss a night,
'Cause your dream in life,
Is to be a footballer's wife.

You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire.
You don't like ballers,
They don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller.

You're more than a fan,
Lookin' for a man,
But you end up with one-night-stands.
He could be your whole life,
If you got past one night,
But that part never goes right.

In the morning you're vexed,
He's onto the next,
And you didn't even get no taste.
Don't be too upset,
If they call you a skank,
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed.

You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire.
Or them big ballers,
Don't do nothing for ya.
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You can't sit down right,
'Cause you jeans are too tight,
And your lucky its ladies night.
With your big empty purse,
Every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than hers.

So you did Miami,
'Cause you got there for free,
But somehow you missed the plane.
You did too much E,
Met somebody,
And spent the night getting cane.

Without girls like you,
There'd be no fun,
We'd go to the club and not see anyone.
Without girls like you,
There's no nightlife,
All those men just go home to their wives.

Don't be mad at me,
'Cause you're pushing thirty,
And your old tricks no longer work.
You should have known from the jump,
That you always get dumped,
So dust off your fuck me pumps.",Fuck Me Pumps [T In the Park 2004],2012

The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks, What's she running from?

Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses

The man that he longs to be

The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see

Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she

I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this?

You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always want to talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always want to talk it through, I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

Thought you had so many lessons to learn""
I said ""You don't know what love is get a grip

Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me

Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on
They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be","Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)",1999
Amyg,"On the lawn before the bouquet fell
Long before we heard the ringing bell
When all I want is a good look at your underside

Reading trash like it was Judy Blume
Your paperbacks are strewn about the room
Awaiting their instructions to be mobilized

And everybody knows how it shakes and how it glows
Everybody knows and so it goes

That everybody wants their shoes in the sunshine now

Lazy Rayna had a million bucks
Changed into pennies on a hundred trucks
'Cause linen?s legal tender for a layabout

Why hold your breath until your face turns blue
A stretch of rope you know can do that too
The truth be told no one likes a gadabout

And everybody knows how it shakes and how it glows
Everybody knows and so it goes

That everybody wants their shoes in the sunshine now

Amyl Justin,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

An Cafe,"Times of laughter, times of anger
So precious was our time together, my heart
Ached

Ran away from home, not a word to our 
Parents, first time living together
No money no mattresses, we cuddled up
Close

Talked until dawn, not wanting to waste 
Time sleeping

Overcame the lonely nights and the freezing
Cold
By pressing into each other's bodies
Such sweetness always by my side
Your smile always managed to erase any
Sadness

My first birthday since we started our life
Together
Both so busy, had to spend the day apart

Came back home to find an expensive 
Wallet when you had no money

Tears fell unexpectedly
Waited for you to come home so I could say
""Thank you""
My cup overflowing with tenderness
Warmth, pulling at my heart
Listening to the footsteps walking down the
Hall of the apartment
I waited with anticipation
Hearing the sound of the keys opening the
Front door
I rushed to greet you

Time to leave this place, leaving only happy
Memories behind

Times of laughter and times of anger
So precious was our time together, my heart
Ached

We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride, yeah yeah

But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well Mister they vanished right into the air

Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse

Once we sip the wine
His lips will come to mine

Will be the melody that keeps him close to me

Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

Para hacernos más felices

Ay amor, porque
No tengo el derecho
De atraparte para siempre

Y de que alguien te sienta para mí
Ay amor, quien pudiera pasarse
La vida sin llorar por ti
Ay amor, si pudiera comprarte

Tu precio seria el desamor
Ay amor, tengo miedo de repente
De que pases por enfrente
Y de no reconocerte

Ay amor, el problema
Es que nos llegas de maneras diferentes
Y hay quien ama y quien se deja amar

Ay amor, que no tienes sentimientos
Se supone que tú existes
Para hacernos más felices

Encuentras un nuevo amigo

Que rompa con los celos y el perdón
Y como lo convenzo que no es bueno
Es terco pero es mi corazón

Que fácil hoy sería darte muerte
Voltearme para no verte sufrir
Tu sientes y yo pienso diferente
Pero al final tenemos que seguir

Corremos tu y yo la misma suerte
No lates si también me muero yo
Salirte de mi pecho tu no puedes
Por que al final tu eres mi corazón

Yo como le regaño por ingenuo
Si es cómplice conmigo del dolor
Pedirle que lo olvide seria un sueño

Quien te aguanta y por amor siempre perdona
Al fin me quité la venda
Porque ahora me doy cuenta
Que eras tú tan poca cosa
Como amante ese tema está de sobra
Como quieres que te diga que me estorbas
Y que ahora yo merezco ser feliz

",No Me Voy Sin Bailar (When I Get Low I Get High),1994
Ana Belén,"Con esa forma extraña 
Que tienes de decir 
Las cosas más normales 
Para hacerme reír 
Con esa boca que es el mejor sitio 
Para perderse un rato. 

Con esa cara guapa 
De Arcángel San Gabriel 
Why esa mirada vaga 
Que acaricia la piel 
Con ese andar flexible why silencioso 
Que recuerda al de un gato 
Why esa expresión que tienes cuando quieres 
Del que nunca en su vida ha roto un plato. 

Hay que ver sin embargo 
Qué malo eres, 
Empeñado en decirme 
Que no me quieres. 

Con ese cuerpo sabio 
Que me impide dormir 
Why esa vida en los labios 
Que quiero para mí 
Con ese gesto ausente why pensativo 
Que pones al mirarme 
Why esas manos que, aunque no te des cuenta 
Han sido hechas para acariciarme. 

Hay que ver sin embargo 
Qué malo eres, 
Empeñado en decirme 
Que no me quieres. 


",Que Malo Eres,1994
Ana Belén,"Dí quién eres tú
Me quemas con tu luz
Como sólo mira el diablo
Me clavó contra la pared
No sé quién puede ser...

Dí quién eres tú
Llegabas desde el sur
Como un gallo alborotado
El deseo sobre la piel
Buscando dónde beber...

Como pesa el calendario sin ti
En la cruz que hay en tu mano lo ví
Esta tumba que es mi cama
Aún conserva restos de ti
Llueve maldito abril!

Era todo tan perfecto
Junto a él descendí al infierno
Why al cielo también subí.

Como pesa el calendario sin ti
En la cruz que hay en tu mano lo ví
Esta tumba que es mi cama
Aún conserva restos de ti
Llueve maldito abril!
Es primavera una vez más maldito abril!


",Quien Eres Tu (Why Can't You Be Have),1994
Ana Belén,"Quiero estar a solas 
Hablarle al espejo 
Desnudarme entera 
Que me llueva adentro. 
Que nadie pregunte 
Que hay en estos ojos 
Sólo son cenizas 
De algún sueño roto. 

Sé que mi camino estaba escrito 
Sé que no conduce al Paraíso. 

Quiero estar a solas 
Tras de los cristales 
Ver como la vida 
Se la lleva el aire. 
Entre los naranjos 
Why los jazmineros 
Para quien me quiera 
Plantaré mi huerto. 

Sé que mi camino estaba escrito 
Sé que no conduce al Paraíso. 

Mira que tristeza lleva el río 
Yo le sigo por la orilla 
Why él me lleva a ver el mar. 
Mira qué tristeza, ay amor mío! 
Cuando pienso en esos labios 
Que no volveré a besar. 

Quiero estar a solas, 
Sola en el desierto 
Que no extrañe a nadie 
Ni me siga el eco. 
Que se vengan todos 
Los que estén dispuestos 
A pintar su sueño 
Con azul del cielo. 

Sé que mi camino estaba escrito 
Sé que no conduce al Paraíso. 

Mira que tristeza lleva el río... 


",Quiero Estar a Solas,1994
Ana Belén,"Vivir sin él es no vivir 
Atarlo en corto es ayudarlo a huir 
Caprichoso como el azar 
Más frágil que la amistad. 

Veneno para el corazón 
No tiene patria, ley ni religión 
Te besa why se va 
Dejándote desnuda frente al mar. 

Te pone a cien, te trata mal, 
Te da placer, te hare alucinar 
Cuando mira, cuando abraza, cuando toca 
Es un rufián, es un pendón 
Es un don Juan, es como un ciclón 
Que te abraza cuando pasa por tu boca. 

Puede ser un traidor 
Puede ser exquisito why formal 
Puede ser una obsesión, una enfermedad. 

Es capaz de hacer reír why de hacer llorar 
Capaz de herir why hasta de matar 
Como un ángel, como un loco, 
Como un príncipe, como un impostor, 
Como un sabio, como un bobo, 
Como un Dios que se llama amor. 

Puede ser un traidor 
Puede ser exquisito why formal 
Puede ser una obsesión, una enfermedad. 

Dice cosas que nadie puede resistir 
Es tan perverso why tan infantil 
Como un niño, como un viejo, 
Como lucifer, tan embriagador 
Como el vino, como el sueño 
Como un Dios que se llama amor.

Um lobo correndo em cí­rculo
Pra alimentar a matilha

Com a fuga de uma ilha

Tanto engorda quanto mata
Feito desgosto de filha
O amor é como um raio
Galopando em desafio
Abre fendas, cobre vales

Revolta as águas dos rios
Quem tentar seguir seu rastro
Se perderá no caminho
Na pureza de um limão
Ou na solidão do espinho

O amor e a agonia
Cerraram fogo no espaço
Brigando horas a fio

Recogieron las basuras
De mi calle, ayer a oscuras
Y hoy sembrada de bombillas.

Y colgaron de un cordel
De esquina a esquina un cartel
Y banderas de papel
Verdes, rojas y amarillas.

Y al darles el sol la espalda
Revolotean las faldas
Bajo un manto de guirnaldas
Para que el cielo no vea,

En la noche de San Juan,
Cómo comparten su pan,
Su tortilla y su gabán,
Gentes de cien mil raleas.

Apurad
Que allí os espero si queréis venir
Pues cae la noche y ya se van
Nuestras miserias a dormir.

Vamos subiendo la cuesta
Que arriba mi calle
Se vistió de fiesta.

Hoy el noble y el villano,
El prohombre y el gusano
Bailan y se dan la mano
Sin importarles la facha.

Juntos los encuentra el sol
A la sombra de un farol
Empapados en alcohol
Abrazando a una muchacha.

Y con la resaca a cuestas
Vuelve el pobre a su pobreza,
Vuelve el rico a su riqueza
Y el señor cura a sus misas.

Se despertó el bien y el mal
La pobre vuelve al portal,
La rica vuelve al rosal,
Y el avaro a las divisas.

Por una noche se olvidó
Que cada uno es cada cual.

Para seguirte amando todo el día.

Pero callé tu boca con mis besos

Cuando cayó la noche, apareció la luna
Why entró por la ventana
Qué cosa más bonita cuando la luz del cielo
Iluminó tu cara...

Desafiando el oleaje
Sin timón ni timonel
Por mis sueños va ligero de equipaje
Sobre un cascarón de nuez
Mi corazón de viaje,
Luciendo los tatuajes
De un pasado bucanero
De un velero al abordaje,
De un no te quiero querer.

why cómo huir
Cuando no quedan islas para naufragar
Al país donde los sabios
Se retiran del agravio
De buscar labios
Que sacan de quicio.
Mentiras que ganan juicios tan sumarios
Que envilecen el cristal de los acuarios
De los peces de ciudad,
Que perdieron las agallas
En un banco de morralla.
En una playa sin mar.",Peces de Ciudad,2001
Ana Belén,"Qué pena
Que esta noche no haya luna llena
Para que me coman toda entera
Los lobos que vienen detrás
Y alivien mi soledad

Qué pena
Que no pase nunca lo que esperas
Que la sangre corra por mis venas
Y no se desborde jamás
Se rinde antes de pelear

Qué pena, el deseo me quema
Qué pena, y el cerebro me frena
Qué pena que esta noche amanezca
Y que yo no te pueda encontrar

Qué pena, si la piel me condena
Qué pena, lo demás me encadena
Qué pena, cuántos labios esperan
Que otras bocas los quieran besar

Qué pena
Que nunca nos soltemos de la rienda
Que no se despierte aquella fiera
Que duerme en el fondo de ti
Y no se atreve a saltar

Por eso digo yo qué pena
No perder a veces la cabeza
No ponerse el mundo por montera
Y dejar de pensar
Y al final jugar sólo por jugar

",Que Pena,2001
Ana Belén,"Sé que existo si me nombras tú
Sé que alumbro si me das tu luz
Que si esperas llegaré puntual
Si no llegas yo te espero igual

Que por tu piel me pongo a caminar
En cada despertar
Que si pides doy, si me llamas voy
Trenzas mi voluntad

Sé que puedo si me lo juras tú
Sin tu cara siempre me sale cruz

Si me sonríes vuelo, si te arrodillas creo
Si tú tropiezas yo caeré
Si me perdonas nazco, si creces yo te alcanzo
Y si me olvidas moriré

Sé que existo si me nombras tú
Que si lloras cargo con tu cruz
Si me rindo es que no oí tu voz
Si te duele me desangro yo

Que por tu piel comienzo a caminar
En cada despertar
Que si pides doy, si me llamas voy
Trenzas mi voluntad

Sé que existo si me nombras tú
Que sin ti seré nadie en la multitud
Que sin ti seré nadie en la multitud

Si me sonríes vuelo, si te arrodillas creo
Si tú tropiezas yo caeré
Si me perdonas nazco, si creces yo te alcanzo
Y si me olvidas moriré

Ana Belén,"Non so aspettarti più di tanto 
Ogni minuto mi dà 
L'istinto di cucire il tempo 
E di portarti di qua 
Ho un materasso di parole 
Scritte apposta per te 
E ti direi spegni la luce 
Che il cielo c'è 
Star lontano da lei non si vive 
Stare senza di lei mi uccide 

Testa dura testa di rapa 
Vorrei amarti anche qua 
Nel cesso di una discoteca 
O sopra il tavolo di un bar 
O stare nudi in mezzo a un campo 
A sentirsi addosso il vento 
Io non chiedo più di tanto 
Anche se muoio son contento 

Star lontano da lei non si vive 
Stare senza di lei mi uccide 

Canzone cercala se puoi 
Dille che non mi perda mai 
Va' per le strade e tra la gente 
Diglielo veramente 

Io I miei occhi dai tuoi occhi 
Non li staccherei mai 
E adesso anzi me li mangio 
Tanto tu non lo sai 
Occhi di mare senza scogli 
Il mare sbatte su di me 
Che ho sempre fatto solo sbagli 
Ma uno sbaglio che cos'è 

Stare lontano da lei non si vive 
Stare senza di lei mi uccide 

Canzone cercala se puoi 
Dille che non mi lasci mai 
Va' per le strade e tra la gente 
Diglielo dolcemente 

E come lacrime la pioggia 
Mi ricorda la sua faccia 
Io la vedo in ogni goccia 
Che mi cade sulla giacca 

Stare lontano da lei non si vive 
Stare senza di lei mi uccide 

Canzone trovala se puoi 
Dille che l'amo e se lo vuoi 
Va' per le strade e tra la gente 
Diglielo veramente 
Non può restare indifferente 
E se rimane indifferente 
Non è lei 

Star lontano da lei non si vive 
Stare senza di lei mi uccide 
Star lontano da lei non si vive 
Stare senza di lei mi uccide",Canción (Canzone),2003
Ana Belén,"Es como una maldición este tiempo sin tu amor, como te extraño
Y como sangra la herida y se me acaba la vida, ya no lo aguanto
Como agua de cristal, así es el amor que yo llevo por dentro
Y me consumo cuando te sueño, las mañanas junto a ti son como el cielo inmenso

Este amor es como mar, algo que se va a escapar, no cabe en mi pecho
Para mantenerme vivo necesito ese motivo que en ti yo encuentro
Cuando ya no pueda mas, voy a salir a volar, voy a buscarte
Y cuando tenga tu amor sincero volverá la luz de nuevo a mi universo

Tu amor es como un río que baña el cuerpo
Es como un remolino que va creciendo
Tu amor es el perfume que trajo el viento
Si te vas a marchar, llévate antes mi cuerpo

Ay, amor que nos abres las puertas. 
Ay, amor tan necesario como el sol. 
Cuando llamas estoy, 
A la hora que tú digas voy. 

Tantas veces nos quitas la pena 
Como tantas es amargo tu sabor. 
Ay, amor del jardín yerba buena 
Como espina puede ser el desamor. 
Cuando llamas estoy, 
A la hora que tú digas voy. 

Ay, amor que derriba fronteras 
Ay, amor que despierta las piedras. 
Si fuera posible amarrar 
Tenerte siempre cerca, poderte controlar. 
Saber cada paso que das 
Si sales o si entras, si vienes o si vas 
Las narices enseñar. 

Ay, amor como inmenso es el mar. 
Es amor quien altera las venas 
Como inventa las mareas o la flor. 
Ay, amor que nos tienes en vela 
Why a quien duerme se le para hasta el reloj. 
Cuando llamas estoy, 
A la hora que tú digas voy. 

Ay, amor como polvo de estrellas 
Ay, amor que derribas fronteras. 
Si fuera posible amarrar 
Tenerte siempre cerca, poderte controlar.

Él siempre espiando tras de una cortina. 
Baila, baila, baila 
Baila, baila, baila bailarina. 

La vió crecer convertirse en mujer 
Desde pequeña estudiando ballet 
Siempre soñando con ser lo que es 
Número uno, mientras que él 
El tramollista siguiendo sus pies 
En la penumbra sin dejarse ver 
Por bambalinas asomándose 
Nunca pudieron sospechar de él. 

Los que presientan que está en la vejez 
Why a los cuarenta, ya no es tiempo de 
Lo que incomoda son sus dieciseis 
Esa barrera que existe why no vé. 
No hay un mal gesto que le haga creer 
Que lo que siente no puede entender 
En sus palabras no existe doblez 
Pero hay miradas que nunca interpreta bien. 

Baila, baila, baila bailarina 
Él siempre espiando tras de una cortina 
Ese amor secreto que pretende ... 

Baila, baila, baila bailarina 
Él siempre espiando tras de una cortina... 

Pero ocurrió lo que puede pasar 
Que la ilusión como viene se va 
En una moto la viene buscar 
Les ve marchar desesperado 
Entre un ruido infernal. 
Desesperado, se quizo colgar 
Se ató una cuerda why saltó del telar 
Ella bailaba, debió aterrizar 
Why fue a llevarle bombones al hospital. 

Baila, baila, baila bailarina 
Él siempre espiando tras de una cortina ...

De la tarde amarilla 
Tres hombres no volvieron 
Hay sirenas, lamentos 
Acompasados ayes 
A la boca del pozo 
Dos mujeres de luto 
Anhelando dos cuerpos 
Y una madre que rumia 
Su agonía en silencio
Es el tercero

A las diez de la luna clara 
Se refleja en las sortijas 
Del patrón recién llegado 
Con sombrero, gravedad 
Y su aburrido gesto
El ha sido el primero 
Vendrán gobernadores 
Alcaldes, ingenieros
Tratarán de calmar 
La presentida viuda 
Que se muerde el pañuelo 
No sabrán acercarse a la madre 
Que les mira con los ojos resecos

A las dos el patrón mirará su reloj 
Los otros ya se fueron 
Y en un punto y aparte 
Esbozará un fastidio 
Mientras piensa 
""Pero dónde están estos?"" 
Ha llegado tu relevo de bomberos 
Y a la una menos diez de la noche 
El primer muerto 
Sentados en el suelo 
Los mineros se hacen cruces 
Y reniegan de Dios 
Quién diría les pillara 
De sorpresa la tragedia repetida 

A veces el más bravo 
Se le queda mirando fijamente al patrón 
Con dientes apretados 
Y el patrón con sombrero 
Tiene dos policías a su lado 
No hay cuidado
Tres horas lentas pasan 
Y a la luz de las linternas asustadas 
El cura con los ojos arrasados 
Al segundo le va uniendo
Sobre el pecho, las manos 
Y un chaval de quince años 
Mientras llora impotente 
Se abraza contra un árbol 
Y el chófer del patrón, con su gorra de plato 
Se siente desplazado 
Es un hombre prudente, bien domado

El rocío ha calado hasta los huesos 
Cuando sale el tercero 
Que recibe con sonrisa gris azul 
La madrugada y con voces los mineros 
Mientras se abrazan todos 
Y uno de ellos, el más fiero 
Por no irse al patrón

Sé con quien no debo andar 
También sé guardar fidelidad 
Sé quiénes son amigos de verdad

",Soy un Corazon Tendido al Sol,2004
Ana Belén,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Dieron Las Diez,2005

Van a dejar los trenes de correr

Van a dejar las aves de emigrar
Van a empeñar los héroes su valor
Van a tomar a tomar los locos el control

Si va a detenerse el mundo
Que no tiene sentido
Levantarse y dar tumbos
Pendientes de tus hilos

Que me importa a la vida
Si tú no estás conmigo

Van a perder los cuerdos la razón
Van a dejar las piezas de encajar
Van a negar los dioses el perdón

Me sube hasta el cielo

Donde se jura algo tan efímero

Ni de tu risa 
Ni de tu prisa 
Por darme un beso 
Ni qué botón 
De tu camisa 
Desabrochaba primero
Ni qué rumba me bailabas

Son como hermanos gemelos 
Que vas echando de más 
Lo que un día echaste de menos

Collides del seu hort.

La nana de la luna llena
Tocaremos para ti
Y en tu cama el sueño bailará
Flotará entre confidencias
Entre anónimas descargas
Ven a radio madrugada
Te sentirás mejor

No estás sola
Alguien te ama en la ciudad
No tengas miedo
Que la alborada llegará
No estás sola
Te queremos confortar
Sal al aire
Cuéntanos de lo que vas
La noche es así niña
No olvides sonreír
Que mañana
Empiezas a vivir",No Estás Sola,2011
Ana Belén,"Nos encontramos una tarde
Bajo el sol de primavera
Te caminando entre mis pasos
Yo vistiéndome en tus huellas
Y nos amamos cara a cara
Y nos besamos en la calle
Y tanto amor se fue fundiendo
Que ahora no puedo olvidarte
Mil razones para amarte
Te eres mi razón primera
Mil poemas en la calle y yo
Yo rodando donde quiera
Y as tu amor me fue naciendo
Como un ro de agua errante
Tu buque atraca en un viejo puerto
Siembro anclas en tu talle
Ya nos amamos cara a cara
Ya nos besamos en la calle
Ahora pregunto si a esta altura
Vida, puedes olvidarme
Mil razones para amarte
Te eres mi razón primera
Mil poemas en la calle y yo
Yo rodando donde quiera
Oye!

Y llenar las tardes de cario
Me sobran mil razones
Para que atraques en mi puerto y ancles conmigo
Me sobran mil razones
Oye! que nuestro amor se va fundiendo, ya no te
Olvido
Me sobran mil razones
Y besarnos en la madrugada
Me sobran mil razones
Para amarte de amapola y trigo
Ey, ey, o lo lo lo, le le leí
Para amarte con tu piel de abrigo
Me sobran mil razones
T caminando entre mis pasos, ya no te olvido
Me sobran mil razones
Y yo rodando por tu cuerpo como roco
Me sobran mil razones
Me basta la aurora desnuda
Me sobran mil razones
Para amarte de amapola y trigo
Ey, ey, o lo lo lo, le le leí
Y llenarlo con tu espacio todo
Me sobran mil razones
Cuando me das de cara a cara sobra cario
Me sobran mil razones
Y un beso me cierra la boca
Me sobran mil razones
Nos encontramos una tarde, noche que anso
Me sobran mil razones
Tengo una casita de cayenas y colores para estar

Ana Belén,"De sobra sabes
Que eres mi bandera
Que no miento si juro que daría
Por ti la vida entera, por ti la vida entera
Y sin embargo un rato cada día
Ya ves
Te engañaría con cualquiera
Te cambiaría por cualquiera

Mitad arrepentid y encantada
De haberme conocido, lo confieso
Oveja descarriada
De tantas madrugadas

Sabes mejor que yo
Que hasta los huesos
Sólo calan los besos
Que no han dado
Los labios del pecado

Porque una casa sin ti es una embajada
El pasillo de un tren de madrugada
Un laberinto sin luz, ni vino tinto
Un velo de alquitrán en la mirada

Y me envenenan los besos que voy dando
Y sin embargo cuando duermo sin ti
Contigo sueño
Y con todos si duermes a mi lado
Y si te vas me voy por los tejados
Como gata sin dueño
Perdida en el pañuelo de amargura
Que empaña sin mancharla tu hermosura

No debería contarlo y sin embargo
Cuando pido la llave de un hotel
Y a medianoche encargo
Un buen champán francés
Y cena con velitas para dos
Siempre es con otro amor nunca contigo
Bien sabes lo que digo

Porque una casa sin ti es una oficina
Un teléfono ardiendo en la cabina
Una palmera en el museo de cera
Un exódo de oscuras golondrinas

Y me envenenan los besos que voy dando
Y sin embargo cuando duermo sin ti
Contigo sueño
Y con todos si duermes a mi lado
Y si te vas, me voy por los tejados
Como gata sin dueño
Perdida en el pañuelo de amargura
Que empaña sin mancharla tu hermosura
Y cuando vuelves hay fiesta en la cocina
Y baile sin orquesta
Y ramos de rosas, con espinas
Pero dos no es igual que uno más uno
Y el lunes, al café del desayuno, vuelve la guerra fría
Y al cielo de tu boca el purgatorio
Y al dormitorio el pan de cada día
Y me envenenan los besos que voy dando",Y Sin Embargo . . .,2011
Ana Belén,"A menudo los hijos se nos parecen
Así nos dan la primera satisfacción
Esos que se menean con nuestros gestos
Echando mano a cuanto hay a su alrededor
Esos locos bajitos que se incorporan 
Con los ojos abiertos de par en par
Sin respeto al horario ni a las costumbres 
Y a los que, por su bien, hay que domesticar

Niño, deja ya de joder con la pelota
Niño, que eso no se dice
Que eso no se hace
Que eso no se toca

Cargan con nuestros dioses y nuestro idioma
Nuestros rencores y nuestro porvenir
Por eso nos parece que son de goma 
Y que les bastan nuestros cuentos para dormir

Nos empeñamos en dirigir sus vidas 
Sin saber el oficio y sin vocación
Les vamos trasmitiendo nuestras frustraciones 
Con la leche templada y en cada canción

Niño, deja ya de joder con la pelota

Que las agujas avancen en el reloj
Que decidan por ellos, que se equivoquen
Que crezcan y que un día nos digan adiós",Esos Locos Bajitos,2016

I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call

When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

When you're gone and I'm all by myself
And I need your caress
I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just close my eyes
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes I love you so
And that for me is all I need to know

Til the sun falls from out of the sky
For what else can I do
I will wait for you meditating

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

Si estoy debajo del vaivén de tus piernas
Si estoy hundido en un vaivén de caderas

Te vas a otro cielo
Y regresas como los colibríes

Vuelve a mí tu boca y provoca

Amor mutante
Amigos con derecho y sin derecho

Y siempre tengo que esperar paciente
El pedazo que me toca de ti

Eh! Mi boca en llamas torturada
Te desnudas angelada y luego te vas

Se juntos já jogamos tudo fora
Me conta agora como hei de partir
Se, ao te conhecer, dei pra sonhar, fiz tantos desvarios
Rompi com o mundo, queimei meus navios
Me diz pra onde é que inda posso ir
Se nós, nas travessuras das noites eternas
Já confundimos tanto as nossas pernas
Diz com que pernas eu devo seguir
Se entornaste a nossa sorte pelo chão
Se na bagunça do teu coração
Meu sangue errou de veia e se perdeu
Como, se na desordem do armário embutido
Meu paletó enlaça o teu vestido
E o meu sapato inda pisa no teu
Como, se nos amamos feito dois pagãos
Teus seios inda estão nas minhas mãos
Me explica com que cara eu vou sair
Não, acho que estás te fazendo de tonta
Te dei meus olhos pra tomares conta
Agora conta como hei de partir

Nem falei que podia me esquecer
Vou sorrir pra tristeza agora
Vou viver os meus dias sem você",Só Fala Em Mimi,2003
Ana Carolina,"Acabou
Agora tá tudo acabado
Seu vestido estampado
Dei a quem pudesse servir
Agora que eu não posso mais caber em ti
Não quero te ver, dizem que você não quer mais me olhar
Como velhos desconhecidos se você não me escuta eu não vou te chamar
O amor que eu dei não foi o mesmo que eu vi acabar
O amor só mudou de cor, agora já tá desbotado
Corra lá vem à tristeza atirando pra todos os lados
Pegue o vestido estampado, guarde pro carnaval
Guarde que eu nunca te quis mal
Até o feriado quarta feira de cinzas e tá tudo acabado

Ana Carolina,"Olho a cidade ao redor
E nada me interessa
Eu finjo ter calma
A solidão me apressa

Tantos caminhos sem fim
De onde você não vem
Meu coração na curva
Batendo a mais de cem

Eu vou sair nessas horas de confusão
Gritando seu nome entre os carros que vêm e vão
Quem sabe, então assim
Você repara em mim 

Corro de te esperar
De nunca te esquecer
As estrelas me encontram
Antes de anoitecer

Olho a cidade ao redor
Eu nunca volto atrás
Já não escondo a pressa
Já me escondi demais

Eu vou contar pra todo mundo
Eu vou pichar sua rua
Vou bater na sua porta de noite
Completamente nua
Quem sabe, então assim
Você repara em mim",Nua,2004
Ana Carolina,"Quando eu te vi andava tão desprevenido
Que nem ouvi tocar o alarme de perigo
E você foi me conquistando devagar
Quando notei já não tinha como recuar

E foi assim que nos juntamos distraídos
Que no começo tudo é muito divertido
Mas sempre tinha um amigo pra falar
Que o nosso amor nunca foi feito pra durar

Por mais que eu durma eu não descanso
Por mais que eu corra eu não te alcanço
Mas não tem jeito eu não sei como esperar
Desesperar também não vou
Não vou deixar você passar
Como água escorrendo nos dedos
Fluindo pra outro lugar

Ninguém pode negar que o nosso amor é tudo
Tudo que pode acontecer com dois bicudos
Não são tão poucas as arestas pra aparar
Mas é que o meu desejo não deseja se calar

Até os erros já parecem ter sentido
Não sei se eu traí primeiro ou fui traído
Não te pedi uma conduta exemplar
Mas é que a sua ausência é o que me dói no calcanhar


Por mais que eu durma eu não descanso
Por mais que eu corra eu não te alcanço
Mas não tem jeito eu não sei como esperar
Desesperar também não vou
Não vou deixar você passar
Como água escorrendo nos dedos
Fluindo pra outro lugar
Será sempre será 
O nosso amor não morrerá
Depois que eu perdi o meu medo
Não vou mais te deixar",2 Bicudos,2005
Ana Carolina,"É mágoa
Já vou dizendo de antemão
Se eu encontrar com você
Tô com três pedras na mão
Eu só queria distância da nossa distância
Saí por aí procurando uma contramão
Acabei chegando na sua rua
Na dúvida qual era a sua janela
Lembrei que era pra cada um ficar na sua
Mas é que até a minha solidão tava na dela
Atirei uma pedra na sua janela
E logo correndo me arrependi
Foi o medo de te acertar
Mas era pra te acertar
E disso eu quase me esqueci
Atirei outra pedra na sua janela
Uma que não fez o menor ruído
Não quebrou, não rachou, não deu em nada
E eu pensei: talvez você tenha me esquecido
Eu só não consegui foi te acertar o coração
Porque eu já era o alvo de tanto que eu tinha sofrido
Aí nem precisava mais de pedra
Minha raiva quase transpassa a espessura do seu vidro
É mágoa
O que eu choro é água com sal
Se der um vento é maremoto
Se eu for embora não sou mais eu
Água de torneira não volta
E eu vou embora
Adeus",E Magoa,2005
Ana Carolina,"Hoje eu tô sozinha
E não aceito conselho
Vou pintar minhas unhas e meu cabelo de vermelho
Hoje eu tô sozinha
Não sei se me levo ou se me acompanho
Mas é que se eu perder, eu perco sozinha
Mas é que se eu ganhar
Aí é só eu que ganho

Hoje eu não vou falar mal nem bem de ninguém
Hoje eu não vou falar bem nem mal de ninguém

Logo agora que eu parei
Parei de te esperar
De enfeitar nosso barraco
De pendurar meus enfeites
De fazer o café fraco
Parei de pegar o carro correndo
De ligar só pra você
De entender sua família e te compreender
Hoje eu tô sozinha e tudo parece maior
Mas é melhor ficar sozinha que é pra não ficar pior",Hoje Eu to Sozinha,2005

Invento moda, caio dentro,

Vou fazendo meu batuque,
Me chamam de batuqueiro.

Não passo de maloqueiro,
Se eu tô sempre numa esquina,
Viro logo macumbeiro,
Quando eu mando uma levada,
Levo fama de funkeiro,

Se você caminha pra nunca chegar 
Então vou no fundo, ameaço ir embora

Eu queria tanto mudar sua vida 
Mas você não sabe se vai ou se fica 
Eu tenho coragem, já estou de saída 
Você diz que é pouco 
E pouco pra mim não é bobagem 
E subo bem alto pra gritar que é amor 
Eu vou de escada pra elevar a dor

Eu vou de escada pra elevar a dor  

Então me lanço, me atiro, em frente ao seu carro

É mesmo exagero ou vaidade

Aos poucos fui ficando mesmo sem saída

Acompanhadas de um bilhete me deixam nervosa
Toda mulher gosta de rosas e rosas e rosas
Muitas vezes são vermelhas mas sempre são rosas

Ana Carolina,"Nas ruas de outono
Os meus passos vão ficar
E todo abandono que eu sentia vai passar
As folhas pelo chão
Que um dia o vento vai levar
Meus olhos só verão que tudo poderá mudar

Eu voltei por entre as flores da estrada
Pra dizer que sem você não há mais nada
Quero ter você bem mais que perto
Com você eu sinto o céu aberto

Daria pra escrever um livro
Se eu fosse contar
Tudo que passei antes de te encontrar
Pego sua mão e peço pra me escutar
Seu olhar me diz que você 
Quer me acompanhar",Ruas de Outono,2007

Nem vem com essa história
Eu nem quero ouvir
Não dá pra te esquecer agora
Como assim?
'Cê disse que me amava tanto ontem

Calma aí!
Que diabo você tá dizendo agora?
Que onda é essa de outro lance pra viver?
Você nem pode tá falando sério
Vivi pra você, morri pra você
Pois então vai
A porta esteve aberta o tempo todo, sai
Quem tá lhe segurando? Você sabe voar
Vai, a porta na verdade nem existe sai
O está esperando? Você sabe voar
Então tá bom

Senta e conta logo tudo devagar
Não minta, não me faça suportar
Você caindo nesse abismo enorme
Tão fora de mim, tá legal
É, e eu faço o quê com a nossa vida genial?
'Cê vai viver pra outra vida
E eu fico aqui
Na vida que ficou em minha vida
Tão perto de mim
Tão longe de mim

Ana Carolina,"Eu já não sei respirar quando estou ao lado seu.
Juro que me falta o ar, a paixão bateu.
Você é aquela mulher escondida nas letras de tantas
Canções
Deste lado do rio eu posso ver tudo o que é seu
Delicadeza e mistério que nem você percebeu.

Quero chamar sua atenção 
Com as pausas do meu violão
Resta 
Nada resta
Leio o seu nome nas águas do amor 
Que correm a deslizar

Passa 
Tudo passa
Se eu não consigo dizer 
Eu só posso escrever 
Cartas com o olhar
Com o olhar

Se io non posso parlare ora che sei con me
È forse un modo di osare dimmi tu che cos'è
Tu che raccogli il mio cuore senza far rumore

Da questo lato del fiume ogni cosa è più facile
Le mani scorrono libere su di te
Tu che respiri le pause della mia canzone

Resta, resta, resta
Ora che scrivo il tuo nome sull'acqua del fiume
Passa tutto passa

Ma
Tu non sei una primavera 
Tu non sei una sera
Se apro gli occhi e ti trovo ancora?
Ti trovo ancora?

Sei que você tem lá suas razões
Olho milhões de vezes sua foto
Me pergunto em que ponto perdemos o foco
Por que você não atende se vê que sou eu?
Será que é teu jeito de dizer adeus?

Daqui a 10 minutos talvez eu enlouqueça
Enlouqueça

E depois não quis mais

Procurei seu passo incerto
Pra me aproximar a tempo

O seu código de guerra
E a certeza que te cerca
Me fazem ficar atento

Não me importa a sua crença
Eu quero a diferença
Que me faz te olhar de frente

Pra falar de tolerância
E acabar com essa distância
Entre nós dois

Deixa eu te levar
Não há razão e nem motivo
Pra explicar
Que eu te completo
E que você vai me bastar
Tô bem certo de que você vai gostar
Você vai gostar

Deixa eu te levar
Não há razão e nem motivo
Pra explicar
Que eu te completo
E que você vai me bastar
Tô bem certo de que você vai gostar
Você vai gostar, eh

Como lava no oceano
Um esforço sobre humano
Pra recomeçar do zero

Se pareço ainda estranho
Se não sou do seu rebanho
E ainda assim, te quero

É que o amor é soberano
E supera todo engano
Sem jamais perder o elo

E é por isso que te espero
E já sinto a mesma coisa em seu olhar

Deixa eu te levar

Motivo pra explicar

Let it go, let it go

Let the storm rage on

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014

Yo solo quiero amarte mas 
Tu solo quieres lastimar 
Ya no me busques, no me interesa 
Tu amor con desamor 
 
Yo solo quiero ser tu andar 
Tu marinero de alta mar 
Ya no me mires, ya no me inquietes 
No, oh, oh, no 
 
Yo solo quiero",Amor con Desamor,1992

En tus detalles grandes y pequeños amor 
Me acostumbrabas cada día más

Ana Gabriel,"No puedo dormir
Siento que mi llanto va a escaparse
Pues me he dado cuento que yo
No soy del tipo que a ti te convence

Tú, quisiste estar allá
Dijiste que quizá, ese era tu destino
Después que todo te fallo, hoy quieres regresar
Why ser feliz conmigo

Pero tu, no piensas que mi amor
Por siempre te olvido, why exiges mi cariño
De veras lo siento no podré
Volverme a enamorar, de ti ya no es lo mismo

Solo espero que entiendas que un amor
Se debe de cuidar why no jugar con nadie
Porque yo te daba mi querer why aun sin merecer
No te dolió dejarme

Ahora vuelves, buscando mi calor
Diciendo que jamas lograste olvidarme
Pero yo te aclaro de una vez
Lo debes de entender, es demasiado tarde

Yo no te guardo rencor
Pero tampoco amor, de ti ya nada queda
No niego fue mucho mi dolor
Pero eso ya paso, mejor ya nunca vuelvas

Solo espero que entiendas que un amor
Se debe de cuidar why no jugar con nadie
Porque yo te daba mi querer why aun sin merecer
No te dolió dejarme

Ahora vuelves, buscando mi calor
Diciendo que jamas lograste olvidarme
Pero yo te aclaro de una vez
Lo debes de entender, es demasiado tarde

Porque tu, quisiste estar allá

Pensé que te estorbaba quise echar a correr
Te olvidaste por segundos
Que yo estaba junto a ti
Y al sentir que te observaba tu quisiste fingir",Es Diferente,1993
Ana Gabriel,"Cuando te miro no me puedo controlar
Siento las ansias de acercarme mas
Me falta el aire y mi inquietud que va creciendo
Después de verte no responde ya mi corazón

Yo solo espero que comprendas este amor
En cualquier parte yo te quiero ver
Y aunque no sabes la misma espera me lastima
Por no poder a ti abrazarme y darte mi pasión

Estas emociones son por ti
Solo por tenerte aquí y hablar
No se cuanto tiempo mas podre
Este sentimiento a ti callar

Yo tengo frio me falta tu calor
Paso las noches esperando algo mejor
Se pasa el tiempo y yo te encuentro tan lejano
Después de todo tu no sabes de este gran amor

Cuando despierto se desborda mi pasión
Estoy a punto de arrancarme el corazón
Ya mas no puedo no tengo fuerzas de callarlo
Si no te digo lo que siento voy a enloquecer

Estas emociones son por ti
Solo por tenerte aquí y hablar
No se cuanto tiempo mas podre
Este sentimiento a ti callar

Estas emociones son por ti
Solo por tenerte",Estas Emociones (Ode E Adao),1993
Ana Gabriel,"Casi no te veo ya 
Y todo gira en torno a ti 
Dime como hacerle para no pensar en ti 

Tus ausencias no podré 
Aguantarlas yo le sé 
Es mejor hablarnos y aclararlo todo bien 

Mírame a los ojos 
Dime si es verdad lo que pienso 
Que un nuevo amor logró arrancarme de tu ser y ahora quieres irte ya 

Vamos que te cuesta 
Háblame de todo y de frente 
Que tus palabras me devuelvan realidad 
Creo es mejor para los dos 

Nada te reclamo solo quiero la verdad 

Ya lo nuestro no es igual 
No me puedes engañar 
Pero tu silencio cada vez me hiere más 

Yo no puedo estar así

Esta noche sé que él está
Contemplándote igual que yo

A través de ti quiero darle un beso

Aconséjale por favor
De que vuelva convéncelo te ruego

Luna, tu que lo ves, dile cuanto es que sufro
Luna y dile que vuelva porque ya es mucho

Tu que sabes en donde está
Acaríciale con mi amor
Dile que él es a quien yo mas, mas quiero

Su sendero porque quizás
No es bueno, no es bueno
Quizás no es bueno

Fácil era para mí la vida

Te puedo ya contar de aquel amor
Tan grande que sentí
Fue inmenso y nunca me atreví
A confesarte nada y tuve que partir

Por cierto yo quise retenerte
Saber lo que pasaba
Pues, algo imaginaba de ese amor
Te fuiste sin comentarme nada
Y en mi sólo quedaba la duda y fue mi error

Quisiera que entendieras, por favor
Que nunca quise hacerle daño a nadie
Yo amaba y ese fue quizás como aprendí
Que siempre a quien amas no te ama

No debes de quejarte sin razón
Tú nunca confesaste ese cariño
Yo entiendo que nos faltó valor
De hablarnos cara a cara y sin mentirnos

Después de todo terminó
Aquel amor callado
Que tanto nos dañó

Después de todo terminó
Aquel amor callado
Que tanto nos dañó

El tiempo que estuve yo alejada
Calmó todas mis penas
Y al fin pude librar mi corazón
Hoy vuelvo sin miedo y sin rencor
Dejando en el olvido, los días de dolor

Ahora me toca a mí contarte
Decirte que sus besos
No fueron de verdad y como creí
Fue falso y mentiroso nada más
Por fin tu lo olvidaste ya puedes ser feliz

Quisiera que entendieras, por favor
Que nunca quise hacerle daño a nadie
Yo amaba y ese fue quizás como aprendí
Que siempre a quien amas no te ama

No debes de quejarte sin razón
Tú nunca confesaste ese cariño
Yo entiendo que nos faltó valor
De hablarnos cara a cara y sin mentirnos

Después de todo terminó

Que tanto nos dañó

No me duele el haberlos perdido,
Lo que sí me lastima en el alma,
Ver dejado a mí pueblo querido.

A mí novia que tanto adoraba,
A correr yo me fui por el mundo,
Sin saber lo que a mí me esperaba.

Una tarde lluviosa de junio,
A mí casa feliz regresaba,
A mis padres encontré en la tumba,
Y a mí novia la encontré casada.

Comprendí que era falso en la vida,
Con dinero se compra y se paga,
Nunca tuve un cariño sincero,

Pregunte si con el tiempo, 
Sus recuerdos olvidaron

Que un viejo amor, 
Ni se olvida ni se deja 
Que un viejo amor, 
De nuestra alma si se aleja, 
Pero nunca dice adiós 
Que un viejo amor

Que un viejo amor",Un Viejo Amor,1996
Ana Gabriel,"Es tarde ya 
La noche tiende a despertar 
Es tarde ya 
Y tu presencia empiezo a extrañar 

Quiero saber que te detiene allá 
Porque no vuelves junto a mi 
Quizás sea mejor 
Decirlo sin temor, amor 

Dime si estoy cayendo en un error 
Y exijo mas de lo que doy 
Dime si el cielo que te ofrecen es mejor 
Que no te falta mi calor 

Dime si estoy creyendo que te vas 
Que son mis celos nada mas 
Quiero saber si es solo mi temor 
Y así tener tranquilidad 

Es tarde ya, 
Las horas me fulminan sin piedad 
Es tarde ya, 
Y el frío de tu ausencia me estremece mas 

Quiero saber que te detiene allá 
Porque no vuelves junto a mi 
Quizás sea mejor 
Decirlo sin temor, amor 

Dime si estoy cayendo en un error 
Y exijo mas de lo que doy

Que no te falta mi calor 

Quiero saber si es solo mi temor, 
Y así tener tranquilidad",Es Tarde Ya,1996
Ana Gabriel,"Esta noche tengo para ti 
Calor que brota de mi ser 
Quiero regalarte todo lo que llevo en mi 

Esta noche yo te are feliz 
Daré a tu mundo una ilusión 
Me vestiré de luna y aremos una fiesta de amor 

Tengo que mirar al cielo y confesar 
Que muero por tus ojos amor 
Que haré mucho tiempo yo me imagine 
Dejar mi huella por doquier 
Volver tu mundo del revés 

Quiero conocer esos puntos de amor 
Y juntos descubrir las estrellas

Ana Gabriel,"Cuando yo recuerdo 
Que una vez lo abandone 
Yo me pongo a llorar 
Y no se que hacer para olvidar 
Oh! Yo no se que voy a hacer 
Su ausencia me mata 
Y yo no puedo volver 

Cuando yo recuerdo 
Que una vez me engaño 
El dolor me haré ver 
Que al dejarlo yo tuve razón 
Oh! Yo no se que voy a hacer 
Su ausencia me mata

Ana Gabriel,"No es por culpa tuya 
Tu apenas llegaste 
Es por las vivencias 
Y de tanto equivocarme 

No es un buen momento 
Mucho me han golpeado 
Y en cuestión de amor 
La vida ya me ha maltratado 

Para comprenderme 
Te haré falta vida 
Tener mil amores 
Y la mitad de mis heridas
Volar alto alto 
Y caer de golpe 
Solamente así comprenderás 
Porque yo siento 

Tanto miedo 
De volverme a enamorar 
Y otra vez poner
En riesgo el corazón 
Tanto miedo 
De intentar y fracasar 
Miedo de perder una vez mas 

Miedo de que el miedo 
No me deje verte 
De no darme cuenta 
Que el amor lo tuve enfrente 
Y que siempre estuvo 
Viéndome en tus ojos 
Y yo como tonta
Lo deje pasar tan solo 

Tanto miedo 
De volverme a enamorar",Miedo,1996
Ana Gabriel,"Me culpas, de lo que pasa a tu alrededor 
Les mientes cuando dices que fui yo 
Quien te hizo daño

Y creo que vendrás después a mi, a suplicarme 
Yo entiendo que tus miedos son los culpables 
A este amor que es puro y bello 
Y tu lo sabes 

No sabes distinguir lo que es amor 
Pues nunca te han amado de verdad 
Descubro que no tienes corazón 
Por eso lo que di lo despreciaste 
Por eso lo que di lo despreciaste 

Te escondes cuando busco una explicación 
Presiento que alguien mas te aconsejo que me dejaras 
No viste ni siquiera lo que yo siento 
Y mi amor es tan inmenso es otro cuento

Y con ellos los años 
Para mi es igual 
Tu sigues como siempre 
Metido en mi alma 
Como hacen los peces 
En los ríos y el mar

Que las hondas heridas 
Jamas sanaran 
Pues aunque haya querido 
Olvidar el pasado 
Cada día que pasa 
Te recuerdo mas 

Yo no sé 
Porque nunca te puedo olvidar 
Yo no sé 
Porque nunca te arranco de mi 
Si hasta el cielo le pido y no se 
Que haré yo si no te tengo aquí 

Yo quisiera encontrar 
El medio de alcanzar 
Lo que tanto he anhelado 
Pero hay una barrera 
Que a los dos nos separa 
Y que manos extrañas 
Nos la han colocado 

Testigo me es el tiempo 
De el amor que en el alma 
He venido guardando 
Pues se ha hecho tan inmenso

Del mismo dolor 
No puedo soportarlo 

Yo no sé 
Porque nunca te puedo olvidar 
Yo no sé",Que Hare Sin Ti,1996
Ana Gabriel,"Algo me decía que tu, no me querías
Que tu amor no era real, que me fingías
Pero me negaba a creer yo no quería
Aceptar la realidad pues me dolía

Como imaginar que era en tu vida solo fantasía
Como me pudiste engañar si en mi nunca hubo una mentira
Dime que buscabas en mi sino me amabas
Como tanto tiempo pudiste jugar sin miedo con mis sentimientos
Que difícil es saber que tu mentías

Siempre yo trate de encontrar mil formas de amarte
Y yo se que me cegué, pues te creía
Ahora yo me quedo sin ti, que triste vida

Ana Gabriel,"Siempre que te tengo cerca de mi
Acaricio el aire con olor a ti
Siempre que te veo que difícil es
No poder decirte que te llevo en mi

Tengo que callarlo, es mejor así
Aunque este deseando lo tengo que ocultar

Porque tu no te imaginas que muero por tu amor
Que eres el insomnio de mi amanecer
Tu no te imaginas que yo quisiera ser
En cada madrugada un grito de amor

Cuando no me buscas yo quisiera ir
Pero me detengo no puedo seguir
Solo me pregunto que será de mi
Me haces tanta falta para ser feliz

Tengo que callarlo, es mejor así
Aunque este deseando lo tengo que ocultar

Porque tu no te imaginas que muero por tu amor
Que eres el insomnio de mi amanecer
Tu no te imaginas que yo quisiera ser
En cada madrugada un grito de amor

Porque tu no te imaginas

Ana Gabriel,"Oh, the sun beats down
And burns the theater 
And your shoes get so hot 
You wish your tired feet were fireproof

Under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea 
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be 
 
From the park near here 
Happy sounds from the carousel 
You can almost taste the hot dogs and 
French fries they sell

Under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea 
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

Decir adiós si no hay razón 
Si no hay porque 
Sin motivo, sin explicación

Sola, sigo extrañándote a la fuerza 
Sin reconocer tu ausencia 
Mi alma se desprende y vuela tras de ti 
Mi mente y mi conciencia saben que es el fin 
Mi corazón te llama en cada madrugada 

Yo no te dije adiós 
Y me dejaste 
Yo te creía fiel 
Igual que el aire 
No es fácil despertar 
Y no encontrarte 
No es fácil consolarme 
Si tengo que olvidarte 

Yo no te dije adiós, 
Y me dejaste 
Faltaron tantas cosas 
Que entregarte 
Faltaron tantas cosas 
Que enseñarme 
Yo no te dije adiós

Si no hay amor,

Y me complace tener a alguien como tú. 

Y entre tus cuerdas 
Van mis lamentos, mis ilusiones amiga fiel

Desnudo mi alma y te confieso mi pensar. 
Tú siempre dispuesta tú 
A darme fuerzas sin mirar la adversidad.

Mas yo no sé si es mejor callar 
Este sentimiento que llevo dentro 
No quiero herir nuestra amistad, 
Pero la verdad ya no puedo mas 

Cuando te miro de frente, todo mi cuerpo se agita 
Bajo la vista por miedo, mi amigo 
De gritar cuanto me gustas. 
Marco distancia contigo, por mas que quiera buscarte 
No quiero que tu te ofendas mi amigo, 
Si es que no sientes lo mismo

Ni siquiera te imaginaste, que era falso el rumor 
Y te marchaste sin darme tiempo a decir si o no. 

Llegará el momento en que se aclare ésta situación 
Y así sabrás que me di completa y sin condición. 
Yo solo espero que no sufras lo mismo que he sufrido yo 
Cuando comprendas que me perdiste por un error 

Me contaron que no quieres saber más de mi 
Pero te escondes a escuchar las canciones que escribí para ti. 
Estoy segura y muy segura que no puedes huir 
De todo aquello que nos dimos sin freno, diferente al fin.

Que mi cariño ya no te haré falta. 
No es necesario esta vez que tú me pidas perdón

Desde haré tiempo que yo vengo fijándome en ti 
Y desde entonces nada es igual. 
Tú te atreviste a fingir mucho cariño por mi 
Y eso me hirió de más. 

Te descubrí en la forma real 
Vienes aquí y después te vas 
Quiero decirte que puedes seguir 
Con tus traiciones en otro lugar.

Su mirada, apuntando al corazón, si nada es normal

Partida, si guardas en tu sueño un sitio para el,
Si esperas con la noche como empieza amanecer,
Si tu imaginación ya no te deja respirar y prendes fuego,
Fuego, fuego, entonces no hay remedio.

Hay, hay, hay, es el amor quien llega
Hay, hay, hay, despierta que se va, el es el único

Ganador, hay, hay, hay, permite que te atrape
Hay, hay, hay, puede ser un ladrón el, es el único
Pícaro, sinico, si se presenta una batalla sale

Si miras las estrellas, buscando un no se que, si
Sientes que tus ojos se hunde el sin querer, si notas
Que el calor te viene a golpes de tensión y pega fuerte, fuerte,
Fuerte, entonces mucha suerte.

Me equivoque a lo macho
Como muy pocas gentes se habrán equivocado

Te conocí en la iglesia, y te mire en silencio
Por no turbar tu rezo, que para mi es sagrado
Con tu carita buena, con tu mirada clara
Con tantas otras cosas hubiera yo jurado

Pero que triste realidad me has ofrecido
Que decepción tan grande haberte conocido
Quien sabe Dios porque te puso en mi camino

Me equivoque contigo, como si no supiera
Que las mas grandes penas, las debo mis amores
Me equivoque contigo, después de tantos años
De tantas amarguras y tantas decepciones

Pero te hallé en la iglesia
Con tu mirada clara
Me hizo formar de nuevo un mundo de ilusiones

Y aun recuerdo esa rutina, de gozar cada mañana 
En los momentos mas difíciles fuiste tu ese diva

se ha metido despacio y sin miedo muy dentro de mi ser 
tu amor se ha aferrado a mi alma 
me ha quitado hasta el sueño y aunque ha sido 
muy bello, te tendré que dejar 

Después de beberme tu aliento 
que difícil se me haré tener que dejarte y no poder 
me duele muy adentro del pecho 
la tristeza me abraza y de veras me mata 
no volverte a ver 

y a pesar de todos, te amo y a pesar de todos, me amas 
y aunque yo esté lejos, cuidaré de cerca tus pasos 
y a pesar de todos, te amo y a pesar de todos, me amas 
lucharé a distancia para que lo nuestro no muera 

Porque un amor como el nuestro a los ojos del mundo 
no es nada aceptable sólo es un error 
porque no podemos amarnos si los dos nos deseamos 
y tener que dejarnos, nos destroza a los dos. 

Yo sé que tú sufres lo mismo, que te duele dejarme, 
no verme y callarte este gran amor 
dejarnos, no queremos dejarnos 
pero ellos no entienden, porque amores como este 
no se dan a montón.

Que yo estoy aquí 
Suspirando por ti 
Suspirando por ti 

Me voy perdiendo lentamente 
En los sueños de ayer 
Mis labios pidiendo amor 

Dejando huellas de la historia 
Que no pudo ser 
Tan sólo me da su adiós 
Sigo esperando bajo el cielo gris 
Que vuelvas a mi 
Grito de ausencia que quiere morir 

Pido al olvido que se lleve tus 
Recuerdos de aquí 
Claro de luna que llora por ti 

En vano te he esperado 
Que vuelvas a mi lado 
Te busco y no te encuentro 
Perdida en el silencio 
Claro de luna que llora por ti 
Mira al cielo y escucha 
Que yo estoy aquí 
Suspirando por ti 
Suspirando por ti 

Claro de luna 
En vano te he esperado 
Ya no me escuchas 
Te quiero a mi lado

Ya no me escuchas",Claro de Luna,1999

Imaginando bailar suavemente
Sentir que nuestros cuerpos se entallan uno a uno
Amando sin amar, mirándote al pasar

Si hay pasión que se muere
En el silencio del eco dormido
Caricias que me llevan hasta un mundo conocido

Si hay rumor que se pierde, en las paredes del cuarto vacío
Suspiros que te gritan que me ames sin sentido
Hablando sin hablar, pensando en ti nada mas

Creo que me estoy quedando en la obscuridad
Why en vano busco, una señal que me lleve muy cerca de ti
Siento que no soy la misma desde que te vi
Why lejos queda toda esperanza que diga que puedes enamorarte de mi
Creo que me estoy quedando en la obscuridad

No sé qué hacer con el amor 
Que se quedó conmigo 
De tanto amar no supe amor 
Why ahora estoy llorando por ti

Pensé que era más fácil olvidarte

Me estoy poniendo (volviendo) loca 
Con tanto amor que no supe entregarte

Ahora estoy sin ti 
Why el sol se pone triste
Por Dios perdóname 
Que igual que estoy 
Como siempre, amándote

No sé porqué te dije adiós, 
Cariño mío, sin comprenderte
Fue un resbalón del corazón
Que me obligó a quedarme sin ti
Estoy arrepentida de aquella despedida
Pensé que el próximo día podía olvidarte

Estoy aquí muy sola

Mi alma esta sedienta ya perdió su luz

Ay! que sola estoy
Me miro en el espejo y me pregunto quien soy yo
Ha! Ha!
Muere mi esperanza ya no tiene salvación
Y nadie quien despierte mi ilusión
Y  me hable con ternura del amor
Ay! que sola estoy, Ay! muriendo voy

Huelo a soledad
No encuentro  ni un camino que seguir
Me faltan fantasías por vivir
Y el eco de un murmullo en mi sentir
Me pierdo en un instante sin saber

Tengo tanto miedo que no escucho al corazón
Mi alma esta sedienta ya perdió su luz

Ay! que sola estoy,
Me miro en el espejo y me pregunto quien soy yo
Ha! Ha! 
Muere mi esperanza ya no tienen salvación
Y nadie quien despierte mi ilusión y me hable
Con ternura del amor

Ay! que sola estoy

Ay! muriendo voy
Ay! que sola estoy, Ay muriendo voy, Ha!",Huelo a Soledad (A Capella),2001

The sweetness of your love
Left a scar upon my heart
The darkest of all kisses felt so right
My lips can still remember the salt of your sea
If only I had known that you were making light
Ah! the misery

The best is what I had with you
At least that's I thought
I was but a lie you never opened up your heart
Your kisses only hid the truth from me
While I kept falling more and more in love
You knew that in your arms I lost all reason and all rhyme
The passion you aroused in me made dizziness sublime
Heartache lay ahead I couldn't see
You called a name out loud it wasn't me

Now bittersweet the taste of sweet and salt is mine
Ah! You stole my heart so cruelly
All I have to savor is the sweetness and salt
Of the memory of a love that couldn't be

Si no sabes de mi

Pero yo te perdono
Toda tu ingrata ausencia
No importa que a mi vida
La hayas vuelto infeliz

Fui mucho y muy feliz

No puedo decir

Que no, que no vale la pena

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Ana Guerra,"Fueron cuatro los segundos que pasaron
hasta que pude encontrarte entre los rostros congelados
Y pasó una eternidad al mirarte y contemplar
en tus ojos reflejada mi mirada
Y hoy bendigo las razones casuales por las que decidiste
elegir mi banco para esperar, para encontrar
Fue tu rose, fue tu aroma, despertando mis hormonas
lo que me obligó a cerrar la mente y respirar, y controlar la activación

Y mi razón se convirtió en buscarte entre las calles, en los parques, tiendas, bares; en sonrisas y destellos de cristal
Quien siguió la consiguió y esta historia comenzó a brillar
Y buen día te atreviste a confesarme que tenías tanto miedo a que yo supiera de tu realidad, y no comprendes…

Que no es tu signo positivo en que invierte en conflictivo
las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora
tu quien me convierte en la mejor persona
Y si tengo que gritarte lo que siento
Te digo que te quiero con tu suerte, con tu mierda
con pasado, con presente, con o sin enfermedad
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos…
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos…

Y es que el miedo que yo tengo es simplemente
no poder saborearte lo suficiente
Es dejarte escapar, es vivir sin apostar
por quien juega con la mano más potente
Son tus ojos, no tu sangre, los que arrastré a mi cama
cada noche y cada día al despertar
Y es tu sexo, no tu sangre, el que se adentra protegido
entre los huecos más oscuros de mi intimidad, y no comprendes
Que es tu risa, no tu sangre, quien contagia de alegría
las esquinas, los rincones de mi vida
Que eres tú, que no es tu sangre, quien invade de felicidad mis días

Que no es tu signo positivo en que invierte en conflictivo

Los padres los amigos y el amor
Para poder decir lo que hay en mi interior
Los retos las presiones y el temor

Entre tantos mares
Sola por cruzar busco fuerzas
En mi pecho para dar

Por el amor que tú me das cada mañana
Se despierta solo en mi y
Aunque no estás de frente a mí
(Aunque no estás)

Me hace sentir mis ideas
Y la paz que siento en mí
Si pienso en ti
(Si pienso en ti)

Busco caminar yo seguiré tu voz
Susurras a mi oído una canción
Me dices aquí estas sin importar mi error

Me entregas mil caricias con tu amor
Entre tanta gente quiero navegar
Con mi propia huella sé que he de llegar

Por el amor que tú me das cada mañana
Se despierta solo en mi y
Aunque no estás de frente a mí

Será,  será como tu quieras pero así será
Si aun tengo que esperarte siete vidas mas
Me quedare colgado de este sentimiento

Por amarte así es esa mi fortuna es ese mi castigo
Será que tanto amor acaso esta prohibido
Yo sigo aquí muriendo por estar contigo

Por amarte así a un paso de tu boca y sin poder besarla
Tan cerca de ti piel y sin poder tocarla
Ardiendo de deseos con cada mirada
Por amarte así por amarte así por amarte

Así voy caminando en esta cuerda floja
Por ir tras de tu huella convertida en sombra
Precio del amor que me negaste un día
Contando los segundos que pasan por verte
Haciéndote culpable de mi propia suerte

The flowers are gone, trees are dead

Hear the echoes fill the night
Big bang making the walls come down
For the children of the light

Ana Johnsson,"Seven years since we first fell in love
Seven years since my heart came undone
Oh the memory still makes me warm
'cause I love you still

And I will learn to go on
I'll smile when I'm expected to
I know I will
Yeah, I will learn to move on
But I love you still

So they say that all wounds heal with time
Then how come time is not healing mine?
It's like you've locked yourself into my mind
And I love you still

How I wish I could go back
I'd never let us make the same mistakes again
How I wish I'd take you back
'cause I love you still

Been counting endless nights and days
You're hundred thousands miles away
But I feel you
I feel you
And what I feel will never change
All tomorrows for one yesterday
'cause I love you still
Yeah, I love you, love you still

I'm pretending to be strong
Fooling myself everyday saying I'm ok
When there's mothing left I will hold on
I will love you still 
I will love you still
",Still,2007
Ana Johnsson,"Couldn't move a mountain but, what if
Couldn't be an angel nor a goddess
There's so many stories we'd love to believe
But all I ever can be is me
There's a devil inside us all
But I believe in the beautiful

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
When tomorrow comes
We could be the ones
Who make miracles
What if

Saw you on the news today, crying
I just wanna turn you off, keep denying
Waiting for a wind to change to pull me right in
And while I'm waiting you're under my skin

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
When tomorrow comes
We could be the ones
Who make miracles
What if

There's a devil inside us all
I still believe in the beautiful
(what if)
(what if)

We can't change today
Undo yesterday 
Make it go away
But what if
When tomorrow comes
We could be the ones
Who make miracles
What if
(2x)

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if

Couldn't save the world today...
But what if...

Ana Laan,"Please, don't talk
My mind is out for a walk
Just go on touching me

Feel your way
Baby, make my day
Just go on touching me

Paradise sounds pretty nice
But nothing could be better than this
Nothing could be better than this

Hold me tight
Honey you're getting it right
Just keep on loving me

Don't be shy
Your clever hands don't lie
Please, please, keep on loving me

Istanbul sounds wonderful
But nothing could be better than this
Oh no nothing could be better than this

Mani, mani
Caserita no te acuestes a dormir
Sin comer un cucurucho de mani

Mani
Caserita no te acuestes a dormir
Sin comer un cucurucho de mani

Take your time
Hard and slow is fine
Lay your hands all over me

Make it last
There's no need to go fast
Just lay your hands on me

Hollywood sounds pretty good
But nothing could be better than this
Oh no, baby, nothing could be better than this

Your clever hands never lie
Nothing could be better than this
Don't stop now
Nothing could be better than this

Ana Laura,"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, oh yeah
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your light into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you are my truth
My world is a better place because of you

I'm everything I am
Because you loved me",Because You Loved Me,2006
Ana Laura,"The secret of life is letting go
The secret of love is letting it show
In all that i do, in all that i say
Right here in this moment
The power of prayer is in a humble cry
The power of change is in givin my life
And laying it down, down at your feet
Right here in this moment

Take my heart
Take my soul
I surrender everything to your control
And let all that is within me lift up to you and say
I am yours and yours alone
Completely

This journey of life is a truth for truth
This journey of faith is following you
Every step of the way
Thru the joy and the pain
Right here in this moment

Take my heart
Take my soul
I surrender everything to your control
And let all that is within me lift up to you and say
I am yours and yours alone

Right here right now
And for the rest of my life

Ana Laura,"I can feel you change,but I cant change the way you feel
I know this might sound strange,but I'm waiting for you still,if you
Believe your lost you're voice
In a sea of fear and doubt, I'll try to cut through all the noise, with all
The hope I've found
(chorus)
Don't run away,don't let yourself fade away
If you could see yourself the way he sees you now
You'd see his love,so hide away, don't let yourself break away
His arms are strong enough to hold and lift you up

You 'l feel his love,so don't run away

I know you'll find the strength, if you just believe
That there's a better way, it's easier than it seems
It's up to you to make the choice, you I'm always here
Can you here me trough the noise, calling loud and clear
So don't run, he's waiting there for you, to come
He's reaching out for you,so don't run away
His arms are strong enough to hold and lift you up
You 'll feel his love.",Don't Run Away,2006
