The Notorious B.I.G.,"Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nordstrom Ave niggas
My Fulton Street niggas (hardcore for ninety-six)
Dangerous MC's

Uhh (check it out) uhh
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is

Y'all niggas know the rules
I blast on niggas so

My fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that loud
Gold tooth shine like taa-dow
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' 'bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead lead to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)
Missed you by pinches (HOO) your talk is senseless (RRUFF)
Actor needs chiropractor (HAH, HOO) for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked your chatterbox (hah)
Dangerous you're not I gets down (HOO)
Twist your body round and round, upside down

C'mon, yo, throw your hands c'mon
Bitch grab your tits c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon
Thugs tote yo' shit
We 'bout to get mo' rich, c'mon
Let's close the club, c'mon
Fuck the place up, c'mon
Shake yo' nasty ass

My nigga this be the shit, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon

Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggas grab your dicks, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon

C'mon, yo, throw your hands c'mon

Follow me, I slip 'em slide 'em rip 'em ride 'em provide 'em
With that West coast G shit, L.B.C. Shit

And buy brand new whips and shit, uh-huh (beyotch)
I bet you didn't know that yo' bitch was suckin' dick (say what?)
Who you think she fuckin' with? (What?) Look here
My, Eastside lifestyle is way foul, move the crowd
Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, blaa-dow
How you like me now? (What what, what?)

Won't believe this voodoo
Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer
I love to cock the Glock-a, stack up on loot and vod-ka
And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggas full of ca-ca
The way we doin' damage tell me how the fuck you manage
With my niggas who marinate on foul thoughts and think savage
Them niggas'll throw you in a manhole
And push they hand in yo' ass
And pull yo' head right out yo' asshole!
Parkay nigga we rugged all day nigga
You ready to fuck bitch? Fuck the foreplay nigga
This me for all consumers, my nigga fuck the rumors
Three in the worst way of pure coke for all you drug abusers

To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that booty is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we lovin (that's alright)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger lovin in the park
{Piss}y off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo feet
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I {hit} that
Way she used to giggle when yo booty would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo freakin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Chick keep yo chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his {hoes}, go to my door
Then they go to his flo, to love some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh

I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3 - R. Kelly]

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at? 
Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime your ready, check it!

I got seven Mac 11's, about eight
38's, nine 9's, ten Mac 10's, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches, even if you had
MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weedspot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lamb spread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK
I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin' babies at they christening

Motherfucking Biggie Smalls
What you gonna do with it 2Pac?
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfucking middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this

I thank the Lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a MacK 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, hold up
A straight soldier, bucking at the busters
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I - wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker, that you ever saw",Biggie/Tupac Live Freestyle,1999
The Notorious B.I.G.,"Uh uh uh
We are lovers true and through and though
We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searchin' for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love

Oh, when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me to want some real love

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love

I got to have a real love
Loves so true and oh baby
I thought your love was true
I thought you were the answer to
The questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe
I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards
A love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring, and fall

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free (real love)
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love

You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'Cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free

The Notorious B.I.G.,"And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?

It's on me
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed ""thug life"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?",Runnin,2000
The Notorious B.I.G.,"As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I want to sex
I'd probably go to jail
For fuckin' Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
The jeans they fittin' like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'mma show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm takin' no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. wit telepathy
The recipe of picture hardcore wit a gun
Pimpin' ain't easy but it Sure is fun
When I bust my nuts
I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun?

Did Raven Simone call date rape?
Only 'cause I'm paid
I'm fuckin' all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
Everybody... move your body
Got Whitney Houson boostin' from Bobby
As I bust your cherry yo face lookin' scarry

Smacked Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and

Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said

Had a dream I said, bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a well as even I said
""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself""
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
""Just keep doing your thing,"" he said, say no more

Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at ridin'
Passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed, for all my homies in the pen
Many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'

Still ballin' until I die (until I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'

Now, as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin'
But when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'
With clientele, any rhyme sales
Question is: Will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em ""Thug Life"" was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

Until the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true

Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
‘Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, Tanqueray and Hennesey,
Until I call Earl, 10 months in this gut, what the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York, New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st, 2:19 was when my momma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck,
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out i'm bringin' mad joy,
The doctor looked and said he's gonna be Bad Boy!

I remember back in time, 
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere

Its like Moulin Rouge,
High fashion, up town Air Force Ones,
And Vasquez, Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S Classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to Manhattan,
With that Broadway actin', you hype that 
belly shit'd get you capped, and wrapped in plastic,
Tell the captain, ask Rog' what's happennin',
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the Magnum

Or on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
Risk it, ruptured spleens, by the age of 16,
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school I didn't show up, and fuck my flow up,
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself,
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was necessary,
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary,
C74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail,

Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead

It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero {uhh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed

Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uhh}

Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)

You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues

They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times

To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be no mo'
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

We hit the crib so I can drop my macadoshar shit like the blunt clip
And recognize a pimp read Mr. speak the G's obsolete don't sleep bang the skims in the week
On the creep of the avenue I seen her on the block who she rappin to?
That's my nigga D damn he got G now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me see

Now I play her far like a move player star
She still sweatin' me hard because I'm a rap star
I be cruisn up the block I be passin her 
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call to hang, is when me 
And deep blood is up scheming on the gang bang
She shoulda used her intuition 
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position
Listen she sayin' I dissed her cause I'm fuckin' her sister
A message to the fellers that gets some piss uh
But she started that fuckin' family
She fucked ma man D so why she mad at me?
Fuckin sister look better than you, 
Give head better than you, pussy, gets wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

Red bones to lift ons dubies hip huggers to show off ya booty I'm hangin' with
The best of them sleep
If you want I'm a veteran when I show up to the club it's V-I-P
I'll be dancin' in the club if it's B.I.G
I'm not lookin' to find a wife, just someone to make a friend of mine

Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Don't you know, I'm the ultimate?
To get this milk, you be fortunate
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it
People stop, when I'm walking in
I'm twisting, twisting, I'm back on ten
And I'm talking 'bout like Mase, come back again

My steez is immaculate
My paper stacking, keep tracking
I'm macing, y'all slacking, reaction
Make y'all dicks scream
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures
More bigger then Jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons

Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke
Thrillons, me won't give you none
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, get high, baby

Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke
Three lines, me won't give you none

Now, Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business
I like the kind who wine and dine, who grinding all the time
Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime

What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt

Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
Me and my friends, got your Benz
Attracting mens, and spending dividence, blowing like the wind

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya

So I guess, you think I'm slipping, 'cause I ain't flipping
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference?

It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall

All I do all day is drink Tanguray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek

Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger

You'd better slow your role, baby
You ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pen number, just page me
When you're real, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot

Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack

Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin' to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do
But stay true, sippin' 22's a brewin'now the medias tryin'
To test me got the press askin' questions, tryin' to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind's state

We run the city

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Niggaz got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
... if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

[Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)
Workin out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
Uh-huh

Tattoo on tittie saying ""B-I-G"". Now check it:
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
Another intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino ho, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fucking everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Pay my own bail, commence to ass-kickin'
Lick in the door, waving the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""

Play me like a chicken, thinking I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killing than the stick-up jukes
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cumming down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not trying to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots

Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nuttin' left to do but send her home to you
I'm through can ya sing the song for me, boo?

(One more chance) one more chance
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
Give me one more chance
(One more chance)
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
(one more chance)

So, what's it gonna be, him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crush linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp; I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion, flyin' into all states
Sexin' me while ya man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewind
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president

(One more chance) I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know

All I need is one more chance
I can help you find yourself (You don't need nobody else)

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec
12"" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it 'cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

[Chorus]

Ah, Yo
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, fam, bigger Bust of the stand if you can't reach

Uhhh, uhhh
Fox then B.I.G.
Who fucking with Fox, who want it with I
Bust a shot for me and Big from the villfredo sky
Got my Joan Fross shit on, hop off my dick
Canary bangle-round I ain't gon' 20 carrots on this bitch
Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six
Bed-Stuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 Jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
'Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
And no Stranel ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill nuns squeezing the lhama
Bog roll dutty, Fox and Poppa

Ralph Tresvant
Biggie Smalls
Listen

Uh yeah baby ooh, listen to me, oh yeah

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the 'Thriller in Manila'
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' ""Ay papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drug flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you did, where you are
You're with a star

Bitches screamin' they want that old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love to hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to comin' together is crazy
How come you and your sister make similar faces 
When y'all cummin' y'all be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows there's a bigger picture than the camera rollin'
'Cause I don't think y'all be knowin' how the shit's unfoldin'
Back shots to the rear, got the MAC unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
But we so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back (Shit)

She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E&J and Ginger Ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hun's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressin' 'em, I'm undressin' 'em

Fulfillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split, shit

The Notorious B.I.G.,"The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun, it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so naturally 
Up next was me but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends! yet still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
Cause I be doing the most, oh no
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back, oh no

I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée
Mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the Name of Love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing

It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
Cause I be doing the most, oh no
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back, oh no

I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
What the game did to my pulse with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-lookin corpse, of course

I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
Cause I be doing the most, oh no

Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubble-goose
Now I got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we want to know is ""where the party at?""
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Betta throw my vest on my chest

Niggas want to flex, who got the gat? (biggie!)

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum

My man big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""let's leave calm""
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like lil' shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of don perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone

Ever since I was an embryo, waitin' to shape up and ship out 
Somethin' in my brain said, ""Wake up and kick out!"" 
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out 
'Cause when I came, I was draped up and dripped out 
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out 
Peace out, A-Town gone and then I dipped out 
And, oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out 
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out 
Somebody get him, the lil' nigga's out of control 
Put a lil' bit of rum in my bottle; I'll dream about diamonds and gold 
Gold, gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent 
The essence of adolescence got my body feelin' fresh'n 
Fresh'n, fresh'n, and it was a blessin' to rhyme and start reppin'
I was the best in my section with flows harder than erections 
Still the best, but now I'm grown with more range than a tec's 
And I'm a heavyweight; you niggaz is lighter than my complexion

That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word 
Say, the ice is cool but them pots is hot 
You better cook slow but that money come fast 
I got what you need; I hope you brought all the cash 
You know the kid pimpin' all over the world 
A hundred carats got me all over your girl 
Yeah, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag 
A corporate thug; I run with a Playaz Circle 
I got a Field Mob that'll disturb your peace

Finish countin' my bread, and I was gettin' some head

Pickin' up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown 
Only reason you on that song is 'cause I turned that down 
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys 
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's 
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions 
From hangin' on the block to throwin' parties in the Hamptons 
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a 
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no Marta 
From dice on the curb to stackin' up chips, but harder 
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick! 
Guard your women, dog 
I went from ashy to classy 
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doin' the nasty 
Reach your hand up in the air, and you can play with the stars 
It's not the hand that you're dealt, but how you're playin' your cards, boy!

With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts
Dyin' aint the s***
But it's pleasant kinda quiet
Watch my n****s bring the riot

Came from the heavens just to sing a song for you
To the rhythm of my love for you,
And now it's beating slow, and you know
This the end of the road when I sing this slow song for you you
And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go,
I don't know, you can hear them callin, don't you,
When the angels call like

Yo
If you don't wanna stay you can goo
But since love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low,
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)

When the angels call like (i answer)

Calling, for you, I will tell the angels now
Let them turn back in to stone
I do, love you, it's true
Fire, climbing

They were warnings after all
It's cool, if I, pick you

went from grams to kilos
Mac in one hand, in the other hand grands and see-notes
game got my eyes wider than a 430 Buggy
no tellin' what the fuck I'll do for this money
stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
the thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
as I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
palmin' hammers
think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
takin' over with the Mafia
hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
the cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
confront frontin' niggas like ""You want it? well nigga, me too""
what the fuck, I'm callin' your bluff, niggas act like they stopped
makin' guns after they made yours
I'm sponsored by the NRA, DOA rules
grin and stand over your coffin like ""Hey you!""
tell the Devil I'm comin', keep it hot
for now I got my eyes on a billboard spot
don't stop.

take the stand, lie for it
blow trial, get up in the chair and fry for it

I buy and sell bricks with my nigga P.D.
down with the team called B.B.E.
now if you want to join the team you know you must see me
buy ya can't talk to FEDS or dick R.I.D. 
It's a cold World baby boy, fuck it, I'm colder
Animals on my back keep my warm, my armor
Frank Lucas persona, warmin' coke up in the sauna
let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
infact it's drastic
a couple Million in the mattress
with a safe dick I say fuck taxes
rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
crime pays 
nigga, Nine-Hundred and Ninety-Nine ways
my destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
while my enemies smile, buried in style
Gucci suits and cufflings
sneakin' drugs through Heavens customs.

stretch the Caine, to cop the house and the plane
'till my Massacre, slain
brains hang from the window of my Range
fuck the FEDS, 2 green and one red
Firm tight, hold the dice in this game of life
Aces suffice
paper's a must
Fallen Angels and Angel dust
my team do dirt to avoid layin' in the dust
Million dollar portraits in my fortress
of course it's Po
bloodstainin', aeroplanin', Four-Hundred horses slow
Platinum cable, round table, so all the bosses know
I'm takin' over 
'cause they coke got too much bakin' soda
they say money ain't everything
you fuckin' right nigga, it's the only thing
in God we trust, the Holy thing

Chorus 2x",The Commission,2014
The Notorious B.I.G.,"To sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honey's call me Bigga, the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit

I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the Ep along by James Todd
Smith I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift

Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean

I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter skinny or fat or

Light skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' ""Aiy papi""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa

Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck Tae Kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see

All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newton
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia

So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him

Old thing back
Like B I double G I E, with some R U L E
Notorious know to bust in your E Y E, baby baby
Bitches know they love and hate me

I come, you come, we come with back some maybe
How close we came to coming together is crazy
How come you ain't your sis with similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches

You know there's a bigger picture than the camera rolled
'Cause I only got to knowin' how the shits unfolded
Back shots through the rear, got the mack unloaded
Got a reload, like every so-often

Sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
But we so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him

Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass

Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL
The E&J and Ginger Ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamin's
Another hun's in the crib, please send her in

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips a lot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though

I got the cleanest, meanest, penis
Ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the Spandex and hit my man next

Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressin' 'em, I'm undressin' 'em

Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split, shit

I told him 'bout my baby and he let me go, thanks a lot.
I got invited to a party at a high class Hollywood pool.
There were women all around me, man I began to drool.
I weighed the evidence in hand, I said girls you got to understand.
Since I met my baby I've been living by the golden rule.

The Nudes,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

And all that rat-race noise down in the street

At night, the stars put on a show for free
And only you can share it all with me

I keep telling you that right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this whole world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof
Up on the roof

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, babe, come on, baby, up on the roof
Come on, baby, come on, baby, up on the roof

Come on, baby, come on, baby, up on the roof
Come on, babe, come on, babe, up on the roof
Up on the roof

Smooth away that frown

We were such a happy go-lucky pair
All the dreams we shared
I can't believe it's true, after all that we've been through
Please don't go
One thing I'm certain of, I have no doubt
People need each other, that's what life's about
And oh, if we can try then baby by and by
We can work it out

Please let down your guard
Life can be so hard
And we could always help each other
You've got no reason to cry
This is not goodbye
For I will always love you

My love is an open book
If you take a look you can read between the lines
I smile and say 'I'm doing fine'
Please don't go
Don't you know, baby if you go
A part of me will never be the same no more
Turn around, let's try it
Just one more time

Please don't leave me this way
There's still so much to say
And we could always talk together
You've got no reason to cry
This is not goodbye
For I will always love you
Don't you know I care

Care about you yes I do baby, I'm still your friend
What we have to share
Share a dream now there's no end, can never end

Not heard but perceived from within
A feeling inside that just can't be denied
Says the countdown is soon to begin

But in the darkest hour the human spirit
Sings ancient songs to me
The tyrants will gather to worship their master
But he will be brought to his knees

This war that you make is not ours
You sit at the left hand of those who are lying
Seducing with hypnotic powers

But now your stone cold heart has started rumbling
A song has risen free
And we shall not stop with the laughter and singing
'Til you have been swept to the sea

We run with the spirit that moves through the city
The heart of the jungle is whole
The seekers of truth with the hot blood of youth
Together we're never alone

To love with all its might
The chains will be broken, the doors will burst open
And we shall know the power of the night

She don't love you

You're just a stepping stone

The love you think you see
Deep in her eyes
Is filled with misery
Her love's a lie

She's just a woman
But before the main event
She may look like an angel
But she's far from heaven sent

(Beware) You're just a decoy
(Take care) To reel the bigger fish in
She'll treat you like a toy
She'll break you in the end

She's playing her own game

You better, you better, you better, you better watch out boy
You better, you better, you better, you better watch out boy

So many people loving so many lovers
Takin' everybody to some strangers place

Don't get me wrong I've had my share of affairs
I've had some hot nights singin' one night stands
But right up front I think it's only fair
To tell you I've got different plans

That's not the way I am
I'm not that kind of man
It's not that I am shy
I'm just not that kind of guy
So if you feel the same
You're tired of playing games
Then try to understand
That I'm not that kind of man

A lot of people take their loving too lightly
They change emotions like they're changing their clothes
They come alive and thrive on new lovers nightly
How they do it I don't know, 'cause

If you see him standing on the edge of the action
You think he's only playing it cool
He's only looking for a little sweet satisfaction

Holding up the walls with hot and hungry eyes
Don't be afraid to say hello to a stranger
You just might like your surprise

Just to think we fell in love
When there's no moon at all

But since it was Sunday and sunny I went for a stroll
The peanuts and pigeons and people put me in a hole
A blessing refreshing in you did unfold
Dispelling depressing distressing thoughts from my soul

Once was a time I thought
Love could be sold or bought
Everything fell in place for me
The fashion the passion I rationed with caution
Because of the notion the potion of passion
Had never been passed to me

But now with you by my side
I find that I'm so satisfied
Somebody must have lied to me",Once Was a Time I Thought/No Moon at All,1996
The Nylons,"You leave in the morning
With everything you own
In a little black case
Alone on a platform
The wind and the rain
On a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand
Why you had to leave
For the love that you need
Will never be found at home
And the answer you seek
Will never be found at home

Pushed around and kicked around
Always a lonely boy
You were the one
That they'd talk about around town
As they put you down
And as hard as they would try
They'd hurt to make you cry
But you'd never cry to them
Just to your soul
No you'd never cry to them
Just to your soul

The Nylons,"I crashed in the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted and my girl in Lover's Lane

Meanwhile, back in the States
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby, just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle
The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was cooking gear
I smelled something cooking and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was cookin' me
Ooga booga, lemme outta here!

Meanwhile, back in the States
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle
I jumped out of the pot, I finally got away
I was frantic, worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
My chance of surviving was gettin' slim
So I thumbed down a whale that was headed my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
When I got to Lover's Lane I was almost dead
Heard him talkin' to my baby, and this is what he said

Baby, baby, the man's no good
Baby, baby, should have understood
You can trust me just as long as you please
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
'Cause I love you (I love you, I love you, you're fine baby)
'Cause I love you (So damn fine)

Said to my shock 'You're on the wrong block'

Hello, hello, it's me, Picasso,
I gave you a call and I'm neat,
But you must know I'm asking you nothing.

I gave you a call, to tell you what I feel now.
Hello, my love, it's me, happiness.
Hello, hello, it's me again, Picasso,

Through the day, take off early
And a cut in pay

At the time, I don't really care
Because I done took
All that I can bear

And many times her eyes fought back the tears, yeah, yeah
And when her youthful world was about to fall in

Each time her slender shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears and a sorrow no one hear
Still rings in midnight silence in her ear

Let her cry for she’s a lady
Let her dream, she’s a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

And if by chance I should hold her, hold her
Let me, let me hold her for a little while
And if I had but one possession, possession
I would take her from the garden to be mine, oh, yeah, yeah

Be careful how you touch her for she night awaken
And sleep is the only freedom that the little girl knows
And when you walk into your eyes, you won’t believe

The way she’s always payin’
For a debt she never, never owed
And the silent wind still blows
But only she can hear, and so she goes

Let her cry, oh, for she’s a lady
Let her dream, she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

Let her cry, cry for she’s a lady
Let her dream and dream and dream and dream, she’s a child

We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, ""Baby, we can’t go on this way""
She said, ""You’re right""
I said, ""I know you love me and I love you""
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

We’re not the only people in the world
Who go through ups and downs
All we have to do is talk
We can work it out

Oh, oh, let me kiss your eyes
Let me wipe your tears away
Let me hold you tight
Tomorrow we’ll feel better ‘cause it’s a brand new day

Oh, last night me and my woman
We cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Now we had times when we'd laughed hearty
We’d even go out on the town and we’d party, party, party

Every day the sun doesn’t shine
Sometimes it has to rain
Just like we enjoy the pleasure
We have to stand the pain

Oh, let me kiss your eyes
Let me wipe the tears away
Oh, let me hold you close
Let’s talk to each other, I wanna hear what you gotta say

Oh, last night, sweet last night, me and my woman
We cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, together
And then we, and then we, and then we
And then we made love, love, love, ooh

Love like we never made love before
You know we stopped huggin’ each other and kiss
And I wiped the tears from my face
And I'm love all over the place

All the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout

You know the family is the solution to the world's problems today
Now let's take a look at the family
In the family the father is like the head, the leader, the director
Not domineering, but showing love, guidance
For everyone else in the family
Now if we could get all the fathers of the world
To stand up and be fathers
That would be great
Then we have mothers
Who are the right arm of the father
They're supposed to-to-to do the cooking
Raise the children, do the sewing
And help the father to guide and direct
Then there's the son
The son, most sons are like imitators of their father
So we're back again to the father
And he is guiding in the right way
The son is definitely gonna be alright
Then we have the daughter
Watching her mother
Be-because sooner or later she's gonna be a mother
And she'll have her own sons and daughters
It don't, it don't just stop there with the family or
Of-of yours or mine
It's a universal family
Under one divine purpose
And one divine father
That is if we all come together no matter what color, race, creed
Because that's all in the head whether you wanna believe it or not
'Cause you'll bleed

Hoo...

And I’m singin’ my song, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing a song, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

She faced the hardest time you would imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears, yeah, yeah
And when her youthful world was about to fall in

Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow, no one hears, still rings in midnight silence in her ear

Let her cry for she’s a lady, let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her, she’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

And if by chance I should hold her, hold her
Let me, let me hold her for a little while
And if I had but one possession
I would take her from the garden to be mine, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

Be careful how you touch her for she might awaken
And sleep is the only freedom that the little girl know
And when you walk into her eyes, she won’t believe

The way she’s always payin’ for a debt she never, never owed
And the silent wind still blows but only she can hear
And though she goes

Let her cry, ah, for she’s a lady, let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her, she’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

Let her cry, cry for she’s a lady
Let her dream and dream and dream and dream, she’s a child
Let the rain fall down upon her, she’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again

And there is love, oh, there's love

Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life?
For if loving is the answer then who's the giving for?
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before?

These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2008
The O'Neill Brothers,"There's a time each year
That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes
Good old summertime
When your day's work is over
Then you are in clover
And life is one beautiful rhyme
No trouble annoying
Each one is enjoying
The good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime

Oh, to swim in the pool
You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie
Good old summertime
Those days full of pleasure
We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries
In good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime",In The Good Old Summertime,2008
The O.C. Supertones,"Paul was walkin' on the road to Damascus
A big bright light and the Lord came and asked him
Darkness to light, come follow Me
And after he was blinded, he could finally see
I once was lost, 'til the Lord came in
He captured my heart and took away my sin
And now I'm living for Jesus 'cause of all He's done
God gave mercy through His only Son

And then He found me

No fears there, no years there

I'm going to Heaven
We're going to Heaven
Our tickets are all paid to heaven that God made
So goodbye blue Monday, no pain on SONday

I don't need no women or wine

Livin' in the future, livin' in the past
I haven't always been in Christ
I know what you're goin' through, man
A couple of years ago I was just like you
Lookin' for answers, but lookin' to myself
Thinkin' that Christians just love Jesus for their health

But, I didn't know about Jesus
I tried to be like God, but when I tried I failed
And every time I fail, and fail
I know I rail a nail straight into the cross of Jesus
Straight into the wrist of Jesus
And now it's 1996, a hard year to be a Godly man
It seems the more I speak The Word, the less they understand
You gotta know about Jesus

A high-rise to the blue skies my piece of the pie
There's a hole in my heart that I know how to fill

It's all about cash flow the California dream
To make the grade you gotta make the green
My friend I'm the champion I've no time for losers
Never ask for nothin 'cause beggars can't be choosers
Lookin' our for number ones's a full time occupation
I'll give to me myself and I my own salvation
Some people try to tell me God can save me from my sin
ut God can take a number and I'll pencil Him in
Busy oh so busy I got no time to search
My Sunday's are all booked I've got no time for church
That's for those poor souls, dry as a stone
God bless this child 'cause this child's got His own.
Oh, let my pride fall down I'm a little man
He who gets the most toys and dies is the winner
I'm livin' the high life with lobster tail dinners
My Lexus, my yacht, my gold chains and rings
These are a few of my favorite things
But most of all I keep my billfold the closest to my heart
House decorated with million dollar works of art
Roll with the Bigwigs they think I'm the man
But then I stop and look and think about how big I really am
Mammon is an unforgiving God, I cast him away
I live my life to God, not to get paid

I've gotta get it right this time
This time my God I will be Yours,
All my heart, my soul, and mind
Been so long since I truly smiled
But You touched my heart today
Reached through my mind of mud and mire
Consumed the idols in Your way
So I am brand new Today, I make my resolution

Been down so long that is seems like up,
I took it now I've had enough
Of the life that I've been livin'
It feels so cold this far away
So Today I will make a change
I will make a change today

It was just me and God
Can I be there again?

Believer in Christ, yes, yes, the blessed fountain
Apologetic warrior, chalk one up for the visitors
Casting fierce some light into the shadows of midnight

To the underground we descend
With our whole generation to defend
Got a whole army on my case, got the devil in my face
'Cause that punk knows when is the end

Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright
The sight will blind the blind of this our modern time

Oh yeah, I got a beef with the fence sitters
Tiers among the wheat, the cop outs, the quitters
Cut from the branch fruitless, no good
Only one use and that's firewood

Pay no mind to the generation line
Forsake your sect and be color blind
The problem's not Hollywood, the problem's not Washington
The problem's a weak divided church of schizoids Christians

Never going back the the darkness I was damned in
Now I turn my back on the place that I was found in
Flick a match on Babylon, burn baby burn
Raised my mind for all this time and now it's your turn

Got enough gasoline and plenty ol' matches
Finally I'm free and I shake off the ashes
From the city of refuse, I refuse to pay dues
To you, not me, and none of the free and the few

The O.C. Supertones,"Welcome to the epicenter,
Where we got spring and summer,
But we skip the winter.
Feel free to enter
The zone of the Supertones,
Where late into the night we just
Rock the microphone.
We lived inside the fault lines
Beneath the earth's surface.
Spendin' all our time
Readin' books and writin' verses.
The earth stated shakin'
From the noise we were makin'.
We emerged from the rubble,
OC was taken.
With the music came the message,
So we rock the verbs.
Still neutral as a nazi
So you forget what you heard.
We never leave the cross behind,
We use it as a banner,
Scripture the vernacular,
Jesus in the grammar.
Throw your hands up,
Throw your hands up high!
Tear the roof off and pull down the sky!
Chase the sun back to California,
Tears in my eyes.
Tell me where you're from,
The mighty west side!
Let me continue
To lighten up the mood a little.
Never number one,
But never playin' second fiddle.
My thoughts are like a circle,
With Jesus in the middle.
Rhyme for a reason,
I don't rhyme to riddle.
High emotions are like I'm yellin',
No need to be alarmed.
SUPERTONES is what your smellin'.
If lovin' you's a crime,
Then baby I'm a felon.
Where we go from here,
My people, there's no tellin'...
Are you ready to go
When it's time to get
Back on the road just to see you?
On this narrow path
We got no time to dally.
Follow my lead
And chase the sun back to Cali.




",Chase the Sun,1999
The O.C. Supertones,"Side by side
Driving the same highway
Leaving behind everything
And everyone you love
The cost to pay
To tell the world of jesus
Hoping that these bridges burned
Will not be just in vain

It helps to think that somewhere
You're feeling just the same
And don't take even
A moment for granted
Don't lose heart
When the world crashes down

How many miles ahead?
I can't count the ones behind
To all the friends that we've collected
All the people we respect
For the hope and joy
We made this up and wrote it down
And dedicate this song to you

No turning back
And can't say that I regret it
When every day
God's promises testify themselves
Sometimes it's hard
And the road keeps stretching longer
Tonight my wife's a longing voice
On a holiday inn phone

How many miles ahead?
I can't count the ones behind
I wish you god's speed, friend
You're always on my mind
Will you remember me, say
Seven years from now?
And where will we be then?

about our world today...
what needs to be said,
and what I need to say.
We're a tower of Babel
built on anti-philosophy,
Neitzche in the west
and Krishna in the east.

War rages on through generations.
All of these Christians
abandoned their stations.
A whole world around us,
and we've ceased to reach.
An army of soldiers,
we've neglected to teach.
But, it's dim and not pitch black.
The truth will prevail.
If our God is for us, how can we fail?
No surer hope has ever been rested.
But for our adversary's worthy,
prepare to be tested.

Hoo, Hah.
How will you stand
if you don't understand?

Hoo, Hah.
Fight like a man, scriptures in hand.

And here we stand
naked, barehanded futily prepared
for the blows to be landed.
Presuppositions is all you can stand on.
Can you twist their wrist
when they lay a hand on?
Learn how to fight
from words on a paper.
learn from the shoguns,
Bahnsen and Schaeffer.
Invincible army,
Holy Spirit our general.
Weapons are formed
from most precious of minerals.

Kids in universities,
drowning in an ocean
of apostate philosophy.
We need apologetic instruction...
mental reconstruction.
Ignorance reduction,
to halt the mass abduction.
Evangelical mind
has been scandalized.
Wisdom and truth
have been vandalized,
by the unevangelized.
No truth in a world
that is randomized.
Expose the lies
no matter how they're disguised.

Half of me slave, the other half free.
Righteous and sinful,
Both at the same time.
Iniquity and purity
Fill up the same mind.
And out of the same mouth,
The holy and profane.
I curse all my brothers,
Then I bless Christ's name.
I hang in the balance,
But still I'm secure.
I'm leaning towards evil,
But striving to be pure
I stand between the saint and the
Sinner, chasing after holiness, close
Enough to grasp, but still it's just
Beyond my reach.
Who I am is in between,
What I want to be and what I am.
Pulling from both sides,
Humility and pride.
One seeks to five,
The other to be gratified.
In any case, however,
I know I'm in need.
Two appetites in me,
Which on do I feed?
Running fast as I can
After elusive perfection.
No I'm not there yet,
But sure I'm in the right direction.
'cause I see me at the end
And I look glorified.
Justified safe inside,
So I seek to be sanctified.",In Between,1999

Show me how I can serve you today

Lord, my god, in the evening
Let my song rise up to you.

I know that you are holy,
I know that I'm unclean
And I'm afraid to come into your presence.
I know that I'm unworthy,
To call upon your name
From all the way down here.

So I say
Lift me up
From my lowly estate
Lift me up
Where I can see you clothed in majesty and light
(repeat)

If you'd saved even one man
Surely this is undeserved
But the saints by your mercy
Stand with you uncountable
Is this not amazing
Isn't your name grace
Aren't you the sovereign God of justice
Haven't we offended
Did we not crucify
Guess that we can only wonder why

So I say
Lift me up
From my lowly estate
Lift me up
Where I can see you clothed in majesty and light




",Lift Me Up,2000
The O.C. Supertones,"Pick your poison
Pseudo-christian, neo-orthodoxy, false philosophy
Triple-x pornography, lsd, pcp, self idolatry
Listen you can hear the laugh of mephistropheles
'cause once you start it's so very hard to cease
To say the least it's hard enough to keep it from increase
That's the box you can never close it once it's open
You can't contain what's inside once the seal is broken.

Chorus:
Who knocked the locks off of pandora's box
Praise apostate while they mock the orthodox

The box was opened first by adam and eve
Forbidden fruit tasted and planted the seed
Grew up into hatred, lust and greed
The pain of cain and his devious deed
It permeates society circling like a vulture
The lid's flung wide and we call it our culture
That's the box you can never close it once it's open
You can't comtain what's inside once the seal is broken




",Pandora's Box,2000
The O.C. Supertones,"Let me introduce you to somebody that I know
I first met him, oh, I'd say about nine years ago
But he knew me before the day that I was born
He planned my life when the world was void of form
He chose to save my soul before earth's foundations
Reigns from heaven as we speak and rules over the nations
The one and only god-man at the father's right hand
The height the length the depth tell me if you understand
The one and only undefeated champion
The only one who did what can't be done
The only one who can insure saint's persistence
Who swallowed up death in his infinite existence
Omnipotent infinite blood sufficient for what ails ya
Makes scores of saints sing praises like mahalia
Vital signs were flat lined in the earth three days time then
He rose again and ascended like sunshine

(chorus)
Who could it be who could it be the person of the trinity
Between one and three j-e-s-you-s see-h-are-I-s-t

Feared on every continent banned by many governments
Raise your voice against him and reveal your own
Incompetence
Many people hate him many people love him
Many far below him but you know there's none above him
Now there is an issue where I must turn my attention
It seems that people wish to serve a christ of their invention
True God true man otherwise you're anathema
Unsaved hell bound with a hellhound after ya

Deity one in three existing from eternity
Humiliated lacerated now reigning in glory
The comeback king of all time
No matter how dark it gets the truth shines
'cause in the heart of every man lies the knowledge of him
Displayed in creation but suppressed in sin
Don't believe me check out romans one to three
Still disagree you best check your theology




",Who Could It Be,2000
The O.C. Supertones,"The rain falls on the righteous and the wicked
Mine is not to reason why this is
In this I rest in this I find my refuge
That my thoughts and ways are not His
I spend my life on looking up the answers
It's rare that I can't find a reason why
But reasons fail at children without mothers
His plan is more than I can know

Have you ever held in doubt
What this life is all about
Have you questioned all these things that seem important to us
Do you really wanna know
Or are you a little scared
You're afraid that God is not really exactly what you'd have Him be
What should I hold to and what should I do
How do I know if anything's true
I'm somewhere in-between Canaan and Egypt
A place called the wilderness

I'm not one who always trusts their feelings
I don't believe in what you'd call blind faith
But faith that you can do all that you promised
And you said it all works for good
It's safe to say I don't see the big picture
I can't see the forest for the trees
And if five hundred lives
Were mine to get to know
You all could be spent on just this

God do you really understand what it's like to be a man
Have You ever felt the weight of loving all the things you Hate
Have You struggled have you worried
How can You sympathize

I have spoken too soon put my hand over my mouth
I can't contend with You
Your ways are so much higher
And we pass through the fire that Christ endured before us
When You were in the wilderness




",Wilderness,2000

Sensitizing that part of me,
I've been learning the difference,
Between attitude and identity.

I'm sorry about who I am,
I'm not who I'm trying to be.
For some reason my bad attitude comes so easily.

Love is like an addiction,
And I hope that I'm gettin' hooked.
Spread it like an infection,
Seein' Christ everywhere I look

It's not ok for me to be rude.

Your breaking down my defenses,
And I'm findin' I'm not so hard,

The O.C. Supertones,"Well, It's time like these
And it's days like this that remind me I'm living in the wilderness,
And you dont know when trouble's gonna come you way
Or when God's gonna give or take it away.

This life,
This life is fleeting everything,
Everything's dyin',
But one day I'll awake,
All my problems and my sin,
The won't mattter to me then,
""Son, welcome home.""

The day doesn't guarantee to come again,
And life only promises that it will end,
And we all gotta stand before the Lord one day,
And I don't wanna die but I don't wanna stay down here
I feel like a stranger,
I know, I don't belong here,
I wanna run and I'll fall down at Jesus' feet and Lay.
I can't way to here him say,
""Son, welcome home.""

(chorus)
But I'm still here,
And I'm tired,
tired of sin and struggling,
tired of almost everthing
and sometimes,
small and cleam
I could swear that I could hear
angels voices in my ear sayin' welcome home.

The O.C. Supertones,"Back in junior high, well, I was a bit wild
Pretty safe to say that I was a troubled child
Didn't go to Juvie but they had me on file
Drinking like a man, but thinking like a child

You wouldn't want to know me, man I was a hooligan
It was the only crowd who would ever take me in
Cared about nothing- that's the loser's way to win
I hit the ninth grade and something happened then

And it was a sacrifice
(Whoa-oa-oa)
There are those who give their lives

Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know
You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
I will follow.

I came to know my God first year of high school
Not a smart move if you're trying to be cool
They knew me as a druggie who wouldn't follow rules
My friends didn't get it and they thought I was a fool

They called me self-righteous 'cause I wouldn't smoke pot
And now I didn't wanna split a bottle of Schnapps
Plus I didn't wanna go running from the cops
And that's how I lost all the friends I got.

And it was a sacrifice
(Whoa-oa-oa)
There are those who give their lives

Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know
You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
I will follow.

So everyone I knew just thought I was a freak
I wasn't hard to tell that they didn't want to speak
I used to be cool, but now I was a geek
Like drugs are for the strong and God is for the weak

Everything I have, well, I gave it to the cross
I count it as trash, I don't hesitate to toss
What I held dear was a burden to be lost
To get to the gold you've got to burn up the dross

And it was a sacrifice
(Whoa-oa-oa)
There are those who give their lives

Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know
You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
I will follow.",I Will Follow,2004
The O.C. Supertones,"I was listenin in to your transmission (I hear it every night, hear it every night) 
I think there was a problem with my reception (on my satellite, on my satellite)

It seemed like a section of my soul was having trouble with the signal 

I was trying but it just wasn't pickin up 
I guess the frequency was stuck 
And my heart corroded shut

I couldn't tune in to the station that was telecasting my salvation...

But I wanna hear it now
And sing along again
I just don't know how 
I lost that frequency but now it's coming in.
Yeah it's coming in!

In a room full of doubters You were the sure one. (You were like a light, You were like a light)
In a town of compromises, You are the pure one. (I think You got it right, I think You got it right)

It was water to my soul to hear You singing so honest and simple

I seek to be sophisticated,
But I make it complicated
I over elaborated but now that I have contemplated
I'll write about the love of Jesus and his mercy that never ceases

And I wanna hear it now
And sing along again
I just don't know how 
I lost that frequency but now it's coming in.
Yeah it's coming in!

It was foolish to be jaded that the cross was intgraded 
I remember Jesus said you either love it or you hate it

I didn't know the words in my heart I was singing with You

And I wanna hear it now
And sing along again

Let it go and unleash the fury of my old school flow.
I'm no superstar more like a John Doe.
But I'm badder then the water down in Mexico.
Oh no, a rock n' roller man who's not allowed to be rap.
But I write what I like and I like the boom bap.

Are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall overcome.

I can't be shy I've gotta come with it.
No fear here! I Sing and bring it.
In Christ you've got no right livin' timid.
He's light in the dark and hope for the wicked.
There's a land of the dead called planet earth
And a race called man walks dead from birth
And the beast and man both bear the curse.
Come from the womb but retrun to dirt.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall over come.

Here's what I do I hope I get through.
So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.
These kids smoke weed, these kids that drink beers
Who don't want to hear what you got to say
And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
But I was empty.

It's just a thing of the past
But in this modern day that we're livin'
It's the only thing that will last

Well friend, that's alright with me
But I am so glad that I am a Christian
And from sin I have been set free

Well, I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

Not long ago, at an ole fashioned meetin'
I knelt on my knees there in prayer
He lifted my burdens, sin shackles fell from me
And His presence was so real everywhere

Now that this load that I carry is lighter
And He changed my gray skies to blue
My steps are now higher for I have this assurance
That His sweet love will carry me through

I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

Come go with me to that land over yonder
He's prepared for the pure and the true
It's a place where sickness and death cannot enter
I'm goin', brother, how about you?

Now maybe today or maybe tomorrow
He'll return in robes of pure white
I'm packin' up now, gettin' my things together
Who knows? It might be tonight

I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven

The Oak Ridge Boys,"There's a place near to me, where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With our friends at the old country church

As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
When I knelt in the old country church
And the Savior above, by His wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church

How I wish that today all the people would pray
As we prayed in the old country church
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did in the old country church

Of't my thoughts make me weep, for so many now sleep
In their graves near the old country church
And sometime I may rest, with the friends I love best
In a grave near the old country church

Oh, we'll rise to meet Him in the sky

About a love that long ago had withered up and died

Up in her room

There wasn't no sunshine on his back porch and no flowers in his yard

The Oak Ridge Boys,"Many months have come and gone
Since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned
Many a lesson I have learned
Yet I feel like in those hills, I still belong

[Chorus]
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born

But as I sit here today
Many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows

Rising up in the sky, telling this world goodbye

Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

Young love is such a special thing
It spoils the heart for less
But sure as time, all things must change
Not always for the best

With wicked ease, temptation breeds
A strong and binding spell
But the honeymoon is over when
You're out with someone else

'Cause a broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

This world is full of hungry eyes
But they can't turn your head
If you place the one you cherish
Far above the rest

For wild desires of careless fires
Where everyone gets burned
Just look at me and you will see
A lesson too late learned

Lay your weary head to rest

Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest

Carry on, nothing equals the splendor

Surely heaven waits for you

I first saw her standing on the corner of the stage and I've been pledging my allegiance ever since. We often take for granted her old familiar wave but that freedom cost a lot of brave young men and women.

It's one that's red as the bloodshed, blue as the wounded, white as the crosses on our soldier's graves. Through the rain, through the sun, these colors never run. No they never will.

Now I've seen people treat her like she was some old rag, clueless to the human sacrifice. But you'll always find a mother, a widow, a child, a sister or a brother with a carefully folded teardrop in their eyes.

Come on in, baby put a smile on, come on in, baby tell me what's wrong 
Come on in, the blues will be long gone I'm gonna love your hurt away

Don't brag about standing or you'll surely fall

If you're holding heaven, then spread it around
There's hungry hands reaching up here from the ground
Move over and share the high ground where you stood
So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good

The gospel ain't gospel until it is spread
But how can you share it where you've got your head
There's hands that reach out for a hand if you would
So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good

The Ocean,"There are moments in life
When man with his louse ridden hair
Casts wild staring looks
At the green membranes of space, for he believes
He hears, somewhere ahead

The wry hoots of a phantom
He staggers and bows his head
What he has heard is the voice of his own conscience
He is determined and alert
And with the speed of a madman he rushes out

Takes the first direction his wold state suggests
And bounds over the rough plains of the wield
But the yellow phantom never loses sight of him
Chasing him with equal speed, sometimes on stormy nights

When legions of winged octopi which look like ravens at a distance
Hover above the clouds, moving ponderously
Towards the cities of men, there in the dark
Their mission is to warn them on such nights the dark eyed grit

Sees two beings passing by one after another
And wiping a furtive tear of compassion
Which flows out from its frozen eye
It shouts out, ""Yes, certainly he deserves it
It is only justice being done"" having said that

He re-assumes his grim attitude and continues to watch
And continues to watch, trembling nervously, the manhunt
The phantom makes a clicking sound with its tongue as if to tell itself
It's giving up the chase, his is the voice of the condemned

And when its dreadful shrieking penetrates the human heart
Man would prefer to have death as his mom
Than to have remorse as his son, I have seen him
Making for the sea, climbing a jagged promontory

Lashed by the eyebrow of the surge
And flinging himself down, into the waves
The miracle is this, the corpse reappeared the next day
On the surface of the raging sea
Which had brought this flotsam of pale flesh back to the shore

The man freed himself from his body's imprint in the sand
He wrung the water from his drenched hair
The man freed himself from his body's imprint in the sand
Wrung the water from his drenched hair
And silently returned to the way of life

Has vanished in the haze of time

To phone you up and tell you of my find
But as I stretch my hand

I'm reminded of the shape I'm in
From all the things you've left
Behind

Man, I hate your friends
They really bring me down
And I can tell you're not yourself
Whenever they're around

So ditch this motley crew
For all the world of me
And leave these sorry few
Behind

I hope that by some master plan
You're in the same boat that I am
Waiting at a crossing path
To seal away your life

To lock inside a sacred bond so tight

The scattered thoughts of you
Are frozen in the amber of my mind

And boxes on the shelf of documents
Reminding me you
Left an empty shell

To my young body's aching desire

To the place that we would make our bed
And embracing in the blue moonlight

Lost days stand in the way

Your past away
And find another day

The Offspring,"Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it we are one

Dog eat dog
To get by
Hope you like my genocide
I find it such a shame

Through the pain I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
The pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time
We can see the errors of our ways

Would anyone change it anyhow

I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
There's one guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take

But I think it's kinda weak

I gotta get away from me

Avoiding my friends cause they all bug
Life is a riddle and I'm really stumped

It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground

I say I'm not that kind of person
I'm not that kind of man

I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack

If I thought that you were willing to give a little back

You do it in the night

Or has the slightest idea what it is that makes you be

Like someone else was keeping score
And what could make you whole was simply out of reach

Someday I'll get it straight but not today

There's someone around just a step behind
It's kinda scary, the shape I'm in
The walls are shakin' and they're closing in

Too fast or a bit slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
There's one guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's no more than I can take

I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me
I tell you something just ain't right

My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped

Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back but it's never coming back. And I thought I knew a better way. I'd lose myself in anything that could take away the pain. Years spent running and I never knew the cost. But shattered mirrors and broken hearts finally showed me what I'd lose. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back. We've all been lost before we've all been knocked to the ground. Let go of our regrets and find the strength to turn it around. I know it might seem far too late but we're just about to break these chains that have always held us back.

Everybody there thought she danced so great; 
I realized a thing or two, 
When I got wise to something new: 

When I looked at Kate, she was in a trance, 
And then I knew it was in her dance; 
All the boys are going wild 
Over sister Katie's style. 

Oh, I wish I could I shimmy like my sister Kate; 
She shimmies like a jelly on a plate. 
My mama wanted to know last night, 
What makes the boys think Kate's so nice. 

Now all the boys in the neighborhood, 
They know that she can shimmy and it's understood; 
I know that I'm late, but I'll be up-to-date 
When I shimmy like my sister Kate. 
I mean, when I shimmy like my sister Kate.

Who can let me wear a necklace with his initials?

The Ominous Seapods,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

And when you pick up the pace
But loosing the race

Probably end your heart though
Better to learn crashing by
Then never to fly at all
The chances are it falls apart
Sometimes it's over before it starts
Better to know crashing but 
Then never to fly at all

The ship doesn't sail
You try but you fail
Your lover keeps checking the mail
And whenever your down
From crying out loud
You'd rather see his face in the crowd
If you see the top 
You know it's making it there
Or if you didn't bring somebody who cares
Your a day to late or a minute to soon
Your stealing the stars

About it

It was a purple-purple sky and an orange-orange moon
And everyone was whistling the same damn tune
Except Brian, Brian staired out across the field
And watch the horizon blossom to cop a field
Over the edge of the world
The one they're all afraid to walk
Ration out the why they're so high on the small talk
But Brian knows where the crows all go
To find the if's, and the and's and the but's and also's

Chorus:
If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light
I?d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock
I?d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block
But as it stands, I stay content
Tryin? to be the magic man, and pay my rent
Wishing that Brian would turn me on to the secrets he sought
While we keep burning the dawn, just to keep the day hot 

[Verse 2 : Slug]
If I could ask you one question, I?d ask where you went
You could teach me a lesson every time I got bent
But the alcohol don't make me forget about it all
doesn't matter the season the leaves can still fall
They slipped hidden messages within the cards that were dealt
I understand myself and all of the sorrow I felt
For as simple as I'am how'd it get so complex
Got me studying the margins and disregarding the text
I open the curtins and listen to the traffic go
But I still get nervous each time my peace passes go
The residue is thick and the memory fails
I still laugh 'cause the path feels a lot like a trail

We used to be a couple of pimps walking the hallways with pride
Drunk or sober, life was nothing short of rollercoaster rides
Trip to the clubs, now the skull to the rhythm
All we wanted out of life was what was given
And when you passed I wanted to take back the time we wasted
I'd trade all the buzzes in for one more conversation
We can sit in the shade and discuss the meaning of sacred
Cause I can't see the garden no more, just the avens
But the wind still blows and the plains still grow
And I wish your name was on the guest list at my shows
I got to believe you can see me run up on my freedom
Cause you got to meet up with the son before you got to meet my son

Bridge (x2):
And when I see lightning, feels like my buzz is heightning
Everytime I feel the sun, I can smell the love
And when I smell the air I can hear a child trying
But everytime I hear a river I think the mother is crying

Oh, let my pride fall down I'm a little man
He who gets the most toys and dies is the winner
I'm livin' the high life with lobster tail dinners
My Lexus, my yacht, my gold chains and rings
These are a few of my favorite things
But most of all I keep my billfold the closest to my heart
House decorated with million dollar works of art
Roll with the Bigwigs they think I'm the man

This time my God I will be Yours,

Been so long since I truly smiled
But You touched my heart today
Reached through my mind of mud and mire
Consumed the idols in Your way
So I am brand new Today, I make my resolution

Been down so long that is seems like up,
I took it now I've had enough
Of the life that I've been livin'
It feels so cold this far away
So Today I will make a change
I will make a change today
Purge my mind of mud and mire
Cast all my gods away

It was just me and God
Can I be there again?

Believer in Christ, yes, yes, the blessed fountain
Apologetic warrior, chalk one up for the visitors
Casting fierce some light into the shadows of midnight

To the underground we descend
With our whole generation to defend
Got a whole army on my case, got the devil in my face
'Cause that punk knows when is the end

Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright
The sight will blind the blind of this our modern time

Oh yeah, I got a beef with the fence sitters
Tiers among the wheat, the cop outs, the quitters
Cut from the branch fruitless, no good
Only one use and that's firewood

Pay no mind to the generation line
Forsake your sect and be color blind
The problem's not Hollywood, the problem's not Washington
The problem's a weak divided church of schizoids Christians

Never going back the the darkness I was damned in
Now I turn my back on the place that I was found in
Flick a match on Babylon, burn baby burn
Raised my mind for all this time and now it's your turn

Got enough gasoline and plenty ol' matches
Finally I'm free and I shake off the ashes
From the city of refuse, I refuse to pay dues
To you, not me, and none of the free and the few

A couple of years ago I was just like you
Lookin' for answers, but lookin' to myself
Thinkin' that Christians just love Jesus for their health

But, I didn't know about Jesus
I tried to be like God, but when I tried I failed
And every time I fail, and fail
I know I rail a nail straight into the cross of Jesus
Straight into the wrist of Jesus
And now it's 1996, a hard year to be a Godly man
It seems the more I speak The Word, the less they understand
You gotta know about Jesus

And I know whatever we've got to do
Is something that can be done by two

I'll say it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day",It's a Lovely Day Today,1950
The Orchestra,"I would like you to listen
Pay attention and listen
To a story that's old, but never stale
I would like you to listen
Pay attention and listen
To a twentieth century fairy tale

Once there was a princess
Once there was a guy
And they fell in love one wonderful day

But she was a princess
He was just a guy
So there was the royal devil to pay

They were ordered not to speak to one another
And they knew the sorrow that would bring
Still, they promised not to speak to one another
But they didn't promise not to sing

So beneath her window tenderly he sang
All the things he promised never to say
Once upon a time today

He collected lots of corny little phrases
Like ""I love you, dear"" and ""You're for me""
But he found that when he set them all to music
They were just as good as poetry

So beneath her window tenderly he sang
""How about that happy ending in May?""

The Orchestra,"Be Careful, It's My Heart
Bing Crosby
Words and music by Irving Berlin
-From the musical ""Holiday Inn""
Sweetheart of mine, I've sent you a valentine.
Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine.
Be careful, it's my heart.
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.
Remember it's my heart.
The heart with which so willingly I part.
It's yours to take to keep or break,
But please, before you start,
Be careful, it's my heart.

When he sold the car
That took him away and back

Which he's cut together

Muffy, Alison

Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight

Maybe a bird told her or an angel

It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs

No, she was huddled in the park in the dark

Got a light, I know you, you're shivering

She's been living on the street
We need some heat
I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat

The Orchestra,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1959
The Orchestra,"Make believe you're in a jungle movie
Watch the baby elephants go by
The beat is groovy
It's a brand new dance you ought to try
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk

See the big baboon beat on the bongo
As the baby elephants advance
Down in the Congo
All the swinging monkeys do this dance
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk

If you plan on joining a safari
Don't get dressed for going on a cruise
The thing to carry is an extra pair of dancing shoes
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk",Baby Elephant Walk,1962
