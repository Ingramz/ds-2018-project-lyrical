Ella Fitzgerald,"On the first of may, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!

Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!

We could find no cleaner retreat from life's machinery
Then our mountain greenery home.",Mountain Greenery,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

I love you and you alone were meant for me
Please, give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart",For Sentimental Reasons,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in Lover's Lane
She strayed, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

When she woke up and found
That her dream of love was gone, madam
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her love down, madam
Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today

When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail, madam
They strung her upon the old willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today",Miss Otis Regrets,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care

And if I tried I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know for haven't I told you so
A million or more times

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now",You'll Never Know,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm confessin' that I love you
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you
Honest, honest, I do, I do, oh yeah

In your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I read such strange things
But your lips deny that they are true
Baby, will your answer really change things?
Making me blue

I'm afraid some day you're gonna leave me
Saying, why can't we still be friends?
If you go, you know you're gonna grieve me
'Cause all my life on you depends

I'm guessing, guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams, dreaming dreams, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming dreams of you in vain
Whoa, I'm confessin' that I love you
Over, over, over, over, and over again

Whoa, I'm afraid some day, some day you're going to leave me
Saying, baby, can we still be friends, old friends now?
If you go, if you go, you know you're gonna grieve me
'Cause all my life on you depends

I'm guessing that you love me, yeah

All over again, oh yeah",I'm Confessin' (That I Love You),1994

Can't keep my feet on the ground
Everything seems unreal now
When you're not around

Day Dream
Why do you haunt me so?
Deep in a rosy glow 
The face of my love you show

Day Dream
I walk along on air
Building a castle there
For me and my love to share

Don't know the time
Lordy, I'm in a daze

While I moon around, feeling hazy

Don't break my reverie
Until I find that he
Is day dreaming just like me

Ella Fitzgerald,"I want the waiter
With the water
I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
Cause my daughter has an order for some water on

Ella Fitzgerald,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?

As sure as I believe
There's a heaven above, Alfie
I know, I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in

I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed
You're nothing, Alfie

When you walk, let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie",Alfie,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life lets you hide 
All the sadness you feel

You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance

It's the good life 
To be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches 
When you learn you must face them alone

Please, remember, I still love you
And in case you don't know
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life ""hello""",The Good Life,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Mine was a simple story
Never a thought of glory
I did what I did and what I had
I was glad to posses

But you changed my whole direction
And now that I've seen perfection
How could I settle for less?

I was the shyest lover
Ready to run for cover
But look at me now
I'm not the same, I aim to impress

You gave me a glance at heaven
And given a change at heaven
How could I settle for less?

Could Caesar span Cleopatra's door?
Columbus turn once he saw the shore?

I, I don't want fame or treasure
Miracles made to measure
The beautiful things that people
Rate the greatest success

I only want you forever
And you and I close together
How could I settle for?
How, how could I settle?
How could I settle for less?

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me daddy, how could I settle for less?
I wanna know, I want to know
How could I settle for?",How Could I Settle For Less,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke kid
It's not a joke kid, it's a curse,
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
Simply rotten to something worst

Who knows, someday I will win too
I'll begin to reach my pride
Now, that I see what our end is
All can spend is just my time

I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby, dream a while
Scheme a while, we're sure to find happiness
And I guess all those things you've always pined for

Ella Fitzgerald,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?

Release your hold and I'll set you free""

Ella Fitzgerald,"What now, my love, now that you left me?
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay?
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb; I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now, my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now, my love, now that you're gone?
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die
What now, my love, now there is nothing?
Only my last goodbye, only my last goodbye",What Now My Love,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true

That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Ella Fitzgerald,"What good is sitting, alone in your room?
But come, hear the music play!
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!
Put down your knitting, your book and your broom
It is time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum!

Come to the cabaret!
Come taste the wine
Come hear the band 
Come blow that horn
Start celebrating
Right this way your table's waiting
What good's permitting some prophet of doom?
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
So come to the cabaret!

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours
The day she died the neighbours
Came to snicker her
Well, that is what comes from 
Too much pills and liquor

But when I saw her laid down like  a queen
She was the happiest corpes I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie till this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say
What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!

And as for me 
And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go I am going like Elsie

From cradle to doom

It's only a cabaret, old chum!
And I love a cabaret!",Cabaret,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride

They're the luckiest people in the world

And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, ""this is love, this is it!""
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that spring is a bore!

Love seemed sure around the new year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear? 
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Spring is here, there?s no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won?t hear it breaking,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

College boys are writing sonnets,
In the ""tender passion"" they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Love came my way, I hope it would last,
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of son,
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!

Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
""sulfur and molasses"" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

All alone, the party's over,
Old man winter was a gracious host,
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most!",Spring Can Really Hang You Upthe Most,1994
Ella Fitzgerald,"A-tisket, a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way I dropped it

I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
She took my yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I would die

A-tisket, a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

Oh dear, I wonder where my basket can be
Oh gee, I wish that little girl I could see
Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine

A-tisket, a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
Won't someone help me find my basket
And make me happy again

Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air

Ella Fitzgerald,"I went down to the dance
Such a clown by the wall
Invited to dance
By no one at all

The couples danced fine
So charming and gay
But nobody wants
To look over my way

So awfully sad
Dissatisfied
I hurt so bad
I almost cried
Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

Head high, standing tall
Who else, who else could I be?

A fella who likes what they see?

And then in my ear
Someone said to me
Wallflower, my dear
How come you can't see
They couldn't care less?
They're not impressed
As you might have guessed
You're in excess

Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

I smiled to the crowd
Tip toe and alert
Yes, the band blues went loud
But next on a flirt

A voice said to me

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
comes round the age of gold
when peace shall over all the earth

which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1995

The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me

Far from history I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

When he said, the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wantin' you
Said, I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune, yes

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how
But ho, ho, ho

Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie

They laughed at me wanting you
Said, it would be, hello, goodbye
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

Ella Fitzgerald,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A  Fine Romance (with Louis Armstrong),1996

Ella Fitzgerald,"He would spend it on the ponies
He would spend it on the girls
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old hennaed curls
And when his wife said, ""Hey now
What did you get for me?""
He socked her in the chopper
Such a sweet, sweet guy was he

[Chorus]
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind

How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers

[Chorus]

He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more

That showed her figure fine
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy
No insurance could she find

When I could be out where the lights are bright?

Why am I wasting these precious years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him.

Sometimes when I get feeling low,
I say ""Let's call it quits.""
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart in bits.
Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me,
But even if he does you can believe me,
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim.",Jim,1997

His advances she frequently spurns
In her anger one day
She may send him away
Then she's anxious until he returns
Until he returns
She provokes him as much as she can
But she likes him to still persevere
Oh, it's very remiss
And the danger is this
She may do it too often, I fear

Doubtless his heart will soften
But the day may arrive
When she finds out, alack

Then that maiden will sit there and sigh
For the lesson is bitter indeed
Now she's quite wide awake
She can see her mistake
And for pardon she's longing to plead
She's longing to plead
She has let all her chances pass by
And the moral may clearly be seen
For whoever you are
It is better by far
If you always will say what you mean
If you always will say what you mean

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.
That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.",Memphis Blues,1997

Will keep us together

To be caught in the rain
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

They broke and oh
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Tho' we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Baby, long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain
You were going on your way

Caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze, tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

Erased the trees, tenderly

Embraced the breeze, tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, (ring-a-ling) hear them ring (ting-a-ling)
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks

Children laughing, people passing

And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap

She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man

Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah

Ella Fitzgerald,"Thanks for the memory
Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wondrous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London, but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup, I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But thanks for the memory
Of every touch and thrill; I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot; you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight, the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching too

I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry; baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
And thank you so much",Thanks for the Memory,1998

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

But as long as you love me so

Ella Fitzgerald,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Heart's full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Heart's full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Goes by
As time goes by

I think about a night
When the earth smelled of Summer
And the sky was streaked with white

There are new lovers now

I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
minor,

To some romantic shore

The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

Seems to turn into love songs

And life will always be

Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

""You can't take those guitars on board""

Ella Fitzgerald,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little moon starts to climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
A lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain",Star Dust,2001

The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway.

The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.

Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather

Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailing, sailing
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We find each others arms in troubled waters
We found that's the safest place to go
From now we can laugh at troubled waters

Who's that comin' down the thoroughfare
The sunshine flashin' on his ring
Bowin' left and right and here and there

Cigarettes from the Nile
He tallks like a 'eyebrow', but he plays Chicago style

He gets his shoes made in London
And they're real crocodile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style

And he sometimes plays sweet
Hup-toodle-oodle-oodle-dee-ooo
But sweet or hot, he's always got
That real gut-bucket beat

He's got a neat Latin moustache
And the girls love his smile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style
A trombone made in Newark
Played in Chicago style

Chicago style
Chicago style

He gets his neckties from Naples
And his socks from Argyle
Speaks Oxford English, but he plays Chicago style

Wears a stickpin from Rio, are you listenin'
You can see it for a mile
But he plays trombone...Chicago style

And he sometimes plays sweet
Uncle Jake's weary blues
But sweet or hot, he's always got
That real gut-bucket beat

And gets two on the aisle
But he plays trombone...Chicago style

She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that's flying homeward
It's that Airmail Special on the fly

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California

Hear her moan and cough and sigh

But I'm in love and I know what time it is
The good book says, ""Go seek and ye shall find""
Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!

My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers

An emotion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man
Like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good

So bad, so bad

I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you
Lord above me make him love me the way he should

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
The things I tell my pillow
No woman should

Ella Fitzgerald,"Well, you know Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen
(Comet, and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen)
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Is it Herman? (no)
Is it Shermon? (no)
Is it Eddy, is it Freddy? (no, no no!)
It is Heart, is it Shaptler, is it Mosteres?
(Oh, you'll never, never guess it, don't snap your cap)
Talkin' 'bout Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Oh, him
Had a very shiny nose
So I heard they say if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
Like a hot rasie

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
(Rudolph is a red nose)
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph, I say Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer's loved him
And they shouted out with glee
(Rudolph, Rudolph, Rudolph)
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!

(Well, the stake glows bosset
His snarl snoot
His tuba that glow like a light-ta-root)
With his pink kazoo, he guided the sleigh
(He's a hero) 
Why, Rudolph saved the day

Rudolph has got his red nose
In the reign deer hall of fame
Rudolph the red nosed favorite
Of the little reign deer days
Rudolph the North Pole big shot
Rides around in Santa's sleigh
Wearin' a green Fedora
Smoking a cigar all day

(This story has a moral
Anyone can plainly see)
Just keep your red nose a gleemin'
You'll go down in history

(If you keep you nose a red, red rose)
If you keep your beak all pink and sleek
And if you keep your snooze maroon because
You'll go down in history","Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer [John Beltran Remix]",2005

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven

I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love

Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love

I thought that cards were a frame-up
I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high

Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
Taking a chance on love

Here I slip again
About to take that tip again
Got my grip again
Taking a chance on love

Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
In the grove again
Taking a chance on love

I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And, brother rabbit, of course you
Better kiss your foot goodbye

On the ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again

Ella Fitzgerald,"That old black magic has me in it's spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up
And down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel
Inside
When that elevator starts it's ride
Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go,
All around I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love

Dangerous rhythm

It's something daring, the Continental

An invitation to moonlight and romance
It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance

You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, oh, it's continental

Your voice is gentle and so sentimental

You'll know before the dance is through

It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me

I have words that do not come from children's books

And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist.

And everything I've got belongs to you.

You get struck each time I strike.
You for me, me for me

I'm not yours for better but for worse,
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse.
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,
And everything I've got belongs to you.

Don't raise your voice at me,
That's very rude.
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude.
It's wrong essentially when woman yells,
And confidentially, it smells.

I'll converse with you on politics at length,
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength.
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!""
And everything I've got belongs to you.

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride

Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame

Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear

It gives your feet a feeling so breezy
And, oh, it's so easy to get

They call it wacky dust
It brings a dancing jag
And once it starts, then only a
Sap'll refuse to Big Apple or Shag

Oh, I don't know just why
It gets you so high
Putting a buzz in you heart
You'll do a marathon
You'll wanna go on
Kickin' the ceilin' apart

They call it wacky dust
It's something you can't trust
And in the end the rhythm will stop
When it does, then you'll drop
From happy wacky dust",Wacky Dust [Single Version],2008

Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges, they say, do it
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

'How high the moon'
Is the name of the song
How high the moon

Though the words may be wrong
We're singing it because you ask for it
So we're singing it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars
How high the moon
Does it reach out to Mars

A green and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way I dropped it

I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it

And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
She took my yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I would die

A-tisket, a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

Oh dear, I wonder where my basket can be
Oh gee, I wish that little girl I could see
Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine

A-tisket, a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
Won't someone help me find my basket

That would bore me terrifically too

Ella Fitzgerald,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear [DVD],2009

While there out making more; what for?

She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her love down

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh, will you never let me be?
Oh, will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain
A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings, but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
First daffodils
And long excited cables
And candle lights
On little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening
When the bell has sounded
The Isle de France
With all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange, how sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains
At empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside
Dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
Gardenia perfume
Lingering on a pillow
Wild strawberries
Only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
The smile of Garbo
And the scent of roses
The waiters whistling
As the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange, how sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smoldering leaves
The wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street
Who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you",These Foolish Things [Live],2009
Ella Fitzgerald,"I used to be the apple of your eye
I had you with me every day
But now whenever you are passing by
You're always looking the other way
It's little things like this
That prompt me to say

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five- and ten-cent store

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long for the day when I'll cling to him

But a fool can have his charms

The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand

Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas

Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah

Start pouring water on a drowning man

Ella Fitzgerald,"It had to be you
It had to be you
I've wandered around
Finally found
Somebody who
Could make me be true
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinkin' of you

Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you

Gave me a thrill

I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love

Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love

I thought that cards were a frame-up
I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high

Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
Taking a chance on love

Here I slip again
About to take that tip again
Got my grip again
Taking a chance on love

Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
In the grove again
Taking a chance on love

I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And, brother rabbit, of course you
Better kiss your foot goodbye

On the ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again
Taking a chance on love",Taking a Chance on Love [Mono Version][*],2009

Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Ella Fitzgerald,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows 
Anything goes.",Anything Goes [Live at the Crescendo],2010

With no bromo-seltzer handy

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think

Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him

Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot

Listen to my tale of woe, it's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue.
I must win some winsome miss

Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
Which somebody just like you. so...

Oh sweet and lovely,
Lady be good,
Oh lady be good to me.
I am so awfully misunderstood,
So lady be good, to me.
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city.
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good... to me.

Auburn and brunette and blonde:
I love 'em all, tall or small
But somehow they don't' grow fond;
They stagger but never fall.
Winte'rs gone, and now it's spring!
Love! where is thy sting?
If somebody won't respond,
I'm going to end it all.
So...

Oh sweet and lovely lady, be good.
Oh lady, be good to me!
I am so awfully misunderstood,
So, lady be good to me.
This is tulip weather -
So let's put two and two together.
I tell you
I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So, lady be good, to me.","Oh Lady, Be Good!",2012

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore, an orchestra`s playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever

When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today

Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons

I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear

Ella Fitzgerald,"Well, you know Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen
(Comet, and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen)
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Is it Herman? (no)
Is it Shermon? (no)
Is it Eddy, is it Freddy? (no, no no!)
It is Heart, is it Shaptler, is it Mosteres?
(Oh, you'll never, never guess it, don't snap your cap)
Talkin' 'bout Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Oh, him
Had a very shiny nose
So I heard they say if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
Like a hot rasie

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
(Rudolph is a red nose)
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph, I say Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer's loved him
And they shouted out with glee
(Rudolph, Rudolph, Rudolph)
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!

(Well, the stake glows bosset
His snarl snoot
His tuba that glow like a light-ta-root)
With his pink kazoo, he guided the sleigh
(He's a hero) 
Why, Rudolph saved the day

Rudolph has got his red nose
In the reign deer hall of fame
Rudolph the red nosed favorite
Of the little reign deer days
Rudolph the North Pole big shot
Rides around in Santa's sleigh
Wearin' a green Fedora
Smoking a cigar all day

(This story has a moral
Anyone can plainly see)
Just keep your red nose a gleemin'
You'll go down in history

And if you keep your snooze maroon because
You'll go down in history",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer [Remastered],2015
Ella Fitzgerald,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

A home where love waits, I know.

I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

Ella Fitzgerald & Her Fellas,"A kiss goodnight is alright
But remember this
That a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
A kiss goodnight with a hug real tight
Is nothing short of bliss
And a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
It's an old custom for a boy and girl to embrace
In some secluded place
LIttle mister cupid never could be quite so stupid
As to do a turn about face
So it just ain't right to kiss goodnight
And stop at 3 or 4
'Cause a kiss goodnight leads to a dozen or more

Don't stand there at the door knock knock

But, baby, it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, Sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Oh, baby don't hold out, baby
Ahh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside

How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay

When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?

Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street
