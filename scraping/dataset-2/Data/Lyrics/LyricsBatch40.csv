Charlie Simpson,"I don't give a damn about you
No nothing can change my mind
No way
I'm happy just to let you walk away
Don't think about you at night
I'm happy to be alone
It's okay
But that was yesterday and now I'm

Drivin' in my car
Words don't get me far
When they don't mean shh (arghhh)

Calling you at three am
And I'm standing here right outside your door
And I don't think that my heart could take much more
Scared of breaking up again
And I just want it to be like it was before
Cause I don't think that my heart could take much more

I don't give a damn what you do
I'm going to get with you
Again 
And that's the way this night is gonna end
You say that you need some time
How long does it take to see
That we are more than meant to be

And now you're drivin' in you're car
But you won't get far
Cause you're car is shhh (arghh)

Calling you at 3am
And I'm standing here right outside your door
And I don't think that my heart could take much more
Scared of breaking up again
And I just want it to be like it was before
Cause I don't think that my heart could take much more

Can't take much more [Repeat x4]

Drivin' in my car
Words don't get me far
When they don't mean shhh (arghh) 

Calling you at three am

And I don't think that my heart could take much more
Scared of breaking up again

Cause I don't think that my heart could take much more",3am,2004
Charlie Simpson,"The more I look
The more I find it hard to see
I'm uncultured
But I'm not quite sure what that means
Why bring me down
And complicate
You take my words 
But then you hear them a different way
When we're talking 
But I'm not quite sure what to say
We're talking now but is it too late
Who's listening now 
Why won't you

Find me 
And show me
What do you want from
There's gotta be better than this
I don't want to leave you
But maybe I need to
There's gotta be better than this
But we'll never know

Do you remember when we talked 
For hours on end
Just being stupid
But at least we didn't pretend
Your smile helped me
To find my way
Who's listenin' now 
Why won't you

Find me 
And show me
What do you want from
There's gotta be better than this
I don't want to leave you
But maybe I need to
There's gotta be better than this
But we'll never know

I'll dream this away
And come back another day
When I'm less afraid
Of it all

Find me 
And show me
What do you want from
There's gotta be better than this
I don't want to leave you
But maybe I need to
There's gotta be better than this
But we'll never know x 3",Better Than This,2004
Charlie Simpson,"I can't believe
What my girlfriend did today
She screamed
So loudly
Then she turned away
Why did she cut me down to size
She left me wondering
Can I do it right

What am I gonna do now the games up 
Can't get her off that's kinda rough
She better not tell my mates today
So baby tell me now
Do I need to measure
Cause I'm feeling under pressure
I'm just hoping that the fear will go away
Don't want to be a fake

I woke up in a sweat
Felt a disgrace
She looked so beautiful
Love on her face
Feeling stupid all on my own
I put it down to experience
Cause now I've grown

What am I gonna do now the games up
Can't get her off that's kinda rough
She better not tell my mates today
So baby tell me now
Do I need to measure
Cause I'm feeling under pressure
I'm just hoping that the fear will go away
Don't want to be a fake

Don't want to be a fake
It's quite uncanny
Cause my favorite film is when Harry met Sally
Now we're finished
there's no way
We're ever gonna be okay
Don't want to be a fake
How low can I go
You might find me reading Cosmo
But when I've finished
You know you're gonna want to be with me
You know you're gonna want to be with me
You know you're gonna want to be with me

Got a girl on my sofa yeah
Getting undressed 
I gotta know can I deliver
Cause I'm feeling stressed

What am I gonna do now is my game up
I've got the goods
Is that enough
there's almost nothing left to say
So wish me luck not gonna run
The final countdown has begun
Not gonna see or hear you laughing in my face

What can I do now the games up 
Can't get her off that's kinda rough
She better not tell my mates today
So baby tell me now
Do I need to measure
Cause I'm feeling under pressure
I'm just hoping that the fear will go away

Don't want to be a fake",Fake,2004
Charlie Simpson,"It was an amazing end
To the perfect day
Sun sinking low in the sky
We sat and watched all the dolphins
Swim in the bay
That crazy look in your eye

We ran in slow motion
Over the sand
Into the ocean
Holding your hand
But then it gets hazy 
And I lose you and then that's when

I wake up scared to phone her
And realize I'm a loner in love
Yeah-eh-yeah
It's still the same old story
Tears of mornin' glory
No luck
That's the reason why my life sucks
Very much 
Being a loner in love

The next day I ran into your current boyfriend
Told him what we did last night
Before my story had even got to the end
He challenged me to a fight

I ran in slow motion away from him
But he caught up to me
Kicked my teeth in
Now I got no chance 'cause I can't even grin
No nothing's changing

I wake up scared to phone her
And realize I'm a loner in love

Charlie Simpson,"At first I told myself
I need my head inspected
I noticed little things
Same t shirt and sunglasses
Then it got weirder see
She cut her hair like me
She bought a red guitar
Kept drivin' round in my car

I'm kissing her and she
She slams me against the wall
She crashed into a bus
Chasin' some model
She's analyzed my smile
She's memorized my phone book
She always wears my clothes
Her favorite words are fuck off

She looks like 
Talks like 
Sounds like me
She's stealin' my identity

And I'm begging you
Somebody notice me
Somebody notice
I'm fading away here
What I gotta do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be me

I'm saying somethings wrong
She out back playing soccer
She used to do ballet
Now she's a heavy smoker
She's so obsessed with me
Now she stands up to pee
And now her stupid games
Have started taking over

Don't need no special help
Don't need to see a doctor
I know you're worried but
I'm telling you just watch her
Its like she's cracked my code
Things I've never spoke of 
She wants sex all the time
And still finds time to fuck off

She looks like 
Talks like 
Sounds like me
She's stealin' my identity

She won't stop provoking me
I'm goin' under
What I gotta do to make you see
My girlfriend is a wannabe
And she wants to be me

I'm in the loony bin
Wearing a pale pink nightie
The nurse comes through the door
And whispers so politely
Your boyfriends here to see you
Look pretty take a bath
I love his silly band
Can I get his autograph

She looks like 
Talks like 
Sounds like me

Charlie Simpson,"Some of us will live our lives
Like we are just living life on the run
Some of us will die in our old age
Others of us will die young

But sometimes it feels like I am just
Getting so many things wrong
It feels like I'm walking down my last mile
And my God, it just feels so long

Please just slow it down
I'm walking off these years
Please just slow it down
'Cause I can't stand the tears

Charlie Simpson,"Welcome to my cemetery gates
I lost your love and I buried it here
'Cause you're the one who stole my heart
Down the river

I don't need you to tell me that I'm alright
There's something in the air
There's something in the water
Dragging me down

I just hope your mind stays stable
When you're Cain and unable
To speak to me again

We never made it to the start of the race
I guess I thought that in the end we would be saved
There's someone up in the sky looking down over me

Well, call me selfish, call me what you will
I don't care about you anymore
You fucked me up and broke my heart
In smithereens

I don't need you to tell me that I'm alright

Charlie Simpson,"Spoken like a young man trying to get himself on the wheel 
My feet are forwards but I think I'm going backwards I'm still 
So far away from you 
I called my brothers on the phone just to say goodbye 
'Cause I don't need another reason not to survive on my own 
I'm moving on from here 

Then I realize that I'll be on my own tonight
Shadows fold out like blankets on the ground 

Run run rabbit run 
Just don't get caught out by the farmer and his gun 
Well hide hide rabbit hide 
It's best to lose yourself before you ever lose your pride 

Spoken like a true man trying to make his way through the fields
My back is heavy and my heart is feeling empty but still 
I'm so far away from you 
There's no use complaining to myself 
I made these shoes to walk in 
And they'll walk until the end 

And then I realize that I will dream of you tonight

Are we just like them? Are we just like them?
I've pushed, pushed you so far
It's the only way I know how
Maybe you, maybe you should know

That I've lost you, I've lost you
That I've lost you now, I've lost you

Can you hear the choir sing?
We never made it to the old town, my God
We never made it very far away from here

Days go by without words
Is it 'cause you don't want me around?

Charlie Singleton,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2002

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2002

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1969

Charlie Waller,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""
""Lord!"" she said"" ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""",Casey's Last Ride,1983
Charlie Waller,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

In a distant land so many miles away.

I'd see Lincoln, Custer, Washington and Perry,
And Nathan Hale and Colin Kelly, too.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
Waving o'er the land of heroes brave and true.

In this war with its mad schemes of destruction
Of our country fair and our sweet liberty,
By the mad dictators, leaders of corruption,
Can't the U. S. use a mountain boy like me?
God gave me the right to be a free American,
And for that precious right I'd gladly die.
There's a Star-Spangled Banner waving somewhere,
That is where I want to live when I die.
 
Though I realize I'm crippled, that is true, sir,
Please don't judge my courage by my twisted leg.
Let me show my Uncle Sam what I can do, sir,
Let me help to bring the Axis down a peg.
If I do some great deed I will be a hero,
And a hero brave is what I want to be.

In that heaven there should be a place for me.

Charlie Waller & the Country Gentlemen,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old grey men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

CHORUS:
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.

CHORUS

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Charlie Waller & the Country Gentlemen,"One morning, one morning, one morning in May,
I spied a young couple; they were making their way
And one was a lady so bright and so fair,
And the other was a soldier, and a brave volunteer 

Good morning, good morning, good morning, said he,
And where are you going my pretty lady,
I'm going out a walking by the banks of the sea,
Just to see the waters roll and hear the nightingale sing.

Now they had not been standing but a minute or so
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune that he played made the valleys to ring
Oh hark, cried the maiden, hear the nightingales sing 

Oh maiden, fair maiden, 'tis time to give o'er
Oh no, kind soldier, please play one tune more
For I'd rather hear your fiddle with the touch of one string
Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingales sing 

Oh soldier, kind soldier, will you marry me?
Oh no, pretty maiden, that never shall be
I've a wife down in London and children twice three
Two wives and the army's too many for me 

Well I'll go back to London and I'll stay there for a year
It's often that I'll think of you my little dear
And if ever I return it'll be in the spring
To see the waters glide and hear the nightingales sing 

Come dry up your tears, there is nothing to fear
I will roam these green valleys now for many's a long year
When the birds sang so sweet, this young man proved his deceit
Saying adieu, lovely fair maid, we will never more meet 

With my snuff box and cane, this whole world I will range
Like Venus or Diana in search of her swain
When the moon shines so clear, I will mourn for my dear
Over mountains, clear fountains, where no one can hear 

There's one thing that I know, and that before I go
I will never return for to hear her sad woe
There's another thing I know and that before I go
That the ranger and the stranger have many's the foe. ",One Morning in May,2002

Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1992
Charlie Watts,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",1993
Charlie Watts,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1993
Charlie Watts,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1993
Charlie Watts,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1993
Charlie Watts,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1993
Charlie Watts,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone

She was just a groupie

[Daz & Kurupt]
Bitch! (Bitch!)
I come through with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch
The riviera ever skaty, my team ya's the shit
Fifteen's humping, dropped the top, she moaned
counting my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss
In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side
We high, blazing like crazy, we don't know why
feeling good as fuck on a hot ass day
and it's a pujam right around the way
Niggas got hos but ladies in the world
they want to play wit their minds like little girls
I twirled my fingers in the air
rubbed my fingers through my hair
Red bones to black bones
dark bows to red bows
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
but I play hos like plenty-leany cause I get greedy
It's all about game 'cause when the game
is hard to maintain for so long, man
From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma
Tonight ""warning the award is"" from Mississippi, I know ya
hold the key to unlock the door
From long clothes she rolls with gold things we riding for sure
So tell me how much money can one player make? (make)
and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (you know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)

I was off in Vallejo
pulling hos like Idaho potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
being from where I be, DPG
It's manifico
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico
mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
and let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone the place that I call home
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room
Picture me ay
entrepreneur with my nigga D-A
Rockin tours and we still young boys
They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas
She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
That's right
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G
Hey girl, what's your name? Ya want to go a couple rounds with me
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy

[Warren G & Snoop Dogg]
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound
'cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you
Gimme a chance and I'ma break you
down to the very last compound
with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos
I bust a brand new ho in every video
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow
I pass a ho to my kinfolk
and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi
then turn on some Snoopy and, heat up jacuzzi
and later on I might just turn on a movie
so you can re-groupie and redo me just for Snoopy

Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread
Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskating
On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG popping all that junk
About ""I'll fuck you up"", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day demonstration beat conversation

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been working on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuck against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

Killing up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em sliding in their eel-skins, grooving in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop being a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoos that's how they got you

Look, I represent the LBC-ment

I hit you with a tune every blue moon

And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'

Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But it's steel, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

[Kurupt]
Hey yo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket
And make a loot, niggas want trip
Spitting like ""you spoke beef from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit""
Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say
""it's the wagy to get paid"", DP's and pay
I don't know why you want to get on my back? (why?)
Tripping 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you should of roll
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue

Niggas from Seth be trying to set you 'cause you setting your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

Just what we need, banging on wax another trip
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mother-ship?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
Cause, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missing
Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossing
But guess what it cost em, they crossing me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

[Chorus: Repeats]",Up Jump Tha Boogie,1996
Charlie Wilson,"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big Turkish wole with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flaunting and won't it speaking
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb with the beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down wit his starks untied
And a blue and gray cap that said the east-side
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nothing but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass transform wit finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at the V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offering him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussing

the vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
after getting rejected, I ain't running upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?'  Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-see straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listening to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
""We used to see Daz, back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

An every time I wanna dig you out
You tell me ""don't rush""
Money stashing, you got me sneaking
An we all alone in the zone, I be tweaking

I had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend
It's written on my face, an I can't even hide it
So I decided, to ride it
Roses are red, an Violets are blue
Girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do what ya do when ya do
An now ya want a Benz for ya birthday
An I been waiting to hit that ass since the first day
I'm buying you gifts, drape'in you out, with gold

Said ""lady could you pray for me?""

Because my life is my wife, an that ain't right
Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, an what I was choose to do
Whether it's buying a house, or car, or some clothes for you
I try to stay true to it, see I ain't new to it

See I'm attracted, an I'm infatuated

But to fine time to leave all that behind
An trying to spend some time an give you all of mine 
{what's that} ya see
I ain't hard to get along with, 
To do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh
Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
An, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
Just keep it on the real wit me
Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner

After the fronting and fighting, 
That's where the love making begins real good baby
But our friends ain't our friends
Your mama in our business, 'n' your sister in our business
The media in our business
These motherfuckers don't understand

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson:]
You said you're a friend of mine, it turned out you crossed the line
I forgive you I don't know why, you said you're a friend of mine
You said you're a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said you're a friend of mine

[Master P:]
Call the cops for nothing, all the jumping and stunting
It should be kissing and hugging, I mean loving and rubbing
I'm on your team, you're on my team, I'm your king, you my queen
I'm the ice, you the cream, but your friends love the scheme
Even I told you you was special, see these hoes will sweat you
The niggas will wet you, but the ghetto is pressure
No more fighting in front of the kids, it's time to live big
Build a family tree of figs, and let the haters dig
You my rose I'm your flower, I think about you ever hour
Keep them hoes out our business, if you need me just holla

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg:]
I tell you all my problems, share my deepest secrets with ya
Hit ya on the side, girl you down to ride
I feel so safe with ya, get cha what you need
A condo in the valley with the keys, palm trees, jet skies
Fly you over seas, it's silly how we did it
Really we committed
I'm dippin' out the studio with the too faking 
My heart just uh aching, while I'm shaking and snaking
You tell me take a chance, so I dance with the devil
I kiss you on the cheek, and now we sneak into the bedroom
Tossing and turning, burning, yearning for love
And you supposed to be in love with my young 'cause
What's love got to do with this? And it's all based on friendship
Ain't that twisted, somebody told my boo and I think it was you
Had to be, 'cause I ain't heard from you or seen you, so it must be true

[Chorus x 2]",Suppose to Be My Friend,1999
Charlie Wilson,"Stokley sings
Can I get to know you

Won't you let me complete you baby

My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di

Beautiful, perfect, flawless, debonair

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Where'd you get that silky skin?
And the colors those eyes come in?
Does the light come from within?
God made you, did he make the grin?
Wings are under all your clothes
You worth more than your weight in gold
Where did God put down your mole
Or were you only made for show?
Girl you're perfect, when God made you
I wonder if he kept the mold, or are you just for show?
Girl you're perfect, when I see you
It takes my mind to cloud nine, girl you're so fine, yeah - hey

[Snoop Dogg]
Lovable, and yeah you're pursuable
Everything is beautiful, even down to your cuticles
It ain't about me, it's all about you
You make me do what you want me to
Yeah, it's just like that
Here go my number baby girl why don't you get right back
You're a, perfect dime, I'm working mine
Just the thought of me and you I mean it's blowing my mind
Can't explain it doe, but if I'm with you
I can't remain a ho, or stay in the flow
It's a shame to know, I maintain the flow
Baby girl me and you is unexplainable
Mm, yeah, we need to get into acting
Can't you see this is a natural attraction
A lot of maxing and relaxing
See'mon baby girl, give a player some action, I'm asking

If you would, if I could
You make the bad boy in me go good
Tell a lie? No I tell the truth
Baby boo on the real you know you hundred proof
Mm, I can't even believe that
You living the single life, damn I need that
I hate to see a queen without a king
If I had you I'd get you everything
Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
See my baby go wherever I go
Costa Rica, Obregato
If I get you I hit the lotto
Loco shopping, get what you want to
Sky's the limit, so go on and spend it
I said it cause I meant it
So go and give me your love and get in it to win it
Hit it

[Snoop Dogg]
Mm, I know you dig my rapping
I see you smiling so I might get some action
Yeah, so let's get it cracking
It won't be no +Rerun+, ""Hey, hey, hey, what's happenin'?""
It won't be no type of scrapping
Me and you, this is everlasting
I hate to sound sarcastic
But we'll make a classic, it'll be fantastic
We need to get into acting

How my passion fills just knowing that you're on your way home again

[Chorus]
We've been through it all
A lot of things girl,
You make my heart just skip a beat in so many ways
Only you I call until this day girl
You make my heart just skip a beat let me count the ways

Nothing's perfect we still have our days
But that doesn't mean our love will stray
If anything it takes me right back to you
Wishes answered from the very start
Before hello you have left your mark
One so deep I could not remove even if I wanted to

[Bridge]
From your warm embrace to how your kisses taste
The way you look at me, with such sincerity
I feel like every man should feel
I pinch myself to see if it's real

The letters you wrote, even the simple notes
Just you took your time to say what's on your mind
I really couldn't ask for more
Oh yea",Thru It All,2005
Charlie Wilson,"What if you thought too much and missed out on your blessings girl?
What if you had your chance and you let it pass?
What if you lived your whole life and your heart never knew what it felt like to be loved, loved?
Could you deal with it? Could you live with yourself if you made a decision that was all wrong?
And I was long gone? And what if you were blind and couldn't see that it was me?

[Chorus]
What if I'm the one to wife you like you're supposed to be?
What if I'm the one to cop you that ten carat ring?
What if it's me that's supposed to be with you baby?
Forever would be better if I was just with you

What if I'm the one you should be making babies with?
I know you're the one cause I don't mind you spending all my chips
What if it's me that's supposed to be with you baby?
Forever would be better
I'm the one for you

Just think what if you had someone who unconditionally loved you girl
And you slipped on him and let him pass
What if God gave you what you prayed for but you didn't receive it
Cause you didn't believe it
What if you never had no one to make love with all in the kitchen

And you missed him
What if had the house, and a car, and the kids, and the dog?
What if everything you wanted, you could have it all

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And baby right now is the time for you to make up your mind
Cause tomorrow's not promised to nobody
And baby I'm convinced, it's no coincidence
Girl let me be the one to make your name Mrs. Wilson
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Girl let me be the one to break you off and get your head sprung
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Girl let me be the one to lay you down and get you naked
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Baby girl don't make me wait no more I just can't take it

[Chorus: Repeats]",What If I'm the One,2005

Now I play her far like a move player star
She still sweatin' me hard because I'm a rap star
I be cruisn up the block I be passin her 
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call to hang, is when me 
And deep blood is up scheming on the gang bang
She shoulda used her intuition 
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position
Listen she sayin' I dissed her cause I'm fuckin' her sister
A message to the fellers that gets some piss uh
But she started that fuckin' family
She fucked ma man D so why she mad at me?
Fuckin sister look better than you, 
Give head better than you, pussy, gets wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

Nah I'm sayin'? But now it's our time to shine down here nigga!
Nah I'm sayin'? So since y'all niggas keep sayin we ain't real hip-hop down here
We don't wanna be down with you bitch ass niggas!

When I some real trill shit to go left to
Gotta lot of respect fool (yeah), for the ones before me

I've been down with rap music since Cold Crush and Melle (Melle)
Before MTV put Run-D.M.C. on the tele (tele)
Back when Whodini tried to tell ya about ya friends
Nigga I was giving rap all my time and my ends
Bought damn near every record the motherfucker dropped
West coast gangsta music, East coast hip-hop
Now it's our time to shine and the tables is turned
Them motherfuckers aggravated 'cause we gettin' some burn
""There's no room for everybody, just a few niggas is swole"" (why is that?)
Probably 'cause they favorite rappers ain't in control
But just let go of the past 'cause it's hurtin' your hands
And pass it over to the next generation of fans
And quit hatin' the South

Ain't nobody typing that much, can't be a danger
Catch you in person, bitch I'll break yo' fingers!

From the East to the West, some of y'all garbage too
As long as the beat knock and the lyrics hot, son
I can give a rat's ass where a rapper is from
I remember N.W.A. and P-E

Charlie Wilson,"[Chorus]
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammy's
But these streets won't say a goodbye

I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)

I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I can't say goodbye goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies

[Verse 1]
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,
Let them do them take care of your own boy""
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me, 
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot, man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live... In the streets

Time is not on my side. 
I've learned to love and with you I cry.
Give anything to be with you somehow.
Settle down maybe for your love.

I've lost you once yeah and I vow that I would never lose you again.
And I would never give up again.

Girl you got me shook, after all of the fighting and the screaming
Snatched up the keys then you got in the range knowing that its raining
(why'd I let you go) I don't know how long it took but I know that I drove all around,
Trying to calm you down wouldn't answer my calls, now I'm scared girl where'd you go

Damn girl why'd you leave like that? whatever I said didn't mean it like that,
How you expect for me not to fight back when you scream like that, girl I love you more than that.
The other night at the club when I hit off a blunt. I love you more that.
When I smile at a butt cause your all that I want.

I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl, what do I do.
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya.
And girl it breaks my heart if I broke your heart what do I do?

If I could just love you tonight, I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl what do I do
I can't live with ya, I can't live without ya girl

Wish I could tell you how I feel, everything that I'm working for is yours
How could I ignore when I wanna be yours girl I slam the door (right on our love)

When I pulled up at the mall
Couldn't find a place to park
Threw my keys to the valet
(handle that for me)
I was only there to hang
Wasn't looking for a thing
I was just about to bounce
And then I saw miss lady
Then I said to myself,

There goes my baby
There goes my destiny
Onliest one for me
There goes my lady
She gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love
We gon' have some babies

She was coming out the shoe store
Pretty little thing
A couple of bags in her hand,
Right in front of Macy's
And then I saw her at the food court,
Sipping lemonade,and conversating
On her cell phone,looking so amazing
And I said to myself

There goes my baby
There goes my destiny
Onliest one for me
There goes my lady
She gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love
We gon' have some babies

She gon' wear my ring
She gon' take my name
Take her to the cookout
Me and her gon' hang
Take her to my mama house
Meet smokey and them
If she need her hair done
I think my cousin can
I'll treat her like a queen
Give her everything
She will be my girl
Till we old and gray,

That I saw her lovely, lovely face",There Goes My Baby,2008

Even though for right now you're so far away
I hope and I pray
Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay

So when you gonna call me? When you gonna come through?
All I wanna do is download, when you gonna let me download?
Shawty up, shawty down low, when you gonna let me download?

I'm on Myspace and it's type late
My baby got me number one on his top eight
It's computer love, we don't mind to hate
They just MySpace freaks tryna find a date

We up all night havin' cybersex
He chat, I chat though we never met
He said he wanna explore me like the Internet
It's like an orgasm every time he sent a text

He wanna download, he likes to download
Little Kim songs and put 'em on his ringtone
He even got my screen saver on his iPhone
I get more hits than a T inzone

We goin' back and forth, sendin' emails
He a thug so I hit 'em on his Gmail
His sense of humor got me writin' LOL
I sent pictures of myself straight to the cell

Shawty, I been lookin' at these pictures of you cyber surfin'
So when you gonna call me? When you gonna come through?
All I wanna do is download, when you gonna let me download?
Shawty up, shawty down low, when you gonna let me download?

He been lookin' at my sexy pics, said he diggin' my sexy hips
He wanna kiss my sexy lips and download me on his floppy disk
Little Kim is the only one on his mind
He wanna come through and put me on his hard drive

Three o'clock in the morning we be online
Others send friend requests but they get denied
He type I miss you
I type back to let him know the feeling's mutual

It's just Myspace love but it's beautiful
He love to watch my videos on YouTube
Hey, it's like everytime I log on I get so turned on
Computer love playin' in the back

Charlie Wilson,"I never thought the sun would shine my way
All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream, cause a dream's unstoppable

I could've gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close

Storms and Rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up cause I know

Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream,
cause a dream's unstoppable

Dream
That you can fly,
Dream
That you can climb
Dream
A mountain, all you gotta do is just
Dream
That you can win,
Dream
With Confidence
Dream
To the very end cause dreamers become champions
Dream
Until it's real,
Dream,
Don't let them kill your
Dream
The fight still is in you, all you gotta do is
Dream,
Just keep the faith,
Dream,
Don't ever break
Don't let it slip away cause all you gotta do

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
Dream, then you can do anything
Dream, you're halfway to destiny
Dream, dream's unstoppable

And thought that you would understand it
But through it all we managed to make it through tough times

I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)
We met through mutual friends
And this is where the story and confusion begin
Cause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

A six year difference is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more

And when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb
You should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention ""hang,"" I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck your shit
It's that kitchen fan
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck

I really like you

Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
(Just say the word)
See the answers are all there
(But I'm just too gone to see)
You and I are cut from different fiber
(I wonder why, I wonder why, girl)
Don't be too material to see
(But I'm just too gone to see)
This world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

But you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
Fuck
Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
Cause you're too fuckin' young

Charlie Wilson,"[Snoop Dogg]
Josey Wales was known for robbing trains and things
Laying everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gang-bang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slipping through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searching for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shooting range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at the Wild Horny Corral
I heard of ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me want to bust
Back to the drawing down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[LBC Crew]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I got's lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stopping young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my knapsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Trying ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't making no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Charlie Wilson,"I was rolling in my car
When I pulled up at the mall
Couldn't find a place to park
Threw my keys to the valet
(handle that for me)
I was only there to hang
Wasn't looking for a thing
I was just about to bounce
And then I saw miss lady
Then I said to myself,

There goes my baby
There goes my destiny
Onliest one for me
There goes my lady
She gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love
We gon' have some babies

She was coming out the shoe store
Pretty little thing
A couple of bags in her hand,
Right in front of Macy's
And then I saw her at the food court,
Sipping lemonade,and conversating
On her cell phone,looking so amazing
And I said to myself

There goes my baby
There goes my destiny
Onliest one for me
There goes my lady
She gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love
We gon' have some babies

She gon' wear my ring
She gon' take my name
Take her to the cookout
Me and her gon' hang
Take her to my mama house
Meet smokey and them
If she need her hair done
I think my cousin can
I'll treat her like a queen
Give her everything
She will be my girl
Till we old and gray,
And I knew it from the moment,
That I saw her lovely, lovely face",There Goes My Baby,2010

And lies they only stop me from feeling free

The less I have the more I am a happy man

Because some may praise you just to get what they want

And I said mama I am not afraid
They will take what they will take
And what would life be like without a few mistakes

Y nunca protegí mi corazón

Porque ciego de amor
No pude ver, no quise ver

Que al final me dejo

Soñé vivir a tu lado
Un sueño fue
Ya todo ha pasado

Promesas que ya, has olvidado
Triste es la realidad
Y no, yo no supe interpretar
El engaño que ocultaba tu mirar

Y hoy, sólo queda realizar
Que todo aquello nunca fue verdad
Pero ciego de amor
No pude ver, no quise ver

La luz que brillaba ahora está apagada

Anda y dame
Que todavía hay esperanza
Que esto no se acaba

Donde está el amor
Que sentíamos tú
Y yo vagabundo anda mi corazón
Me acerco a tu cuerpo
Me entra el frío que yo siento

Donde está el amor
Que sentíamos tú
Y yo ya no dices nada
El silencio es tu voz

Donde está el cariño
Que a mí me enamoro
Dime donde está tu amor

Donde está el amor
Que sentíamos tú
Y yo vagabundo anda mi corazón
Me acerco a tu cuerpo
Me entra el frío que yo siento

",Donde Está el Amor,2000
Charlie Zaa,"Quisiera que supieras
Lo que sentí y sufrí y lloré
Quisiera que entendieras
Lo que es vivir sin mentir
Solo ser feliz, solo ser feliz

Yo que por años te creí a ti en todo
Yo fui el primero defendiendo tu amor
Pero esa noche lo vi con mis ojos
Bésalo ya, hay que decepción

Me engañaste, yo que te amado sólo
Yo que te lo he dado todo
Me has dejado tus mentiras
Me has robado el amor

¿Me engañaste, dime no te duele el alma?
Abusaste de mi confianza
Dime si esas noches llenas de pasión eran por mí
¿O si me engañaste?

Vete con él, se feliz, el a ti ja
No te conoce bien, yo se que el día llegará
Mi amor, cuando el dolor entro
En mi corazón pasara

Y yo que por años te creí a ti que tonto
Yo fui el último que supo la verdad
Pero esa noche lo vi con mis ojos
Mírame ya, no mientas más

Me engañaste, yo que te amado sólo
Yo que te lo he dado todo
Me has dejado tus mentiras
Me has robado el amor

¿Me engañaste, dime no te duele el alma?
Abusaste de mi confianza
Dime si esas noches llenas de pasión eran por mí
¿O si me engañaste?

No quiero nada de ti, ahora soy feliz
Nada en este mundo hará que yo llore por ti

Te odio y te quiero
Porque a ti te debo mis horas amargas
mis horas de miel
Te odio y te quiero
Fuiste el milagro la espina que duele y el beso de amor
Por eso te odio, por eso te quiero
Con toda la fuerza de mi corazón

No quiero nombrarte y busco en las copas
El vino de olvido que nunca se da
Pensando arrancarte busco en otras bocas
El fuego que borre tu beso immortal
Y todo es inútil, ni copas ni besos
Pueden separarte, separarte de mi
Te llevo en mi sangre te odio y te quiero
Y tengo en el pecho un infierno por ti

Te odio y te quiero

Moonlight painting silver to the
Sound of heartbeat.
Magical emotions take control,
Knowing we will meet before the night is over.

Then I gonna make you mine,
Love you till the end of time.

Take me to your heaven,
Hold on to a dream,
Take me to your heaven,
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together,
On a journey to the stars,
Won't you take me to your heaven to your heart.

I can feel your body next to mine,
Reaching for a kiss that keeps me, warm and tender,
Seven steps to heaven, show the way,
When I'm there I give myself the sweet surrender,

Then I gonna make you mine,
Love you till the end of time.

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

And no one was denied.

Or sun to shine by day,
It was the new Jerusalem

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
But is their bounty
What she needs

How can she chance
To love a little bit of earth
Does she not know
The earth is old
And doesn't care if
One small girl wants things to grow

She needs a friend
She needs a father
Brother, sister
Mother's arms
She needs to laugh
She needs to dance
And learn to work
Her girlish charms

She needs a home
The only thing she really needs
I cannot give
Instead she asks
A bit of earth
To make it live

She should have a pony
Gallop 'cross the moor
She should have a doll's house
With a hundred rooms per floor
Why can't she ask for a treasure
Something that money can buy
That won't die
When I'd give her the world
She asks instead
For some earth

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
Their beauty just the thing she needs

She'll grow to love the tender roses
Lilies fair, the iris tall
And then in fall, her bit of earth
Will freeze and kill them all

A bit of earth, a bit of earth,
A bit of earth, a bit of earth

On that Wednesday afternoon
We’d been numb as silent snow
We'd seen nothing but the moon
Mocking all the writing
I'd been forcing on the page
I've been dormant for too long now
Like I've been in hibernation
But I love you, you know
It's just I discovered
There's a life beneath the snow

I knew it could never have worked from the outset
That doesn't make this heartache easier to accept

Spending every waking moment
That I could with you
Now I'm wondering what you're doing
And I'm wondering if I'd like to do it too

I wish I could hate you
That way I could just forget you
Be a single girl and show the world
That I can live without you
Found myself in clutches
Of a panic since the break
I need closure
Want to hold you
Do you think we could just fake
Pretend the thaw never came
And act like nothing had changed

I knew it could never have worked from the outset
That doesn't make this heartache easier to accept

Spending every moment wondering
Can I call you yet
Though I know this must something
That we both will have to learn to accept

Now our love has melted
To a torrid overflow
And the ground’s all hard and barren
But I guess it's gonna take some time
To see something grow
Boy you'll be a long time ago

Then the rest of the crap will get solved.
Put me to work, 
You would think that by now I'm allowed.

In the time it takes a handkerchief to fall to the ground
One of our lives will be over
Brocade waistcoat catches glints of morning light
Silk damask swathed in bottle green memories

We've traveled from station to station
We now approach our final destination

So stand up straight and let me take on final taste of you

Before we walk the agreed number of paces
And turn to face our fate

You always had such exquisite taste

Stoop to take my final taste, one final taste of you

And ice crystals always have 6 points
Though every one's unique
They melt on the tongue and no one's ever counted them all
But you've tried

You so cool and calculated
A real cold fish

Have fallen from her curls.

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Took him out, and of his charms I had no doubt
Stayed drinking mojitos
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near
In my ear, he whispered and shed a tear
Oh my bambino
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near

Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart

Comme toutes les fleurs de province 
Moi je viens pour me trouver un prince
Un petit prince charmant
Qui me fera beaucoup d’enfants

Dans mon pays, ça n’pouvait plus durer
Je devenais une rosière mal arrosée
Depuis toujours je rêvais de Paris
La Salle Wagram, les grands boulevards et les Tuileries
Alors j’ai quitté ma famille 
Pour pas finir comme une vieille fille
Et me voilà, j’sais qu’j’ai les pieds plats
Mais vous verrez qu’ça s’arrangera

Vous allez voir ce que vous allez voir
Dans pas longtemps j’aurai ma photo dans France Soir
Je deviendrai la fille dans le vent
Ca va les rendre un peu jaloux à Perpignan

J’ai écumé tous mes voisins
J’ai honte j’ai même aguiché un cousin
Dans tous les mariages à minuit
Moi je me change en tapisserie

Célibataire cherche un mari
Gazou gazou, guilis guilis
J’veux qu’on me passe la bague au doigt
J’veux la robe blanche, tout l’tralala

Les gens me disent, c’est bien connu
On trouve quand on ne cherche plus
Mais en attendant j’ai personne
Et je suis nonne
Non j’ déconne
J’aimerais tant qu’aux douze coups
Mon lit se transforme en époux
J’veux une assurance sur ma vie
J’offre mon cœur en usufruit

Charlotte Marin,"Certaines font dans le repérage
Et le petit budget
C’est celles-là qui me dévisagent
Quand toute échevelée
Je surgis devant la vendeuse
Avec une jupe en skaï 
Elle calmerait ma fièvre acheteuse
Mais ils n’ont plus ma taille
 
J’ai une garde-robe
A devenir fringophobe
Mais j’en appelle à la clémence
La mode souffre d’inconstance
Je plaide la légitime dépense
Je pourrai tuer pour un string
Je suis crazy du shopping

J’suis boulimique, j’suis hystérique
Je passe, j’amasse, j’entasse
Des immettables aux basics
J’m’en fais une carapace 
J’achète comme d’autres cambriolent 
C’est à devenir folle 
Mon nom clignote sur toutes les fringues
C’est à devenir dingue

J’ai une garde-robe
A devenir fringophobe
Mais j’en appelle à la clémence
La mode souffre d’inconstance
Je plaide la légitime dépense
Je pourrai tuer pour un string
Je suis crazy du shopping

Le jour des soldes, rien à faire
Sous le rideau de fer
J’suis la première à me glisser
Dans cet enfer bradé
Ma carte bleue rougit d’avance
Et de honte et de rage
Elle sait bien que quand ça commence
Ça finit en carnage

J’ai une garde-robe
A devenir fringophobe
Mais j’en appelle à la clémence
La mode souffre d’inconstance
Je plaide la légitime dépense
Je pourrai tuer pour un string

Charlotte Marin,"Je n’ai aucun livre de cuisine
Ne sais aucune recette

Le seul livre que je dévore
Que je connais par corps
Que je sais sur le bout des doigts
C’est le kamasoutra

Je suis une gastronome, une croqueuse d’hommes

Je fais du sauté de gaillards 
Sur lit de satin noir
Et des chauds-froids de sensations
En simples suggestions
Quand je croise un Chilien, je fais
Du chili con carne
Et du premier Julien qui traîne 
Je fais une julienne

Je suis une gastronome, une croqueuse d’hommes

Je me mitonne sans préférence
Des requins d’la finance
Des chauds lapins, des p’tits agneaux
Et bien sûr des cœurs d’artichaut
Des pigeons que mon corps capture
Aux avocats bien mûrs 
Tous les goûts sont dans ma nature
Au rayon « démesure »

Je suis une gastronome, une croqueuse d’hommes

Je ne sers ni salade, ni flan
En accompagnement
Et les jours où je n’ai rien de mieux 
Je mets mes potes au feu 

Je suis une gastronome, une croqueuse d’hommes

J’évite les tueurs aux pruneaux 
Et les foies gras de poivrots
Les gros boudins, les tournedos  
Les thons et les maquereaux

Et à poil, j’en raffole

Charlotte Marin,"Tout avait si bien commencé
Joli buffet et bon champagne
Et puis minuit est arrivé
Et je suis partie en campagne

Nouvelle année, nouvelle vie
J’ai décidé de tout changer
Prenant à témoin mes amis
J’ai promis, j’ai juré :

Demain
Je reprends ma vie en main

Demain j’arrête la cigarette
Il fallait bien qu’un jour ça cesse
J’attendais ma première grossesse
Mais mon homme en serrant les dents
M’a assuré qu’on avait l’temps

Demain, j’achète une nuisette
Et des dessous affriolants
Car on oublie avec le temps
Que l’amour est un vrai combat
Qu’on ne gagne pas en pyjama
C’est promis, c’est juré :

Demain
Je reprends ma vie en main

Demain finis les calories
Il fallait bien qu’un jour ça cesse
De picorer comme on s’engraisse
Finie la balance qui agresse
Je commence régime et fitness 

Demain j’honore ma carte de sport
Jusqu’ici je n’avais ramé
Qu’ pour payer les mensualités
Mais demain je rame pour de bon
Pour tailler mes mensurations
C’est promis, c’est juré :

Demain
Je reprends ma vie en main

Demain j’entame tout un programme
Contrat minceur, patch et lingerie
Musée, lecture, économie
La vie ne perd rien pour attendre
Demain je renais de mes cendres
C’est promis, c’est juré :

Demain
Je reprends ma vie en main

J’avais promis, j’avais juré
Et puis demain est arrivé
J’me suis levée, la gueule de bois
Qui c’est ce mec, je l’ connais pas

J’ai pris ma clope et mon kawa
Et mes trois pains au chocolat
J’avais l’excuse du jour férié
Le club de sport était fermé
J’me suis vautrée dans l’canapé
L’œil ventousé à la télé
Mais demain c’est juré…",Demain J'Arrete,

Soirée pyjama
Ça les rassure

Comme des gamines
Un peu trop mûres
Pleurant en jogging
D’vant Dirty Dancing

P’tit débriefing…

J’ai préparé un apéro
Digne de ce nom
Une farandole de p’tits gâteaux
Et du Chinon
Pour accompagner les ragots
Il faut c’qui faut
Alors que tout le monde s’immole
Au guacamole
C’est Zaza qui ouvre le bal
Son couple va mal

Je me cale au fond du sofa
Il t’a dit ça ?
Attends, j’allume une cigarette
Faut qu’il arrête

Il n’y a pas d’ meilleur oasis
Qu’un ex qui disait « si j’te perds
Ma vie s’ra un supplice »

Je choisis ma plus belle victime
Dans mon ancien tableau de chasse
Et je l’invite juste pour la rime
A passer le week-end à Grasse

Barbecue entre vieux copains

Bien sûr tu peux ramener quelqu’un

Ils sont arrivés au dessert
En célébrant à demi-mot

Ils sont partis dans un fou rire

Un coup de boule sans commentaire
Aurait détendu l’atmosphère 

Elle c’est le genre à vous coller
Une dépression carabinée
Cul pigeonnant, Q.I. énorme

Pour distribuer ses p’ tits baisers
Quand elle a demandé un café
J’ai vu tous mes potes se lever

A moitié nue dans un transat
Pendant que mes meilleurs amis
Prouvaient qu’l’homme descend du primate

Que c’est laid une fille sans bourrelet

Y’a quelques mois sous mon tipi

Aussi r’montée qu’mon décolleté

Charlotte Marin,"Fatiguée des baisers volés
Je trouvais le monde sans pitié
Et puis soudain l’été dernier
Voilà qu’un rendez-vous de juillet
A fait de moi sa belle de nuit
L’amour aux trousses on s’est enfui

Pendant neuf semaines et demi
Comme des enfants du paradis
On s’est aimé à bout portant
Sous le soleil de Satan
La fièvre au corps, au cœur, à l’âme
On s’est donné tout feu, tout flamme

Je me souviens d’ son ton flingueur
Et de sa scarface de menteur
Quand je l’ai pris la main au collet
D’une autre femme qu’il embrassait
Liaison fatale, liaisons dangereuses
Dernier tango pour les valseuses

C’est bon je connais la chanson
Tu n’auras pas mon grand pardon
Fallait pas jouer à l’éléphant 
Qui trompe toujours énormément
Tu as tenté l’aveu, les pleurs
Et je t’ai fait un goldfinger

Même si on dit qu’certains l’aiment chaud
La vengeance est un buffet froid
Tu peux me faire Fort Alamo
L’appartement il est à moi
Tu vas r’gretter ton jour de fête
Ta p’tite Cleo de cinq à sept

T’as gâché nos plus belles années
J’en ai des vertigos, j’en tremble
Même si nous nous sommes tant aimés
Nous ne vieillirons pas ensemble
Quand la grande illusion s’écroule
On a vraiment les Raging bull

Mon désir s’est brûlé les ailes
Tu m’dis et la tendresse bordel
Arrête ton charabia Ben Hur

Vraiment j’te dis Rio Bravo

Elle va m’envahir
Plus rien ne peut la retenir

J’me prends la tête entre les mains
J’essaie d’appuyer sur des points
Je les masse pour me soulager
Mais j’sens l’étau se resserrer
Je me concentre sur la douleur
J’ai des nausées, j’ai mal au cœur 
Je tape contre le mur, le front en sueur
J’ai mal et j’ai peur

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine
La migraine

D’abord la souffrance est latente
Mais vite elle devient lancinante
A la dérive dans mon lit
Je cherche une porte de sortie
Un gant d’eau fraîche et des cachets
Mais rien ne paraît faire effet
Et moi la jeune fille en fleur
Je fane de douleur

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine

C’est la personne non grata
Qui vient dès qu’on ne l’attend pas
Je suis étendue dans le noir
Un voile opaque sur le regard
J’ai le sentiment qu’un battant
Vient s’écraser sur mes tympans
Et à mesure qu’ils résonnent 
Moi je déraisonne

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine
La migraine

C’est comme un tremblement de tête
Qui grimpe sur l’échelle de Richter
Rien à faire pour que ça s’arrête
Avant le degré de l’enfer
J’peux entendre mon sang circuler
Son flux est comme précipité
Cette fois je crois qu’j’ai tout tenté
J’ai plus qu’à m’flinguer

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison

Ecoute jusqu’à la fin
Déjà ton attention chavire

Avant qu’il nous dévore

Je n’ai pas les mots pour t’entendre
Et ce n’est pas mon rôle
Mon rôle à moi c’est d’être tendre
Mais quand l’amour te frôle
Tu me repousses et te replies
Te replies sur toi-même

Sans pouvoir dire « je t’aime »

L’amour se fait dans un lit

Je vois combien ces mots font mal
Dans ton regard glacial
Tu me dévisages comme si
Comme si j’avais trahi
Trahi la confiance entre nous
En te traitant de fou
Mais la folie c’est de s’enfuir
Pour semer ses souvenirs

Tu prends des poses, tu es nerveux
Quand on est en soirée
Tu dis qu’on serait mieux à deux
Mais dans l’intimité
Tu as sans cesse un air gêné
Même après des années
Et comment partager mon lit

Tu dis que tu n’as pas ni le temps
Ni l’envie, ni l’argent
D’aller confier ton passé
Devant un étranger
Tu dis qu’ tu n’en as pas besoin
Et que j’exagère
Mais comment partager demain
Sans partager hier

Tu dis que c’est tellement commode
Et tellement à la mode
De se regarder le nombril 
Tu crois que c’est facile
Pourtant rien n’est plus difficile
Que de se libérer 
Que d’accepter d’être fragile
Que d’accepter d’aimer

L’amour se fait dans un lit
Pas sur le divan d’un psy

Is easy to do
The things that you wanted
Well I bought them for you

Graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you
Just slide through my hands

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
And now you've decided
To show me the same

No sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamt you
A sin and a lie
And I have my freedom
But I don't have much time

Fate has been suffered
And tears must be cried
So let's do some living
After we die

Interdimensional, hidden inside

Marching ahead to silent beats
Bumping into these dead machines

You can win everyone but me

And grow accustomed to the darkness

And I don't think I'll think

In the longest of stares we were sinking
Ashes to beauty; rust in lust
Passion attempts; misguided trust
Smoking your bag of trickery
Getting to love the little beast

In this waiting room

In a neglected olive tree

Say that you have no need of this
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again

We watch the whole world fall apart
And melt into an ether sea

You failed to take me by the hand
I failed to make you understand
That all I wanted was your hands

And there's too many sad goodbyes
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And just a little higher now
Am I an inch away from heaven?

The stones have names

And there is no one I can blame
Because your heart remained the same
I swear I'll never let you go

And there's too many sad goodbyes
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And just a little higher now

And not be the victim
All twisted up by my own pride
Am I to be stranded
Just waving my arms in the air
While you're trying to lie

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest ocean
Existing in the water
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe his name
I opened up my eyes

I found myself alone, alone, alone 
Above the raging sea
That stole the only boy I loved
And drowned him deep inside of me

I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was forced out
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing, ""Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow
Oh my heart, Oh my heart shies from the sorrow""

Well I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or should I lie with death, my bride?

But you don't even care for me, you don't even care for me
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy
Oh, why don't you care for me, why don't you care for me?
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy
Oh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Anymore, not anymore

Your cold hands in Paris
They've been swaying me left, swaying me right
In the middle of a fight
I'm embarrassed in Paris
Tried my best, it's not enough
I'm tired of unrequited love

But you don't even care for me, you don't even care for me
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy
Oh, why don't you care for me, why don't you care for me?
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy

I think I'd rather end up lonely
Than walk these streets together
Oh, there is nothing you could show me
I've been trapped inside this feeling forever

Oh, but you don't even care for me, you don't even care for me
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy
Oh, why don't you care for me, why don't you care for me?
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy
Oh, you don't even care for me, you don't even care for me
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy
Oh, why don't you care for me, why don't you care for me?
I don't wanna be your enemy, your enemy

The spirit alive is calling my name
The healer inside will pray for the lonely
Remember the time you stole me away

You didn't know me but once in my veins
You had a whole but nothing to say
You got it all now the spirit alive is calling my name

I don't know what you do but it's making me better

Can you take me to heaven?
Can you love, can we love, can we love, can we love forever?

Can't concentrate on anything
Why does my heart skip?
Why do i trip?

Fell like a yo-yo
The highs and the low lows
Happening all at same time

Isn't it a lot like love?
Isn't this the way it feels?
The naked emotion you can't conceal
Isn't it a lot like love?
Is that what's coming over me
Is that why i need you so desperately

My friends think it's weird
Like i disappeared
I guess it's true
They criticize
But they would know why
If they wore my shoes
Nobody told me
If I let you hold me
It would come down to this
I come undone
When you do that something
What is it about your kiss?

Isn't it a lot like love?
Isn't this the way it feels?
The naked emotion you can't conceal
Isn't it a lot like love?
Is that what's coming over me
Is that why i need you so desperately

Charlotte Perrelli,"Everything has a beginning
Everything comes to an end
Take it or leave it, you better believe it
Be my lover, be my friend
Try to deny what you're feeling
And you know that you're heart will say no
Love will last longer, growing stronger and stronger
If you stay and don't let go

Oh, out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking a fight is a life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love and compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Heaven and earth keep colliding
But we love on a world of its own
Oh, there you can fake it, just make it or break it
Only you can find the one

Oh, out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking a fight is a life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love and compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Oh, survive
Heroes can live on their own
But heroes never die alone

Oh, out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking a fight is a life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love and compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out of the light, like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Charlotte Ritchie,"Someone said that in each life some rain is bound to fall
And each one sheds his share of tears
And trouble troubles us all
But the hurt can't hurt forever
And the tears are sure to dry

And it won't rain always
The clouds will soon be gone
The sun that they've been hiding has been there all along

And it won't rain always
God's promises are true
The sun's gonna shine in His own good time
And He will see you through",It Won't Rain Always,2002
Charlotte Ritchie,"How sweet to hold 
Our newborn baby
And feel the pride
And the joy that he gives
But greater still
The calm assurance
We can face uncertain days
We can face uncertain days
Because he lives
Sing it with us

And because he lives
I can face tomorrow
Because he lives
All fear is gone
Because I know he holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives

And then one day 
We'll all cross the river
And fight life's final war with pain
And then, as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he reigns

Because he lives
I can face tomorrow
Because he lives
All fear is gone
Because I know he holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives

It looks like you're guilty now what do you say
I spoke up your honor I have no defense
But that's when mercy walked in

[Chorus]
Mercy walked in and pleaded my case
Called to the stand God's saving grace
The blood was presented that covered my sin
Forgiven when mercy walked in

Praise the lord

That someone so guilty had just been set free
My chains were broken I felt born again
