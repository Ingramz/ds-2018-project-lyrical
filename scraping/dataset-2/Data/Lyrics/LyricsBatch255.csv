Female,"If I were your woman and you were my man,
you'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb.
If you had the strength to walk out that door,
My love would over rule my sense, and I'd call you back for more,
If I were your woman.
If I were your woman, and you were my man. Um baby.
 
She tears you down darlin', says you're nothing at all.
But, I'll pick you up darling, when she lets you fall.
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass.
Yet you beg her to love you, but, me you don't ask.
If I were your woman, If I were your woman.
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do,
I'd never, no, no, stop loving you.
Yeah, yeah, um
 
Life is so crazy, a love is unkind.
Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me, and you don't even know it.
I'm what you need, but I'm too afraid to show it.
If I were your woman, If I were your woman, 
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.
Never, no, no, no, stop loving you, ah, yeah.
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.
Never, never stop loving you if
 

",If I Were Your Woman,1995
Female,"Looking out on the morning rain I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have face another day.
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
 
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(What you've done to me')
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside.)
And I just want to be 
(Want to be)
Close to you. 
You make me feel so alive!
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural, natural woman.

Singing in the tree it is quite absurd

Female Ensemble,"Joseph's coat annoyed his brothers
Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us and
There's only one of him
The dreams of course will not come true
That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?

The dreams are more than crystal clear,
The writing on the wall
Means that Joseph some day soon
Will rise above us all
The accuracy of the dreams
We brothers do not know
But one thing we are sure about
The dreamer
Has to go",Joseph's Dreams,1993

Could you use a slave,
You hairy bunch of Ishmaelites?

Going cheap and he reads and writes

In a trice the dirty deal was done
Silver coins for Jacob's favourite son

Red magic satin playing near, too

Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

So happy and loud

From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue

""Is it cool?""

See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'

Yo what's happening?
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin
Time travelin

Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this

Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, ""Rah, give back what you receivin""
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport

To burst a lung singing from the needles in my chest
And it was so bright and clear not a cloud in the sky
And in the distance there's a girl who's trying to get high

And I'm pretty sure I don't remember anyone

He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight, can't hit those breaks
This is what you wanted, huh
But you got it all in vein
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name it goes

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

Let me ash my issues
Ashtray is this asphalt
American spirits, black coffee, conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Then when you pictured it on that back porch, and I'm gone
World traveler all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light and guess who tried it
Shit I'm blinded by this lime light
This lime light, it's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on, you can't walk away
Don't die here, don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared and I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids closed, light turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

I live this way
I live this way

Ferdinando Faraò,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1997
Ferenc Snétberger,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1997
Fergal Matthews,"Decaying as I am
I need not some promised land
I know I am failing
Acceptance was the plan

No silence in the sea
Nothing tranquil awaits me
Useless and used up
Too much using to do

I have chosen everything
This is what makes it so bad
No matter what the action
Situation was created by me
My life is different
This grey streets will only get me down
They will never fool me
And integrate me as a clown

Decaying as I am
Need not some promised land
I know I am failing
Acceptance was the plan

Nothing tranquil awaits me
Useless and used up

Fergal Matthews,"The dreams of dying mothers 
I awoke my insides shuddered 
The grey coats of the infantry 
Victims looking for sympathy 
The splash of October swimmers 
The cheers of Helsinki winners 
My barbed bones of futility 
Leaking morrow of ability 
I don t need anyone 
You don't need anyone 
I want to be a happy boy 
This means that you must employ my lies 
When I want you 
I don't need anyone",October Swimmer,1999

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full, or is it half empty?
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down, (down), down, (down), down

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
(Ha yeah, who really cares?)

Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation *yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness, remember life's beautiful
Still I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (more)
More (more) more, more, more

It's time to take this out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really, really really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari

I’ll never let you go
So never let me go
I will be a journey
and you will be my road
Down the stormy path
Love will never come to pass
You will be our anchor
All over the winds may blow

Chorus
And through the depths of high and low
Wherever you will go I’ll follow
To the end
Back again, you know
Won’t let you fall
Fall out of love
‘Cause together we’ll be holding on
‘Cause all we have is us
Won’t let you go
Go away again
Because I don’t need nothing at all
If I don’t have your love

Verse 2
I will dry your tears
Take away your fears
Let me be your shelter
Your heart is safe in here
So beautiful and pure
Nothing I would not endure
Ooh,  love has got me blinded
I can see it all so clear

Fergie,"Baby, baby, when you're looking deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my make-up
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought
Tryin' to be strong
You can see the hurt in me
The cover-ups so secretly
And all that I aspire to be
You see, you see
You know who I really am
No entourage or caravan
And do you even give a damn
About all that, tell me?

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

So, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
Cause I'm not tryin' to rush anything
But when I look into your eyes
I'm not scared as you say I see little you
I'm in the picture too
Like a happy family tree
We're together constantly
This could be eventually
We'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know
Is with me, baby, will you grow?
Sun and rain and heavy snow
Oh, tell me so now, baby

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

It's as simple as one and two
I'm in love with you
And three and four
You're all I adore
To the seven and eight
See, I've been making mistakes
Cause when you're on my mind
I just can't think straight
Back to the five and six
I'm all in you mix, and I'm all into you
Without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal
You remain the same angel that I fell for you
For real, for real

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking
I must go alone
I must take the baby steps till I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine
Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers, and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you

Ever since I was a baby girl, I had a dream
Cinderella theme
Crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
But I would have to wait
Make so many mistakes
I couldn't comprehend
As I watched it unfold
This classic story told, I left it in the cold
Walking through un-open doors that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth
I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Mmm

I remember the beginning you already knew
I acted like a fool
Just trying to be cool
Frontin' like it didn't matter
I just ran away
Put on another face
Was lost in my own space
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
I was scared to give up me
Afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the mess that I had made
Finally got out of my own way
I finally started living for today
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Now my destiny can begin

Is this me up in the mirror?
'Cause I thought it was somebody else

Who do I turn to?

Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?

And get my life back together again
Well, this place is all a masquerade
So tell me, where in line can I cut in?

Still don't know what I'm tryin' to find
Well, you could flash all the pretty lights in front of me
I still wouldn't see the signs

Fergie,"Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of

I already know what my addiction is
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
I shop for purses while love walks out the door
Don't cry, buy a bag and get over it
And, I'm not concerned with all the politics
It's a lot of men I know I could find another.

What I know is that I'm always happy when I walk out the store (store)
store
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him, tryna' to walk a mile in my kicks

Love's like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on

I know I might come off as negative
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
But relationships are often so hard to tame
A Prada dress has never broken my heart before
And, ballin's something that I'm fed up with
I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
'Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames (flames)
I guess Supercalifragi-sexy, nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him, tryna' to walk a mile in my kicks

Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on.

Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach
Buying things is hard to say
Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but
I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love

Oh, love's like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry

I must go alone
I must take the baby steps till I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers, and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home

I had to turn my heart away

Smiled like the sun
Kisses like real
And tales - it never fails

And I bet you're gonna ambush me
You'll have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?

Oh, ooo

Oh, back over time we were all trying for free
Met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong 
Selling a song, a name!

Whisper game
And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the wick
Ooo, Barracuda?

""Sell me, sell you,"" the porpoise said
Dive down deep now, and save my head
You... 
I think you got the blues, too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools
Silly, silly fools

Now, if the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the wick

Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of

I already know what my addiction is
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
I shop for purses while love walks out the door
Don't cry, buy a bag and get over it
And, I'm not concerned with all the politics
It's a lot of men I know I could find another.

What I know is that I'm always happy when I walk out the store (store)
store
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him, tryna' to walk a mile in my kicks

Love's like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on

I know I might come off as negative
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
But relationships are often so hard to tame
A Prada dress has never broken my heart before
And, ballin's something that I'm fed up with
I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
'Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames (flames)

Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more.
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on.

Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach
Buying things is hard to say
Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but
I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love

Oh, love's like a runway but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on

You want to know about love?

Please be gentle, sentimental
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat

Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi

You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti

And I've thought of angels as I saw her there

Bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry the cross that is more than her share
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I know some kids in an orphan's home
Who think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely

As I gaze at that ringless finger

But deep down inside my whole world depended on you
I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain

And there was nothing I could do
Because I knew the Gods were angry with me for loving you

Ferlin Husky,"Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now has withered and gone
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
The roses have faded there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord if you hear me please hold to my hand please understand
Oh where has she gone to oh where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away

I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

There's a family Bible on the table each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory
At the end of day when work was over and when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sittin'...

If we'd find more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me

Be not dismayed when man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done

Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life the battle is won
Caring the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done

Misunderstood, the savior of sinners, hung on the cross he was God's only son
Oh hear Him call to His father in heaven, let not my will but Thine be done.

If when you've tried and failed in your trying, hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun
Take up your cross and come quickly to Jesus, He'll understand and say well done.



",He'll Understand and Say Well Done,1963
Ferlin Husky,"You'll meet many just like me upon life's busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed down and eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
Now you've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were propers some were kings and some were masters of arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where you start
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken hearts",Men With Broken Hearts,1963
Ferlin Husky,"Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last

Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play when evening shadows come
Then winding down that old familiar pathway I heard my mother call at set of sun
Some of the fondest mem'ries of my childhood are woven around suppertime
When mother used to call from the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home Ferlin it's suppertime what I would give to hear that once more
But for me time has woven a realization of the truth that's even more thrilling
And that's when the call comes up from the portal of glory to come home
For it's suppertime when all of God's children shall gather around the table
With the Lord at the greatest suppertime of them all
Come home come home...

WRITERS PAUL EVANS, AL BYRON

A long, long time ago On graduation day You handed me your book I signed this way: ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But not as sweet as you."" We dated through high school. And when the big day came, I wrote into your book, next to my name: ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But not as sweet as you."" Then I went far away And you found someone new I read your letter dear And I wrote back to you: ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But luck may god bless you. ""Is that your little girl? She looks a lot like you. Someday some boy will write in her book, too. ""Roses are red, my love. Violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love. But not as sweet as you.""

They all think they're pretty smart but rose don't have a second hand heart
I love a little girl who lives across the way I go to see her nearly every day
But when I get the money I'll take her far away
So they can't gather around her and say
Second hand shoes
They tease her about her clothes and things
It's hard to believe some folks can be so mean
But when I get the money I'll buy her the best 
I'll take rose you can have all the rest

Ferlin Husky,"Friends, my name is Ferlin Husky.
I'd like to tell you 'bout a man that let alcohol 
destroy everything that God gave him

I saw an accident one day that would chill the heart of any man
It would teach them not to drink a drop 
While the steering wheel's in their hand

This awful accident occurred on the 20th day of May
And caused two little children to be sleepin' beneath the clay
These two little kids walked side by side along the state highway
Their poor old mother, she had died
And their daddy had ran away

As these two little children walked arm in arm
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curb came a speeding car
With a drunk man at the wheel
The drunk man saw the little kids
And he hollered a drunked sound
""Get out of the road you little fools""
And the car, it brought them down

The bumper struck the little girl, takin' her life away
While the little boy, in a puddle of blood
In the ditch, lyin' there did lay
The drunk man staggered from his car 
To see the damage that he had done
And then he let out a yell you could hear for miles
When he recognized his dyin' son

Such mournin' from a drunken man, I've never heard before
While kneeling down by his car he prayed to heavens door
Sayin', ""Oh God, please forgive me for this awful crime I've done""
And his attention then was called away 
By the words of his dyin' son
He said, ""Daddy, why did you do this to us
How come you run us to the ground?
It was you and Mummy we were talkin' about, 
When the car, it brought us down
And I was just tellin' little sister
That I knew we'd see you again someday
But, Daddy, why did it have to be this way
Why did it",Drunken Driver,1963
Ferlin Husky,"I just don't like this kind of living when nobody's lonesome for me
I'm heading down the long lost highway may you never be alone like me
Your cold cold crazy cheating heart gave me the lovesick blues
I can't help it if you win again you know I still want you
I'd like to turn back the years when we heard the wedding bells chime
When I was howling at the moon and your cheating heart was mine
A mansion on the hill is a house without love
Why don't you love me like you used to do
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave but I could never be ashamed of you
I hear that lonesome whistle blowing never again will I knock on your door
I'm sorry for you my friend but why should we try anymore

I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
Now home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars and at night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find that I've just been wastin' my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride get on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones all the loved ones that I left waiting so far behind
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home

Can you wait until I'm makin' up to get us through the winter
For the days are short and cold and work is scarce

Anything that it would tell me that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life is the thing that I can't win

And if I could you know that I would fly away with you

She'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay

Sweet mem'ries when will you go away when will I be free from yesterday
Sweet mem'ries your love has come and gone
But a touch of yesterday keeps hanging on

Sweetheart it would be easier for me to walk on water
Than for me to find the way to forget you
I cried myself to sleep last night and this morning I cried harder
And relived the very moment that I met you
I never thought I'd see the day I'd be praying for an ending
An ending to be only love I've known
If our goodbye had been strong enough to destroy our beginning
Then my reason to remember would be gone

Well today I was barrelin' down old 66

And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough

A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddy up go
Well I pushed old Giddy up go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop

Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck

And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66

And he's handled that big rig

And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town

Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by

Ferlin Husky,"I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on Channel 1-9
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line

And he said, ""Breaker 1-9, is anyone there?
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear""
I keyed the mike and I said, ""You got it, Teddy Bear""
And the little boy's voice came back on the air

""Appreciate the breaker who we got on that end""
I told him my handle and then he began
""Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air""

But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled and I can't walk
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
But I guess it's mine and mom's now 'cause my daddy's dead
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blinding snow

Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet
She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night

You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see
Oh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me
But you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone

Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town

Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' someday
This old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear
But I know now I'll never get a ride on 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends

Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you

Well, I came back and I said before you go 10-10
What's your home twenty, little CB friend
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait

I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street two two nine
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one the heck of a shock
Eighteen-wheeler were lined up for three city blocks

I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again

Well, you better believe I took my turn rifin' Teddy Bear
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy, if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man

We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone
He shook my hand with a mile long grin
And said, ""So long trucker, I'll catch you again""
Ah, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes

I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker 1-9 came the voice on the air
Just one word of thanks from mama, Teddy Bear
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you
Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now before I start to cry
May God ride with you 10-4 and goodbye",Teddy Bear,2001

When they have passed away

Over the sleeping clay

Roses they can not see
Let us not wait til souls have flaked

And to know that my name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching but really she makes no mistakes
I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Savior to look
And when he come up descending from heaven on a cloud like he said in his word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of the great speckled bird",Great Speckled Bird,2002

(Thomas Ramsey - Charles E. Durham)
Â« Â© '51 Writer Share, PD Â»

When I come to the river at ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way
For I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Jesus died for my sins to atone
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone...

And how his first word about that old truck was Giddy up go
Well today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough

A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddy up go
Well I pushed old Giddy up go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop

Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck

And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66

And he's handled that big rig
Better than any gear jammer that I'd ever seen

Ferlin Husky,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday

Pero todo tiene que tener su inicio con un verbo
Como el nacer, produce el nacimiento

Y la verdad produce arrepentimiento
Se necesita acción en todos los procesos
Se necesita a Dios en este comienzo

Nosotros seguiríamos siendo polvo en el suelo
De no ser por su aliento en nuestro cuerpo

Y empezamos a crear nuestras propias divisiones
Formamos sindicatos para separarnos

Y poder hacer y deshacer lo que queramos
Dimos la espalda al que nos había creado
Al independizarnos perdimos el contrato

Donde estaba todo escrito y estipulado
Donde se encontraba el mapa para regresarnos
Ahora volvemos a necesitarlo

Requerimos un regalo para así reconciliarnos
Pero no tenemos nada con que comprarlo
Y muchos ni queremos solucionarlo

Es la mezcla, la mezcla perfecta, es la mezcla perfecta

Que haremos para reunirnos de nuevo
Si nuestros edificios no llegan hasta el cielo
Por mas que intentemos no lo lograremos

Lo único es que perdemos nuestro tiempo
Es como si quisieramos tapar el sol con un dedo
Por eso nos volvemos ciegos

Y Dios tuvo que bajar para recogernos
Como un regalo que no merecemos
Como la mezcla perfecta es como volvemos

Para vivir hasta el fin de los tiempos eternamente

Fern,"I think I'm the worst rapper on this entire song
You know what it is
Or, if you don't, you're about, you're about to know

I don't need a stylist
I'm only wearin' black
And my homies are wylin'
We all love Taylor Swift
I'm eatin' with pilots, they callin' me the chef
I'm saucin' it up
No directions, we made it from scratch
Fear God tee on
Shout out to Jerry Lorenzo
They callin' me ugly
I'ma still marry a ten though
And I'm killin' the friendzone
I'ma kneel in the endzone
And my ex had nothin' inside, so you know that I hopped out a window
Anti-political, only makin' songs that I like
This is anti-radio
No placements, won't make it to top five
And high five to my team, we don't respond to anybody on the sidelines
And I shoulda died
Like, I don't know, but it feels like I got nine lives 

I came in this with, like, four friends (four up)
Tube socks and Chuck Taylors on
I stayed in this and gave no cares (not one)
Now I'm moonwalkin' on every song
Area code is 7-6-0, 6-1-9, 8-5-8
Think I'm great, think y'all late
That's okay
Marty, let me come up in this party like I'm Scarface
To point the finger at the bad guy (go ahead)
At four years old I been a rabbi (gotta leave)
Let me show you how to do this (I do it)
I just need a pencil and a pad
Guy, follow me now
Couple record companies tryna call on me now
Tell 'em all to hit they knees and acknowledge the style
It came from God
Man, I got my game from God
Ain't a dollar that can move me from the reign of God
I'm in this buildin' hollerin' West!
Hold on, let me go and take a rest, I ain't yellin' at y'all (what)
I'm just tryna hit you with some evidence y'all (what)
Evidently heaven sent me excellence y'all
I just wanna be a legend
I just wanna speak to the people
I just wanna play my sounds, make my rounds
Love God, live life
Do it all legal, it's easy

Don't ask me a question
If you don't wanna hear what my answer is, I'm gonna answer it
I got no time for the drama
I got no time for the politics
I do not care about names
They don't mean nothin' to me
I didn't get in the game to make friends
And kiss up to people that don't even like me
You know what I mean!
I don't expect everybody to like what I'm doin' out here
But I am the one that's gon' look in the mirror at the end of the day
You don't want my career
I got some people that write me like, ""I wish you'd die like your momma did""
These are the comments that I gotta problem with
You should be quiet and watch what you hollerin', woo!
My fans will eat you alive
Trolls, get off of my page
My bars fly over they heads
I wrote that line on a plane, I wrote that line on a plane
You won't see me in a chain
I basically wear the same shirt everyday
Get a hole in it, go the store and I buy it again
You already know who it is, for real

Still on the coast where they throw the set
'Palas still bounce like Hammer checks
Papi gon' get 'em like Dangerfield
Orale, you don't get no respect
Labels that hit Fern and Marty up
Marty and Fern never call 'em back
""You tryna be funny?"", was all they asked
Look at the charts, who laughin' last?
Now I'm signed, need contracts
My God is major, my league minor
Throwin' numbers up, need contact
These beats remind of Scott Steiner
Andy killed it on Sway's show
So I best be workin' my one-liners
Still pray for that skyline, boy's lit the shots at those one-timers
I just wanna see hands in the air, my Lord
Never thought rappin' would keep us employed
Feelin' like Pacquiao I'm fightin' with Floyd
The family watchin'
I better go hard in the paint, that '96 Rodman
Shots out to Eric, I got 'em
Dog days in the Cali' summer
Life's hard, this beat's harder
Rest in peace out to Harold Hunter
All praise to the Holy Father
All the smoke was secondhand
Either way we'll never land
Say a prayer 'fore I come around
Blood of Jesus, please wipe me down
New York

I wake up from my bed
Look over, kiss my lil' girl in the head
'Cause everyday is Father's Day
Just like everyday is a birthday, you dig?
Third of the three little pigs
The wisest one, I build my house up with bricks
So when the storm came, we just came together in the Lord's name
Bruh, I sold drugs
Bruh, I been grimy
Lord's stackin', you can ask 'bout me
Had the OG's, they respected me
The younger boys not remember me
I was in them streets in the background
Was your ganstar's gangsta, I spit game for free
Nowadays when I recollected and I put it down, gotta pay me
When you say Hollywood, gotta say me
When it comes to these raps and these APs
Cadillacs always been a M.O
Even when the old school broke down
I'll patch 'em up, hit the skrip with 'em
It's no surprise a brother on now
When the streets get a chance to speak up
They want a brother that's gon' eat with 'em
Speak up about the same issues and run it straight
Ain't gon' play with 'em
My contents done changed up, so them twelve year olds need a young sheperd
Looked at Santino right in his eyes
He broked out laughin', he's so reckless
He know I got now, it's no pressure
But when it's his turn, let the grits burn
That Lawrence Fishburne
But it's on record how his old boy spit it like an old veteran
Fernie
Aha, I was old boy spitting like an old veteran

I'm in a lane by myself
Ain't checkin' for nobody else
Whole team lookin' monsterish
Don't really care for they acknowledgments

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2008
Fern Lindzon,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

E o sol
Beija o barco e luz

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

Tudo isso traz
Uma calma de verão
E então
O barquinho vai
E a tardinha cai

Des cils d’un centimètre ou deux
Du sexe appeal un peu partout

Lorsque je vous ai vue pour la première fois
Vous étiez au jardin, arrosant des petits pois
Quand je vous ai souri vous me fîtes l’honneur
De me dire Monsieur vous m’avez bien faut peur
Et j’ai pensé que ce Dimanche
M’avait placé sur le chemin
Du bonheur cueillit sous les branches
Et j’ai murmuré : A demain
Vous n’êtes pas venue Lundi
Je vous ai attendu Mardi
J’ai remis ça le mercredi
J’ai pensé peut-être Jeudi
Et j’ai poireauté Vendredi
Vous n’étiez pas là Samedi
J’ai passé la semaine ainsi
Le Dimanche j’avais saisi

Mais comme je voulais vous revoir à tout prix
J’avoue que ce retard m’avait un peu surpris
Je me suis dis : Hector ! faut te faire une raison
Et je suis revenu devant votre maison
Car j’ai pensé que ce Dimanche
Mettrait votre en  émoi
Et j’ai attendu sous les branches
Et comptant les jours sur les doigts

Vous n’étiez pas là en Janvier
J’ai attendu tout février
J’ai remis ça, Mars, Avril, Mai
J’ai eu chaud de Juin à Juillet
J’ai transpiré tout le mois d’Août
Vint septembre, octobre c’est fou
Novembre, j’ai eu froid partout
En décembre j’étais à bout

Hélas ! je ne dors plus, car je ne comprend pas
Cette absence voulue et je me dis tout bas
Viendra-t-elle un beau soir ? Viendra-t-elle un beau jour ?
Pour que je puisse enfin lui dire mon amour
En pensant qu joli Dimanche
De la saison des petits pois
J’erre comme un fou sous les branches
Car depuis le doute est en moi

Je vous ai attendu un an
Deux ans, trois ans, quatre ans, dix ans
Vous n’étiez pas là, et pourtant

Por causa de um ciúme banal
Um erro de um minuto não pode ter valor, 
Se eu vivi com você 24 horas de amor

Não sabe ouvir um não

Uma coisa diferente em mim

Uma história sem começo e fim
Ela entrou no meio da noite,
Tem a chave do meu coração
De repente soltou seus cabelos
Me entreguei sem ter reação

Uma mistura de querer e dor

Ela é sol é chuva de
Verão
O seu charme me fez prisioneiro
Invadiu de vez meu

Fernando De Carvalho Orchestra,"Perguntaste-me outro dia
Se eu sabia o que era o fado
Disse-te que não sabia
Tu ficaste admirado
Sem saber o que dizia
Eu menti naquela hora
Disse-te que não sabia
Mas vou-te dizer agora

Almas vencidas
Noites perdidas
Sombras bizarras
Na Mouraria
Canta um rufia
Choram guitarras
Amor ciúme
Cinzas e lume
Dor e pecado
Tudo isto existe
Tudo isto é triste
Tudo isto é fado

Se queres ser o meu senhor
E teres-me sempre a teu lado
Não me fales só de amor
Fala-me também do fado
E o fado é o meu castigo
Só nasceu pra me perder
O fado é tudo o que digo
Mais o que eu não sei dizer",Tudo Isto É Fado [Everything Is Fado],2012
Fernando DeFreitas,"Ai Mouraria
Da velha Rua da Palma,
Onde eu um dia
Deixei presa a minha alma,
Por ter passado
Mesmo a meu lado
Certo fadista
De cor morena,
Boca pequena
E olhar trocista.

Ai Mouraria
Do homem do meu encanto
Que me mentia,
Mas que eu adorava tanto.
Amor que o vento,
Como um lamento,
Levou consigo,
Mais que inda agora
A toda a hora
Trago comigo.

Ai Mouraria
Dos rouxinóis nos beirais,
Dos vestidos cor-de-rosa,
Dos pregões tradicionais.

Das procissões a passar,
Da Severa em voz saudosa,
Da guitarra a soluçar.",Ai Mouraria,2002
Fernando Deluqui,"Quando a luz do sol invade o céu
ilumina a péle de mulher
e o topo da montanha de cristal
acendendo a terra até o luar
água nasce e corre,vai serpenteando
por entre a mata verde,saciando a sede

Essa beleza e muita paz,cabocla
o que preciso só vc é que traz
Pura beleza e muita paz
é o que eu quero e aqui contigo eu vo ficar

contigo eu vo ficar...

dando a vida a graça natural
nuvens cor de rosa enfeitam o lar 
da moça com sorriso sem igual
como vou dizer 
que um raio de luar não brilha mais do que a luz que vem do seu
olhar.

Or so it seems (yes so it seems)
A knight in shining armour on a charger
The stuff of dreams (the stuff of dreams).

Mamma Mia what am I to do?
All these beauties, which one will I choose?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?
I just don't know who it should be  

So, I'll take them home to mama and let her decide for me.
In Spain I met Maria; full of fire
What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser

That made me smile
The English girl was pretty what a pity
She was so shy, I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya

Was free and wild, and I mean wild!
Mama Mia, what a mess I'm in!
Endless choices, where do I begin?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?

Perhaps Suzanne or Emily?
How will I know if she's the girl to love and hold eternally?

And mindful of the anxious thoughts
That find me, surround me and bind me

And rise to speak the goodness of Your name

You will never come at all

I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms
In the arms of my dear Savior

Feel Him Prostate in the garden
On the ground your Maker lies
On the bloody tree, behold him
Sinner, will this not suffice?

Lo, the incarnate God ascended
Pleads the merit of his blood
Venture on him, venture wholly
Let no other trust intrude

I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms

The scent of rain, the weight of clouds pulling down the sky
Sometimes it takes a storm to know how you feel
To understand indigo and the varnished sun lighting up the fields

It takes the rain between the lines to know what sorrow finds

Above the ditches and the cottonwood

A song and a prayer to slow the time

Into the golden afternoon
Much too long, and over soon

This is the moment that lovers part

The long years ending with a sign
And all the anguish, all that time

It may have been love that held them fast 
Or want of love that made it last
Our long arms hanging at our sides

Wasn't it love that made him cry?
And love that seemed to pass him by

Lovely evening
A perfect evening
For a stroll on the town
Couples on the boardwalk
And down on the sandbar
Holding hands, staring out
To the moon on the ocean

Water in motion

Car lights

We look both ways
My baby and me
We find a fancy restaurant
A table outside
In a quiet corner, please
Wind in the palm trees
Candles and wine
Her clear blue eyes
We stay till closing

Come on, my love
We can walk home
Past the dancers
And the bands winding down
Remind me again

In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above
Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.
To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small;
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish—but naught changeth Thee.

Born in the autumn of 1916

A shy, pretty girl from East Texas
Religious and restless
Humble and kind as a person could be

She loved to sing in the choir
Loud and inspired
Her head tilted down, keeping time

Or tell stories with friends after supper
Ignoring the hour
A calico cat fast asleep at her side

And she loved to drive
Her big red car
Though she couldn't see over
The hood very far
She'd back out the driveway
And point that thing down the road
We'd say, Lord, there she goes

Her hair was silver and messy
She walked in a hurry
Worried about wasting the day

Some nights she sat at her dresser
Composing long letters
Falling asleep with a pen in her hand

And she loved to drive
Her big red car
A scarf round her shoulders
Her foot to the floor
Down to the grocery
She'd wave good-bye 
And we'd pray
Lord, bring her back safe.

It seems like you are far from me

A dog begins to bark
The next-door neighbor
Shuts her kitchen blinds
Up on the moonlit rise
Joe-Jack sleeps outside
On an old gunnysack
Filled with soda cans

Out across the lawn
2 cats have their fun

Epi and Lou on the slippery grass
They tumble and jump in a crazy dance
Look up at the stars like they're in a trance
Climb the willow tree

Epi and Louie freeze
They don't blink or breathe

In the atmosphere
Walking down the road
Sniffing as he goes

His eyes are yellow green

Trickster on the prowl
Throws back his head and howls

The night heats up when the coyote comes
He won't rest till his work is done
Critters flee when he comes around
Some won't make it home

Life is never what it seems
Pull me from this waking dream
I should have come inside
So much guilt, so much regret
Don't let my life be over
Let me come inside
I wanna come inside

(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

We don't want war, can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need a antidote and a cure
Coz do you really think Mohamed got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people, just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can't change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Chorus]

Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Chorus]

I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

Fernando Santullo,"Bajo a tomar un café, tropiezo casi caigo y siento que
Por un momento pierdo la fé
Me consuelo pensando que ya no muerdo el anzuelo
Levanto el alma del suelo, prendo un pucho, y salgo de este sucucho
Llevo en la mano el cigarro y pienso ""otro crack con pies de barro""
Mejor jugar de callado y nunca treparse al carro,
Ando emperrado en encontrar el tiempo perdido, en lamentos apretados
En penales casi siempre mal pateados
Laburo por chirolas, no quiero seguir y decido salir de la cola
Y aunque el lobo no puede, y aunque las gambas casi no quieren
Doy una vuelta a ver si todavía llueve

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

El vidrio que me mira, la gente que dobla la esquina
La bocanada casi me tira y la rambla, que sigue vacía
Suelo mojado, el tránsito encajonado
Como un perro que ladra encerrado en una trampa desconocida
La lluvia que salpica la memoria enrojecida por la nostalgia
Como lágrimas partidas, como lágrimas perdidas
Tiempo mejor, cielo de miel
Ahora que sale el sol y empieza a calentar la piel

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

Bronco tosarrón de tanto fumar, ganas de empezar a caminar
Y dejar de pensar en flores que se queman de frío 
En un sucio jarrón vacío 
En un Río de Plata marrón que ahora miro sin apuro

Chiflo bajo, me pateo el hormigón mientras pienso, 
Calentón, que me rajo del laburo y que me rajó con razón

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

Ya no duele el corazón
Ya no duele el corazón

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón

Fernando Ubiergo,"Dicen que el tiempo guarda en las Bastillas
las cosas que el hombre olvidó
lo que nadie escribió,
aquello que la historia presintió
y vuelan las gaviotas a la tierra,
trayendo la vida que han robado al mar
A quién le importará que las gaviotas
vuelen la historia del mar
Guarda el tiempo en las Bastillas
unas cuantas semillas
que entrega una canción
pero hay un lugar donde olvido floreció
Guardan polvos Las Bastillas el tiempo
una semilla, quizás una canción
Pero quién guardará las cosas
que no son de Dios
y buscan las hormigas por la tierra
migar y migas hasta hacer un pan
a quién le importará que las hormigas
miguen su propia verdad
y nace esta canción desde el cemento

y el canto de un zorzal
se perderá en el ruido de

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise

Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,

So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ey yo
Das ist Afrob und Ferris MC

Ey yo das geht raus (ja man)
An alle meine Kopfnicker, Hip Hopper

Yo!
Schönen guten Abend meine Damen und Herren
Wir machen Rapmusik verdammt wir hören sie auch gern
Also herzlich willkommen - (wir rollen mit Hip Hop)
Der Name ist Ferris MC und ich heiße Afrob
(Keine Frage, Mann, nur das Beste vom Besten zum Testen
Arbeit und Schweiß kann Talent nicht ersetzen
Ob heiß wie Feuer, kalt wie Eis, schwarz auf weiß
Du willst'n Beweis? Bezahl den Preis für den Scheiß)
Junge, was wollt ihr mehr? Ich und er rocken schwer
Die anderen Rapper fuckt das ab, habt ihr was? Dann kommt doch her
Aber bitte wer schafft es nur so ungefähr
So wie wir? Mikrofone brennen weil wir Funken spucken
Alter, wir sind nicht wie jeder machen's nicht mit jeder
Besitzen mehr Größenwahn als'n Ami, schwingt bei uns die Feder
Wie das größte Schwert Auf dem höchsten Pferd
Durch die Industrie kommen wir in Frieden wie Ganja oder Gandhi

Ferris was geht ab?
(Ey yo, Afrob was geht ab?)

Komm wir rocken jetzt die Stadt

Afrob und der Ferris ist die richtige Adresse

Unsere Augen haben rotes Licht, stehen immer auf stand by
Alle Leute kommt seid ihr mit?
Afrob, Ferris MC ist der neue Hit
Wir machen's vor ihr macht es nach das ist der erste Schritt
Zusammen rockt die Action spüre diesen Augenblick
(Und unser Überblick wird geschickt rübergeschickt, vergiss den Standard
Scheißrapper stellen Arbeitslosenantrag
Denn wenn wir hier sind seid ihr besser da
Und ihr wisst wer besser ist in diesem wie in jedem Jahr)
Vielleicht ist unser Rapstyle euch viel zu kompliziert
Das ist mir scheißegal, auch wenn ihr uns voll ignoriert
Ich lieb den Scheiß steh dahinter eintausend Prozent
Jeder der mich kennt, weiß ich bin der Rapper der wie Feuer brennt
Und das zeichnet einen guten MC aus
Er versteht sein Werk (und macht das beste draus)
Gar nichts fordert ihn heraus
(Wir haben was zu erledigen, uns hier zu verewigen

Mit blabla noch geiler
Rap ich dir zu weit, bleib' unerreicht für meine Biter

Aus dem Schatten will, ans Sonnenlicht
Ein neues Raplabel über Tracks, wie Trips so dope wie Cannabis
Frisch geworfen, weil mein Hirn ständig schwanger ist
High Quality gibt es gegen Party auf Chris

Das ist mein Geschäft
Ich bin mein eigener Chef
Und pass' in kein Passepartout
Ich bin ich du bist du

Mein Lebenslauf lang, seh nicht anders als die anderen aus
Dein ärgster Traum bleib wach bis du liebst was er hat
Gib nicht an, niemals auf ob bei Tag oder Nacht

Zeitlos für die Ewigkeit
Ich leb' nicht ewig aber ewig breit

Sobald ich's Micro live teste
Wissen meine Gäste: Ferris ist der Beste
Der Rest nur Message, statt lang und langweilig
Leb' ich lieber kurz und heftig
Erst Spaß, dann Vergnügen, auf den Tod wart' ich echt nich'
Das derbste aus dem Untergrund, mein Lebensstil ungesund
Unbrauchbar für den Zivildienst, untauglich für'n Bund
Der Grund ist einfach, Freaks folgen wie Tiere ihrem Instinkt
Asis lügen derbe wenn die Wahrheit nix mehr einbringt
Bin ich 'n Arsch, XXLarge, so fett wie der Sound klingt
Bis jeder hört wie mein Scheiß stinkt
Eingebranntes könntest du mir glauben
An sich weder taubstumm noch blind
Weil ich mit allen Wassern gewaschen worden bin

Ferris MC,"Wir lernten uns beide kennen, als wir ins gleiche Tagesheim kamen
Wir wurden die besten Freunde im Alter von 9 Jahren
Mit 10 war Blutsbrüderschaft angesagt
Wir schworen uns den ganzen Kinderscheiß
Und hielten uns klüger als die gesamte Nachbarschaft

Mein Stiefvater 'n Alkoholiker
Wir hatten immer was zum Saufen
Neugierde war alles, was wir brauchten
Die Umstände machten aus uns das, was wir wurden
Die Pädagogen machten meiner Mutter Sorgen, 
ich sei verzogen und verdorben
Wir glänzten durch Schulschwänzen und dachten nicht an Morgen
Mit 12 wären wir für Theresa Osslowski gestorben
Wir chillten mit den älteren Angebern und Proleten
Meist arbeitsloses Pack, 
mit 'nem verlebtem Erfahrungsschatz

Schaut euch die Leute an, mit denen ihr abhängt
Hat Mutti gepredigt
Sonst hat sich eure Zukunft eher früher, als später erledigt
Unwichtig! Wir wollten wissen, wie Zigaretten mit Hasch schmecken
Wie kann man lautlos Autos auf und in Häuser einbrechen
Für uns war's normal, dass wir immer mehr wollten, was wir nicht durften
Deshalb haben wir uns weniger gefreut, als wir 13 wurden
Wir waren zu zweit und halbstark,
Wir gingen durch dick und dünn und Betonklötze waren unser Freizeitpark

Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Durch dich muss ich erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet
Wir können nicht mehr teilen, was ist und einmal war
Die Erinnerung an dich nehm' ich mit in mein Grab
Wir hätten nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Wir mussten erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet
Wir können nicht mehr teilen, was ist und einmal war
Die Erinnerung an dich nehm' ich mit in mein Grab

Seine Eltern krepierten bei einem Autounfall,
Da war er grad drei
Seit dem wächst er bei Oma auf, die lebt lieber in den Tag hinein
Zu alt um ihm was zu verbieten, zu schwach um ihn anzuschreien
Das bisschen Rente und Kindergeld vom Staat war für zwei viel zu klein
Jede Schwierigkeit schweißt uns zusammen wie siamesische Zwillinge
Zwei Kiddie-Punks, zwei Gesellschaftsunfähige

Was kann man tun, außer Amoksaufen, Fahrradkleber schnüffeln,
Läden beklauen, weil die Bullen nix tun können, wenn sie uns erwischen
Uns kamen Ideen zu Hauf, ohne Respekt vorm Gesetz
Jeder Benz von 'nem Bonz wurd' in Brand gesetzt
Grenzen und Limits sind uns fremd, wir kennen noch keine
Diesen Sommer wollen wir alles ausprobieren und übertreiben
Die Türsteher vor 'ner Disko schenken nur 'nem Ausweis Beachtung,
Die passenden Zahlen stimmen durch Steuermarken von 'ner Kippenpackung
Logisch will man älter sein, wir waren Spätzünder, wild, ungeduldig
Kurz vor 14 und immer noch unschuldig
Wir liebten tanzen in Strobo- und Schwarzlicht,
Pogen bei Punkkonzerten und Saufmusik in Kellerparties
Geld, Essen, Kleidung, es gab nichts, das wir nicht teilten
Niemand konnte dieser Freundschaft das Wasser reichen

Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Durch dich muss ich erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet
Wir können nicht mehr teilen, was ist und einmal war
Die Erinnerung an dich nehm' ich mit in mein Grab
Wir hätten nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Wir mussten erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet
Wir können nicht mehr teilen, was ist und einmal war
Die Erinnerung an dich nehm' ich mit in mein Grab

Ist nicht viel, das übrig blieb
Außer dieses Lied
Wir sind zu weit gegangen, sind so weit gekommen
Und am Ziel wurde uns dafür alles genommen

Der illegale Scheiß rächt sich, wird sogar mir bewusst
Ich frag' mich oft, ob jede Lebensgeschichte so tragisch enden muss
Erst blieb er mit 15 hängen, durch schlechte Noten
Dann blieb er hängen auf schlechten Drogen und erlitt Angstpsychosen
Man sperrte ihn in die Geschlossene, von allein kam er nicht runter
Zerbrachen das Kind in ihm, stopften es voll mit Psychopharmaka
Sein Gesicht aufgequollen, Reaktionen 10-mal langsamer,
Sie rissen alles, was er war komplett auseinander
Die Chemietherapie hat all seine Wahrnehmungen geraubt,
Er ließ sich helfen, es ging nicht voran, deswegen gab er sich auf
Das Fass lief über, als seine Oma an Altersschwäche starb
Tabletten, Therapeut und mein Besuch – das war's, was er besaß
Sie flickten das Desaster halb zusammen und ab in die Freiheit
Er sah mit 18 aus, wie 40, fiel zurück in die Vergangenheit
Er fand keinen Anschluss, er schaffte keinen Schulabschluss
In seinen Augen schien wohl alles ruiniert, frei zum Abschuss
Außer ihm hat's keiner geahnt oder gewusst
Eines Nachts ging er auf die Autobahn, gesteuert von all seinem Frust
'N Tag später durft ich in der Zeitung lesen, was geschah
19 jähriger ließ sich von 'nem Zehntonner überfahr'n

Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es einmal endet
Durch dich muss ich erfahren, dass sich jedes Blatt auch wendet
Wir können nicht mehr teilen, was ist und einmal war
Die Erinnerung an dich nehm' ich mit in mein Grab

Ohne Luft, ohne Licht, nur Kellerfeuchtigkeit
Nein, hier werden sie nicht sehr alt
Also stehen sie auf, rennen ein letztes Mal
Mit Anlauf gegen die Wand
Sie gehen drauf im Abenteuerland
Und ich verliere den Verstand

Ich lass die Feuerwalzen rollen

Ferris MC,"Der Frühling wird endlich seinem Ruf gerecht
Das Eis ist weg, der ganze Dreck
Das grüne und blaue kommen aus ihrem Versteck
Das fade und graue wäscht sich raus, wie ein Fleck
Hab mein gefräßiges Herz an den Nagel gehängt
Die Ketten drum herum hab ich weggesprengt
Hab meine Füße auf den harten Asphalt gestellt
Und meine Flügel, schwer wie Blei, ins Meer versenkt
Ich hab die falschen Freunde vom Hof gejagt
Die Zweifel angeklagt und die Angst vertagt
Die Stunde Null hat begonnen
Aus der Asche entsprung', der Sommer kann kommen

Und wenn ich wieder fall', fall' ich auf Beton
Und wenn es mich nicht umbringt, hab ich Zeit gewonnen
Bin ich nicht da, soll man mich vermissen
Ich steh auf den Stühlen und sitze nicht dazwischen
Ich hatte Glück, denn sie hat mich befreit
Ich bin zurück, endlich zurück
Aus der fensterlosen Zeit
Aus der fensterlosen Zeit

Ich hab mehrmals verloren, um einmal zu gewinnen
Um nach jedem Scheitern wieder neu zu beginnen
Sie hat mich einmal berührt, für immer geheilt
Die alte Haut auf'm Boden verteilt
Ich kann die Augen wieder öffnen, gewöhnen mich ans Licht
Kann jetzt klar sehen, hab jetzt freie Sicht
Ich werd' wie die Drachen vom Himmel steigen
Tausend Geigen sollen mich begleiten
Schlage Wellen, um den Sturm zu entfachen
Lass ihn mit 300 Sachen in die Stadt rein krachen
Ich bin nicht mehr getrieben, ich lass mich treiben
Und wenn ich schon mal da bin, werd' ich auch bleiben

Und wenn ich wieder fall', fall' ich auf Beton
Und wenn es mich nicht umbringt, hab ich Zeit gewonnen
Bin ich nicht da, soll man mich vermissen
Ich steh' auf den Stühlen und sitze nicht dazwischen
Ich hatte Glück, denn sie hat mich befreit
Ich bin zurück, endlich zurück
Aus der fensterlosen Zeit

Wie ein Dieb war ich auf der Flucht vor ihr
Doch sie hat mich gefunden, schon nach wenigen Stunden
In einem fensterlosen Raum kam mir die Zeit abhanden
Wie kalt und ausgebrannt ich war, hab ich lange nicht verstanden
Die Müllabfuhr hätte mich fast eingesackt
Wie ein alter Sack, der nichts mehr von alleine packt
Doch eine Stimme hat gesagt, es ist zu früh um aufzugeben
Meine Zeit sei gekommen, um es anzunehmen, dieses Leben

Und wenn ich wieder fall', fall' ich auf Beton
Und wenn es mich nicht umbringt, hab ich Zeit gewonnen
Bin ich nicht da, soll man mich vermissen
Ich steh' auf den Stühlen und sitze nicht dazwischen
Ich hatte Glück, denn sie hat mich befreit
Ich bin zurück, endlich zurück

Ferris MC,"Der Kater kommt aus den Katakomben
Er lauert überall Hamburg, New York, London
Er holt sich alle ran, die Braunen und die Blonden
Und alle, die die Finger nicht vom Gift lassen konnten

Er schleicht sich an auf leisen Pfoten unbemerkt
Und das, was andere schwächt, ist das, was ihn bestärkt
Eine Nacht im Rausch, viel zu wenig Schlaf
Rate mal, wer ihn am nächsten Morgen streicheln darf

Heute nehmen wir es nicht so genau
Denn es ist Nacht und alle Katzen sind grau
Sie singen ""Miau, miau, miau""
Bis der Kater kommt, bis der Kater kommt

Morgen früh zeigt das erste Licht
Sie sind noch ein bisschen grau im Gesicht
Der Kopf macht au, au, au
Wenn der Kater kommt, wenn der Kater kommt

Er braucht das Licht nicht, er kann im Dunkeln sehen
Wie sie am Wochenende alle ihre Runden drehen
All die Katzen wissen, morgen wird es unbequem
Wenn die Stunden dieser Nacht vor die Hunde gehen

Aus der Gosse bis zum höchsten Kratzbaum
Von der High Society bis hin zum letzten Abschaum
Keiner hält ihn auf - ihr könnt machen, was ihr wollt
Er lässt sich nicht bestechen, auch nicht mit Katzengold

Ferron,"I watch you reading a book
I get to thinking our love's a polished stone
You give me a long drawn look
I know pretty soon you're going to leave our home
And of course I mind,
Especially when I'm thinking from my heart
But life don't clickety clack down a straight line track
It comes together and it comes apart.
You say you hope I'm not the kind
To make you feel obliged
To go ticking through your time
With a pained look in your eyes
You give me the furniture, we'll divide the photographs
Go out to dinner one more time
Have ourselves a bottle of wine
And a couple of laughs
And when first you left
I stayed so sad I wouldn't sleep
I know that love's a gift, I thought yours was mine
And something that I could keep
Now I realize that time is not the only compromise
But a bird in the hand could be an all night stand
Between a blazing fire and a pocket of skies
So I hope I'm not the kind
To make you feel obliged
To go ticking through your time
With a pained look in your eyes
I covered the furniture, I framed the photographs
Went out to dinner one more time
Had myself a bottle of wine and a couple of laughs
And just the other day
I got your letter in the mail
I'm happy for you, its been so long
You've been wanting a cabin and a backwoods trail
And I think that's great...me...
I seem to find myself in school
It's all Ok, I just want to say
I'm so relieved we didn't do it cruel
But ain't life a brook
Just when I get to feeling like a polished stone
I give me along drawn look
It's kind of a drag to find yourself alone
And sometimes I mind
Especially when I'm waiting on your heart
But life don't clickety clack down a straight line track
It comes together and it comes apart.
Cause I know you're not the kind
To make me feel obliged
To go ticking through my time with a pained look
In my eyes
I sold the furniture, I put away the photographs
Went out to dinner one more time
Skipped the bottle of wine
Had a couple of laughs
And wasn't it fine....",Ain't Life a Brook,1980
Ferron,"It's a quiet street in someone's town
On stranger's feet I mark my ground
I trace my circles round and round
I'm sworn to find me
In a party scene and I'd just got loose
Its my devil's luck to be introduced
To one who takes their shape like you
It unbinds me

We knew we wouIdn't have everything
And time proves it true
I've got a flat-top six dressed in steel strings
And I don't have you
You wouIdn't like the life
And I wouIdn't want you to

There's a secret in this solitude
As my love unfolds I find it's often crude
I call you late and my words intrude
And I falter
But the miles don't shrink by telephone
The crackling wire becomes our home
I tell you I'm okay alone
And then I wonder
I've got towns ahead
And shows behind
And I won't be lost

I join my name to that solid line
Though it always costs
But it takes my time
And it fills my mind
And it feeds the ghost of
Memories in the quiet heat
When our words were trim
And our hope was neat
We said our purpose here
Was to be complete with 'I want you'
It's a woman's dream this autonomy
Where the lines connect
And the points stay free
We said passion as an open sea
Would only haunt you
I watch the last cab
Turn its headlights down
To today's sunrise
I must have wanted you in every town
And it's no surprise
That want alone don't sit you down
By my love eyes
I've got memories in the quiet heat

Ferron,"They said some men would be warriors and some men would be kings
And some men would be owners of land and other man-made things
And false love as the eternal flame would move some to think in
rings
And gold would be our power and other foolish things
But you who dream of liberty must not yourselves be fooled
Before you get to plea for freedom, you've agreed to being ruled
If the body stays a shackle then the mind remains a chain
That'll link you to a destiny whereby all good souls are slain
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all
It won't take long, and you may say
""What has that got to do with me"" and I say,
""You mean to tell me that's all?""
Of three men in a desert wandering, one is knowing and two are
scared
They say time is in the river, but the river is not there
Dry in spirit dry in body two will lend themselves to death
And in grief one weeps into his hands and drinks his bitter
tears
'Cause it don't take long, it don't take too long at all
It don't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know what you're talking about,"" and I say
""You mean to tell me that's all?""
And as I stand before you now, I am hopeful in my rage
You know love has finally called for me, I will not wilt upon
its stage
But still smaller than my nightmare now do I print upon the page
Do we have to live inside its walls to identify the cage?
'Cause it takes so long, why does it take so long,
But it takes so long, and you may say,
""I don't really care what you're talking about,"" and I say,
""Are you trying to say you don't belong?""
I am my mother's daughter, but I have seen myself in you
It's this blessing that I follow now, and so I must speak true
I dreamed of thousands dying, it was you and you and you,
And while the city sleeps so quietly there is something we must
do
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know if I want to know what you're getting at,""
And it makes we want to say, ""So long.""
Because grief will come in measures, only grief alone will know
And you'll see it on your family, on your own face it will grow
And they'll try to keep you hungry, then they'll tell you to eat
snow
You know pride can be a moving thing if we learn the strength of
""NO!""
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't think this has anything to do with me,""
""But did you ever think you could be wrong?""
At noon on one day coming, human strength will fill the streets
Of every city on our planet, hear the sound of angry feet
With business freezed up in the harbour, the kings will pull
upon their
hair
And the banks will shudder to a halt, and the artists will be
there
'Cause it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't think I can be a part of that,"" and it makes me want to
say,
""Don't you want to see yourself that strong?""
Division between the peoples will disappear that honoured day
And though oceans lie between us, lifted candles light the way
Half will join their hands by moonlight, the rest under a rising
sun
As underneath the sun and moon, a ritual'd wailing has begun
And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all,
It won't take long, and you may say,
""I don't know how to be a part of what you're talking about,""
and it makes
me want to say, ""Come on!""
And beware you sagging diplomats, for you will not hear one gun
And though our homes be torn and ransacked we will not be undone
For as we let ourselves be bought, we're going to let ourselves
be free
And if you think we stand alone, look again and you will see:
We are children in the rafters, we are babies in the park,
We are lovers at the movies, we are candles in the dark,
We are changes in the weather, we are snowflakes in July,
We are women grown together, we are men who easily cry,
We are words not quickly spoken, we're the deeper side of try,
We are dreamers in the making, we are not afraid of ""Why?""",It Won't Take Long,1984
Ferron,"I can't call you from this place
to hear you say that I'm not your kind
It's a thin road before us, we're the wake left behind
It's sad and I fail to see what it had to do with you
and me
But I guess that's like wondering what's a point to a
line
There must be something I wanted more than wanting your
love
'cause you stood in my doorway and I stood in my glove
Most afraid to follow, a kingdom my stride
It's so telling what won't live with hunger and pride.

I thought of you often but I never could tell you
the 'you' that I cherished, something hurt me so bad
A few had come close, I couldn't take them in either
I guess the distance between us was my love never had.
And though we live separate I keep two rooms open
One has you in it, the other does not
And I move in the middle, unsure and protected
And I trip on my rope, vaguely sensing I'm caught.

A friend tried to find me and saw through to my wheel
She said you're now on the bottom, it's either that or
the top
You can keep yourself tiny and bang on the big door
Or take the space saved for the queen of the hop
But you know queens have their problems too,
and my size won't stay static
I like to think I never was one for the hoop anyway
And then that night I dreamed again of the far side of
nothing
And trembling with terror I chose to come back this
way.

In the streets or the 'after,' in the churches or in
memory,
The light that will guide you is the source of the
flame
While stumbling the back alleys in search of right
action
I fell and wept darkly and acknowledged your name
And the door to my prison dissolved right before me
But like a young fool I quick looked for a power to
claim
And my wailing increased with the shock of the
knowledge
That I often have needed something out there to blame.

I give up my fisted touch, my thoughts strong like
fences
My totem-pole stature, body chipped to the bone
I'm nobody's saviour, and nobody's mine either
I hear the desert wind whisper ""But neither are we
alone.""
Sure I long to ask how you're doing, if you got to the
lightness
That you wanted so fiercely when we drifted that way
There's no telephones ringing now, but I feel something
calling me
And I'm ready to go, I just need time to say
Hearts are like meadows, with their weathered potential
With their reasons diluted by reason itself
I may be shivering at the foot of this slow-giving
mountain
But the tiny spring flowers can look just like you
And I won't ask the purpose of all of my footsteps
And I won't let my eyelids cast down
I am looking for something outside of forgiveness
You might call it the jewel of the crown.",Proud Crowd/Pride Cried,1984

That for a moment I should see
In that darkness was I weeping
In that silence sadly free
Now I'm waiting in your valley
To be standing on your mountain
That I might tumble down your hillside
To a place that waits for me.

From a time I dare to mention
I was shown the broken line
In this world of good intentions
The cruelest love can seem so kind
And you may harbor quiet sorrow
But to speak it is the crime

To be standing on your mountain
That I might tumble down your hillside
To a place that waits for me.

I have asked so many people
What the spark of life might be
But they bade me not to ask for
More than the muted heart could be

",Dear Marly,1992
Ferron,"After Sally came, it's like we fell apart... no more hands in pockets and whispered, denim doorway talks at night. Love was just a game that lonely tourists played, and we'd weave in and out of their dreams unfettered. 

But now when she stares you down, you're just like a small shoe lost at sea and until a strong wind blows you round, it's better not to think about you and me, but if there's anything else I can do... why don't you call me...

It's so easy to laugh with strangers who say they've gone sick on love enough. It's harder to tell each other our deepest, secret stuff. There'll always be gorgeous babes around...it's the nature of towns at midnight...liquid, our promises to reach for pleasure and never to fall down. 

But now when she touches you, you're just like a fire got outta hand and until the facts shine through it might be better if we just don't make a plan. But if there's anything else I can do...


...Someone's been walking by your lane at night. Someone's been calling out your name so light---come out, come out---someone's been hoping that maybe you'd catch their light...but there's no sign from you, no sign, so maybe it's true that...


...when she pulls you down, you're just like a skip on ship-to-shore. Until the tide turns 'round I guess it's better just to say we both want more, but should there be anything else I can do baby...call me.
",Call Me,1994
Ferron,"First comes the kiss
Then comes the hands too hot to touch
Feeling like this
I want to be with you so much
Driving to work in the morning
Everyone's house looks warm inside
I can't believe what I'm thinking
I've got to be out of my mind
When you give me a cactus flower
I figure you're telling me how it is
We make love, it's a cosmic shower
And I ask you, are we friends too
I talk to my sister about it all
To see what she did when she was here
She tells me don't give up your freedom
Which goes to show freedom is not so clear
I'm alive in my center
And true to the core is (in) how I feel
(And) I don't believe I have entered
The place she says where (when) nothing's real
You give me a heart shaped box
I give you a crackerjack ring
You say here I come ready or not
And I say I'd do anything for you
I call up my old friends to tell them
Any excuse to say your name
Finally I'm touched and I'm open
Fear and elation now feel the same
More and more often
I wave off friends to stay alone
The life of the party is nothing
Compared to the mystery that waits at home
When you give me a brown care bear
I give you a miniature moving van
When you tell me that brown bear cares
I say yes we can, yes we can
( Every move you never made
Every word you could not say
Every cry you cried alone
Can remain with us instead.

And a fish for every sea
And everything that's in between
Is where it is
Is what it is )",Alice Says Yes,1996
Ferron,"I'd think of all those people with their love and understanding
How they wear it like they had it from the start
I must have been the other kind...
the kind with just a lonely mind and heart
And from where you stand you're an attractive revelation
And from where I stand I'm mostly on my knees
And from there I said hello, felt something small and slow
Say ""Please, please, please""
And though it's just a thought, It's such a saving shot...
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among the broken ones.
I remember crying down a long and withered highway
I remember waiting for my story to begin.
Had all my laughs cut short, a boat without a port
A ragged house of tin.
But ... maybe it's true about the teacher when you're ready
Maybe it's true about the hollow and the slope
Love, turn my steps around
Let me fall on solid ground with Faith and rope.
And though its just a thought, I say it's all I've got...
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among
the broken ones.
Outside a window there's a night beyond all secrets
And outside that window there's a window shining in
And it shows a room that has a fire steady burning
And a woman knowing that the darkness can't come in
And she wants to thank you for your love and understanding
She needs to thank you for your honour to the soul
It's love from someone who believed she'd need a stand in
To tell her story let alone to live it whole
And though it's just a thought, she says it's all we've got
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among

in the light of your day
Be easy with friends
Be easy with laughter
and you'll keep it away
Through your long night
and through all your pain
the Spirit Doctor say
you know, you're gonna be alright
and when you're better
you're gonna do it all again
Through your long night
and through all your pain
the Spirit Doctor say
you know, your'e gonna be alright
and when your'e better
oh, you do it all again
So be easy with words
Be easy with feelings
when they almost care
when you're almost there
Go easy....
All that marks the power
and the brilliance of our love
Is traces in a moonlit night
of a high suspended dove
.and the path it flew, with its aim so true
And its wings in sure formation
showed a way we could not know
would fill us with elation
STILL RIOT

STILL RIOT",Easy With Love,1996
Ferron,"I am hungry how are you?
You say that every lie came true
I will hold you anyway
And you'll grow strong and leave one day
Is there any other way?
Look desire in its face
Watch it eat and leave no trace
After you have disappeared
Who will know and who will hear?
Oh it's such delicious fear.
Brushes with a starving hand
Just the ache I understand
After you have swallowed me
Who do you think you will be?
You'll be you and I'll be me.
And still I will lay my body down
And in your many voices drown
Oh we are a hidden pool
We are so long we are so cool
While underneath we're dark and cruel
And I am hungry how are you?
You say that every lie came true
I will hold you anyway
And you'll grow strong and leave one day
Is there any more to say?
But : take the front door leave just one
And don't return there are no chances pending
If you want to live this way
Only those like you will play
And they never play to stay.
And they never play to stay.
And they never play to stay...they never play to stay...",I Am Hungry,1996
Ferron,"Every person has their story, the one they vamp
And revamp
There is a way through constant sorrow
But we must do more than light the lamp

Unlike Zhivago at the window Pining Lara's love
We dare not wait the weather to join the
High suspended dove
Cause yesterday my baby girl walked up to a little boy
And I watched her curl her arms around him
And transform her fear to joy

And if I believe we've blown our purpose
Then I might have missed the chance
To see Gandhi in two babies bodies
And watch them spin and dance

You gotta go for fire
You gotta go for what you know so well
You gotta go for why you came this way
And Live your story tall and well

Maybe you can't believe somehow
That things can turn around
All your life it just seemed like some were destined upward
And some were destined down

And it's just not gonna be that simple for us
Cause it's not so hard to see
That's it's a huge and limitless sky describing what will be
And there might be a disillusioning calm
In the winds that blow

But believe that changes come
Keep your dream, knowing dreams come slow
And beat your drum for those before you
And for those eager on the side
And light a candle for life's still and riotous dream to
Dwell where love abides

You gotta go for the mystery
You gotta go for the high true flight
To deny the grace in tragedy
Is to deny the beauty in the owl's lonesome night
You gotta go for fire

You gotta go for what you know so well
You gotta go for why you came this way
And live your story cell to cell to cell
If we're in everything we think, and everything we do

Then I am in you and you're in me
And only Nothing is as true
There is a way through constant sorrow
There is a way through constant sorrow
There is a way through constant sorrow",Primitive Future,1996
Ferron,"The night before the day we meet
I make my walk on sacred ground
I turn my eyes up to most soulful sky
And in evening soil my heels sink down
I hear people laughing together down the way
And as their glasses tinkle in their play
I'm in between the moon and tomorrows light
And I cannot know how close you are.
The beast and baby have to meet
Until they do, they cry, they cry alone
The moon must line up with the sun
And burn the path that lights us home
I've seen your face a thousand times
And I've heard your voice in everything
And but I've always known
That love would be a simple song that I would sing
And as I wait I sing this song to you
And to a hollow moon like a golden ring
And to a tree that stands solo in an opening
The night before the day we meet.
And the beast and baby have to meet
Until they do they cry, and they cry alone
And the moon must line up with the sun
And burn the path that lights us home
I've seen your face a thousand times
And I heard your voice in everything
And I've always known that love would be
The simple song that I would sing
The night before the day you come
I hear signals and messages from anyone
And I want to bring my head down and kiss someone
I have all my human senses...now, can I calm my senses?
Can I calm my freedom ?
Can I calm my sense of freedom?",Signals and Messages,1996
Ferron,"Sadie's momma was a tanker always bowling her
down to the ground
And when Sadie got old enough she moved it on
Her freedom was a one way bus to another town
She had a little money, bought a dress and she put it on
And she worked her days in an all night restaurant
It was called believe or not...Anything You Want
There was a woman on the graveyard shift that
Sadie liked a lot
And she even took to coming early just in case
they could have some time
It seemed that anything the graveyard lady wanted
the graveyard lady got
And Sadie decided the difference between them
was a shadow line
Years would fly before she'd bother to try
to be her own true face
Right now seemed like every thing was sadly stuck in place
Hot town, Toronto, l951
The Spring is doing its stuff
She sends a letter home to say ""I've come undone""
All they say ""that's tough""
Another birthday pass her by and she has a dream
one night that she can fly
And she goes to work that day and all she does is cry cry cry
And Sadie finally meet a man who dances a jig
and she follows him down
But don't he turn out to be a little angel of misery
Living quiet in a private dream, protected by a frozen frown
Periodically he looks up and says
""Sadie, what's to become of you and me?""
It's at these times that she holds his head
Half wishing all the while that he's holding her instead
And she finally tells him that and it blows his mind...
Takes a little time, takes a little time, takes a little
   time.
Takes a little time, takes a little time, takes a little
   time.
It's so amazing what you don't find out
when you're dancing!!",Takes a Little Time (Intro),1996
Ferron,"She told me about a silver lake tucked tight
Behind a rock face
Your basic demons tell you fools come late
I had my reasons but they left me in the night

Where the quiet meets the cracking of a heartbreak
Some mountains you can wander in the night
And some mountains you're not supposed to know
It's like...some people got their wild wild hearts

And some others bide their time until they meet them
When co ordinates are disappearing stars
Maps can't help you can't believe them
You need good vision, clear water in your flask

And time to feel the surging of your heart beat
Your best companion is the one who's gonna ask about
Your soul-lined connection to your foolish feet
Some mountains you can wander in the dark

Some moments are a circus in the park
I've met the desert with its hot dry wind
I know pain...I get enough through predilection
A hundred people want to tell you where they've been

A hundred others want to go in that direction
I long to say I actually made it to the top
And gazed out across that glassy water
I wasted nights with dreams of kisses so hot

Course the ending was same as if I'd gone without her

I want to move on but history is hard in me still
I'm trapped in the loop still I give us a chance

Spendin' my time waitin' for your heart to find a moment that is mine
I'm countin' on time to bring your love back to me
Don't let it pass you by

Ferry Corsten,"Now I'm away from you, and you're away from me
Only I feel you here, can make it like it was
Your heart in my ear, where I placed my head for years
How can I be one
Without my heart
Without my heart

No one can be a part of me
Have all the love inside of me
Now I live to dream that you're here by my side
No one can be a part of me
Have all the love inside of me
Now I live to dream that you're here by my side

Do you know that I'm strong? And I will carry on
But where in my heart, on the skin of my bones
You want me to be loved to another while you're gone
But no one here will do, there's nobody like you
There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you

No one can be a part of me
Have all the love inside of me
Now I live to dream that you're here by my side
No one can be a part of me
Have all the love inside of me
Now I live to dream that you're here by my side

No one can be a part of me
Have all the love inside of me
Now I live to dream that you're here by my side

And moonlight fading as you walk away.
And all the roads that lead me to your heart
Have gone astray

My hands are tied behind my back,
And I'm weakened by, your slow attack,
You take me in, then change your mind again.

Your spinning wheel won't lead me to your view,
And all the words I need to hear from you,
I'm holding on but guess I'm out of luck,
And still in love with you

My hands are tied behind my back,
And I'm weakened by, your slow attack,
You take me in, then change your mind again.

Hold my face, in your hands, look into my eyes
So understand, all the thoughts, inside your mind
Tell me it's time

My hands are tied behind my back,
And I'm weakened by, your slow attack,
You take me in, then change your mind again.
You take me in, then change your mind again.",Holdin' On [Album Version],2005

Ferry Corsten,"Diamonds are forever.
But passion is better.
And cold hard cash can't save a sinner's soul.
Springtime in Paris. 
Is reckless and careless
But life is more than just a fashion show

And somewhere in the distance
Is a voice I recognize.
A boy I had forgotten 'till tonight
You give me reason to live
You give me all of what is
You make it hard to deny
That I'm falling down on love
Down on love

You lose it you find it
Like a wristwatch you wind it
You got so absent minded
That you almost lose yourself

And somewhere in the distance
Is a voice I recognize.
A boy I had forgotten 'till tonight
You give me reason to live
You give me all of what is
You make it hard to deny
That I'm falling down on love
Down on love

And somewhere in te distance
Is a voice I recognize.
