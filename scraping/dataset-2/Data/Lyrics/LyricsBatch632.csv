Lucy Pearl,"I can't, can't stand your mother 
She's just so much in our business 
And I can't really deal with it 
I can't, can't stand your mother 
Try to have you as a friend 
But you've got to understand 

[Raphael]
I used to love when 
Christmas time came around 
But now all I do is frown (frown, frown, frown) 
I can't even talk to you on my own 
Believe it or not (whispher) 
And I can't even use my own damn phone 
That why I can't stand your mama babe 

I can't, can't stand your mother 
She's just so much in our business 
And I can't really deal with it 
I can't, can't stand your mother 
Try to have you as a friend 
But you've got to understand 

[Dawne]
I didn't really want to to go there (go there) 
But your mama's in my head 
In the closet 
In the bedroom 
Saying things that I can't bear 
Telling me how I should live 
Tell me how to raise my kid 
Always want to borrow money 
Got the nerve to act so funny 
You better deal with her 
Or you'll be living with her 
'Cause I, cause I 

I can't, can't stand your mother 
She's just so much in our business 
And I can't really deal with it 
I can't, can't stand your mother 
Try to have you as a friend 
But you've got to understand 

[Raphael]
Girl, your mama's wrong 
Living with her daughter 
When her ass is grown 
Thought we were supposed 
To be alone 
All I want to do is wear 
My own cologne 
Well, well 

[Dawne]
Your mama's just as bad 
Needs to mind her business 
With her nosy ass 
Showing up uninvited 
She ain't go no class 
Complaining, always hating 
About the things we have 
Can't deal with that 

[Repeat] 
I can't, can't stand your mother 
She's just so much in our business 
And I can't really deal with it 
I can't, can't stand your mother 
Try to have you as a friend 
But you've got to understand 

I can't, can't stand your mother 
She's just so much in our business 
And I can't really deal with it 
I can't, can't stand your mother 
Try to have you as a friend 
But you've got to understand 

[Dawne]
I'm through with you 
And your mama too 
Get your walking shoes 
Get to stepping fool 
'Cause I'm through with you 
So, through with you 
And your mama too 
Get your walking shoes 
Get to stepping fool 
'Cause I'm through with you 

I can't, can't stand your mother

You should have took his advice
And left the man alone

Lucy Pearl,"Yes I'm coming over now
I've been waiting all day long
I feel like you know what's going on
You've always given me some greater times
Here's my only one request
Don't ever stop giving me your best
Ever day, every day, every day, every day
Is a better day
That's when you come around my way
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Is a better night
That's when we get time to play
Every night I want to play with you
You have me under lock and key
Well this is where I want to be now
Tonight I'm giving you the best of me
I promise I will not hold back
You can count on me to bring it on
Ever day, every day, every day, every day
Is a better day
That's when you come around my way
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Is a better night
That's when we get time to play
Every day is a better day
Every day's a special day
You and me we both make it that way
Every night's a better night
That's why, that's why
I love to say that every day
Ever day, every day, every day, every day
Is a better day

Don't let go
Ask of you, hold on

Hold on

Kissing you is not enough for me
You see I'm a big boy and big boys have desires
Making love is what I wanna do
But I need a true friend to make it come together

All your love
I wanna kiss you right there
Just stand right there lil' girl

All your love
I don't wanna kiss you right there
Just stand right there

I'm not trying to put you on the line
But I gotta tell you what's exactly on my mind girl
My big heart leads me right to you
Every time the phone ring, I pray to God that it's you, girl

Every time I close my eyes
A vision of your face always pops into my mind girl
I would do anything to receive love from you
So take me by the hand and lead me to the room, yeah

Don't let go

Hold your love

Don't let go

Lucy Pearl,"I was walking down the street 
Looking at my feet 
I didn't have no shoes 
On the way to school 

Looking at the fool 
And everybody knew 
But it was all right 
'Cause my friends of mine 

Knew I had a guitar 
They knew I would play 
Become a big star 
And I would go so far 

Remember the times 
When I didn't have a dime 
We remember the times 
When I didn't have a dime 

Those were the best days 
Going down the street playing at the mall 
On the cheap bikes 
Looking for somebody to steel 

Somebody to rob and somebody to fight 
I didn't know my name as well 
As I knew my friends 
But I knew we were so cool 

Everybody wanted to play by their own rules 
We didn't go to school 
Remember the time 
When I didn't have a dime 

I remember the times 
When I didn't have a dime 
Those were the best days 
By the times I was 14 or 15 

Trying to pass my driving test 
The thing to do was to drive to school 
'Cause I could never win for best dressed 
I drove a raggedy car 

To sneaking to the bars 
Young boy life has no stress 
Watching cartoon 
And popping balloons 

That was the best 
Remember the times 
When I didn't have a dime 
I remember the times 

When I didn't have a dime 
Those were the best days",Remember the Times,2000
Lucy Pearl,"There's no need to hate on us so hard
You can't stand the fact that we're so smart
We got the hell off the train before it ran off the track
Got up on this Lucy thing and we never looked back

They can't handle us
'cause they can't step on us
And they can't use us up no more
They tried to funk with us
But they can't put a stop to us
'cause they can't control us no more

That was such an evil game you played
But your mouth wrote a check that your ass is still payin today
'cause it blew up in your face
And now you gotta reap what you sowed
Lies and deceit will kill your mind and eat away at your soul

They can't handle us
'cause they can't step on us
And they can't use us up no more

I couldn't, even swallow

But everything was fine so I'd be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in
That's when the snoopin' and shit it would begin

Where you going?

Or the renaissance how does it do?

Can stress out your brain

But the spell of love
I couldn't shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else
It was your lover
You gave me up
And managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turn to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doin' love
Get it? these things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
Its never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doin' so much to try to pin me
Goin' through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seekin'
Well it seem I'm gettin' close
That I'm reachin'
And I was thinkin' I had no reason
Callin' you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?

We can ascend if your committed

If it goes for many days

But when you're his bride
You can sit or ride
You'll never have to walk!

Unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper

Why won't it fit?

Darling, be still
Cut off a bit of the heel and it will

In the palm of your hand, happily speechless
You wear my shirt and just a devil smile
Bringing Mars closer to Venus
Late that night, I watch you sleep
You saved my life, when no one believed
You gave up Diamonds for a Rolling' Stone
Now I know what it means to be home.

You come and get me out when I'm dizzy in the haze
I'm having no doubts, so proud, I shout it all around it's you babe
You turn my wall around, you quiet underestimate the height of my flight

Slap me pinch me, tell me it's not a dream now
Soak me trench me in honey and cream

Had rolled along the unbroken song

Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Now where are you going and what do you wish?
The old moon asked the three
Well, we're going out fishing for herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

And some silver and gold have we
Said, Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

While the little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we

So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea

But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea

Melt off all my make-up

Este es el juego de seducción

Estamos solos en la selva
Nadie puede venir a rescatarnos
Estoy muriéndome de sed
Y es tu propia piel
La que me hace sentir este infierno

Te llevaré, abrázame
Este es el juego de seducción

Te llevaré hasta el extremo
Te llevaré, abrázame
Este es el juego de seducción

Me haces mover el extremo

Te llevaré hasta el extremo
Te llevaré, abrázame
Este es el juego

Te llevaré hasta el extremo
Te llevaré, abrázame
Abrázame, este es el juego de seducción",Juego de Seducción,2003

I do it for hip hop
I do it for hip hop

[Ludacris]
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screems with emotion
This my daily devotion, the verses stay deaper then the ocean
So hip hop you owe me a promotion
Yea I do a little boasting and bragging
Whats all the commotion and nagging about?
Cuz Im Still the Champ in the south
Cuz rappers get in the booth and I keep dragging them out
For they fire at these pink slips im handing them out
Cuz this is theatre of the mind
Considerate a sign of whats to come next
My moneys just fine bank filled with dumb checks
Terrorist threat flow, proceed to drop bombs like mr.pump flex
But I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart
I do it with the beatbox, I did it from the start
I do it for the DJ's, I do it for the chart's
The fan gel flow,luda do it cuz it's art
I do it for the fans, I do it on command
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block
It's Nine Years old, I did it for HIP HOP!

[Chorus]
I don't do it for the cars and the fancy drops
I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP...
And I don't do it for the chains and the flashing rocks
I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP...

[K-Atomic]
I do it for HIP HOP and never ever stop
Till I get copped, popped, or arrested and locked up
Not for the lowrider with the chrome T-Top
Not for the money that can cop any shop
Not for any Hot Mamas, But nonstop change like obama
No need for drama yo I do it for my soul
To hold and control what I can and thats the goal
To puncture a hole in the bag and leak the movement
Improvement thats the destination, provin the obligation
Chainging the population, making the situation
Better now then ever, n' vow to educating
The hood to good choices and getting a place in
Society with the things we facing, while they hating
We racing to like the masons all the way to the top
Cleaning up the game from the same damn thing
Cats faking and acting lame just to attract fame
But lyrically we react and blast them with words not gats
We (w)rap words around them like an island on a map
[removed]As I put on my fitted cap, I think about the music
And why we do it and how we do use it
To be a nuisance to the common mind
And it's time for the whole world to see me with a blinding shine[/removed]
And I'll never flop or fake with any of them props
Cuz I don't do it for nothing other then HIP HOP!

[Chorus]
I don't do it for the cars and the fancy drops
I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP...
And I don't do it for the chains and the flashing rocks
I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP... I do it for HIP HOP...",I Do It for Hip Hop,

She makes her own money, pays her own bills, always stat fly, keeps it so real, 
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl behind closed doors she a nasty girl. 
She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass, walks so proper, talks with such class, 
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl.

I met this girl named Keysha, she was so sweet
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, make her just right
Never too much, never too little
Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night
All for a man, all 'cause she bought it
All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birth place, know about the streets
Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets 
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed

[Chorus]

I got a college girl go to church every Sunday
Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me
But she so innocent, when she when she around her mommy
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work every mornin'
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise

[Chorus]

I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again

[Luda:] Back up on dat ass ,
Back to put rappers on one knee like they bout to run 100 meter dash,
Bow down to greatness, before I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers,
Covered all my bases, straight, no chasers,
Diamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glacers,
Titanic flow, Titanic dough, women on my nuts like ""Where da Titanic go?""
I been scourin' da earth, makin' my fans catch da holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church,
And the fat lady singin', it's ova for you rappers,
Cant none of yall bust your just sacs full of semen,
And I got da women screamin', and they could catch my balls on any given Sunday like my name's Willy Beaman,
Or LL Cool, so if ya boyfriend thinks your loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool,
Got jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist
Iconic status and his name is Ludacris,
Bitch please, you messin wit some real O.G's,
Wit million dolla whips dat I ship from overseas,
Got a pocket full of G'z, and the inconvenient truth is that the ozone is back cuz I been smokin' all da trees,
The globe is warmin' up when we fire up the blunt,
And put it in the air like Evil Knievel stunts,
Wat you want from me? I got pistols for da haters,
Ya fam will be in black like the playin' for da Raiders,
And ya music isn't favored, and DJ's they neva bring it back like when you go and borrow somethin' from ya neighbor,

And if you sittin on chrome, I'll call up my boys and have you stripped of ya medals like Marion Jones, nigga ...

All this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up

But some bitches just really don't give a fuck

Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda
Always got a drink
And I'm steady smoking buddah

I'ma sit you down
Then take it to the mental and essential and clown
Every chance I get
Bitch I'm hit
Not by no bullet or no pellet 
But the smoke from the can a beer shit
I might just be too high
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again
So when I get old I'ma rock, roll, shake, and shiver
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver

Hey yo I do this for bluntheads and whinos 
Steward Ave. Homes
Niggas from G-Ro committed to slanging blow
Doublin' dough 24-7

Running wit 2 strike felons
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron
Then'll smoke a L

And dare ya to tell
Walk up in the club
Pretty thug
Fucked up off head shots
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's hot
Shaking tits and twats
Placing big face 20's and cock
Loading clips and glocks
Knowing we got the haters hot
The ballin' don't stop
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs
Live it up young nigga cause it's gon' catch up

Now wit the help of Hen and Coke
I grab my pen and pad and wrote
Something that I knew was dope
And represent for my kinfolk
Pimp a hoe until she broke
Wit mo lines than chopped coke
Hey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretto
My shit even come out better
Grab a blunt put it together
What a nigga really need
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker til he
bleed
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out
Or the club get closed out
If it's hoes out I show out
Call Tyheed get Dro'd out
There's no doubt I love my life
Love the light
Love to write
Love the mic

I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
Did I do that or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

On to 7 AK 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

So don't start the fucking game

I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryin' to stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearst
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain

But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

I got one motto get dough till your gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me

I hate it when it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch!

I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical FOOL
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
No holds barred but obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anyone like ya (Hell no!)
I treat humans like students (Fail y'all)
So turn ya books to page 69 and start sucking
When Organized drop the tracks then start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed start fucking
You wanna be starting something Get out the booth 
And lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's
Save all the H20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean
Light skinded nigga turn red but get green
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans

[Chorus]

Boy you done lost yo' mind
No I've lost my virginity
And I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy
What's the remedy Hennessey Coke
If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and things
And watch for impostors that's been in the game
We invented the game and y'all just got hip
(Man what's that smell) Probably your upper lip!
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
Chilling in the gut with no trace of Tom Hanks
So put this in yo' jaw like wieners and beef franks

[Chorus]

I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Did you know that?  Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames
Rearrange, same broad different night
Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
The highlight's that I live a high ass life

You ho who you are
There's hoes in the room, there's hoes in the car
There's hoes on stage, there's hoes by the bar
Hos by near, an hos by far
Ho! (But can I get a ride?)
NO! (C'mon, nigga why?)
Cause you'sa

You gotta run in your pantyhose
Even your daddy knows
That you sucking down chocolate like daddy-o's
You hos are horrible, horrendous
On taxes y'all writing off hos as dependents
I see the ho rising
It ain't surprising
Its just a ho-asis
With ugly chicks faces
But hos don't feel so sad and blue
Cause most of us niggas is hos too

Good luck, time to get hood stuck
Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got the hook up
You know what I did
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass
And fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you whipping yo chin
And I don't blame you
I lay in the sand, y'all lay in the snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider

[Chorus]

Get back, time to get hood jacked
Gold chain, took that
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what you look at
cause you looking to long
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm getting nutt while I'm singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party 
while y'all hitting th bong
But y'all be hitting my schlong
you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh no, you suckers didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull the gold actor
Get slapped up
Drove up the wall
Put it in Reverse
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if that's what I need
Filthy south and D's
That's why I roll in from the Southside breeze
Give it to me now

[Chorus]

Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from the couch to the toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got dis broads acting foolish
And do this for a living
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife running dis streets, it sounds beautiful
Women break a cuticle
Ballas break bread
Southside, I represent it till I'm dead
What what

I make niggaz eat dirt and fart dust
Then give you a eighty dollar gift certificate to Pussies 'R Us
I eat the whole pie, and leave nothing but the crust
So you can feel what it's like, with instinct but no guts
A sac wit no nuts or a mack wit no sluts
Give me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched
They call me Seymour Butts, cause I get mo' ass than most
They say I'm next and got that butter love, and get too close
Follow the leader cause I'm meaner than medulla oblongota
My Tribe's on more Quests than Midnight Marauders
It's all pina coladas, no cops and robbers
Taking trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas
I hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires
If you say I'm not nice, then you'se a motherfucking liar
Entitled to your Opini-ons, into the next millennium
So many Major Coins that I thought I had a million

Of my psychical, my flesh is weak and it's pitiful
Spiritual is hooked up to the invisible
Umbilical cord of my Lord, Kumbiya Devine Kah
Remove paper of tar from every cigar
I slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa
Half Allah, Half Anti Christ Superstar
Rocking the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw
While I'm hitting trees, harder than Sonny Bono
Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo
I kill villains in slow-mo for talking crazy in my Dojo
Got nothing to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo
When I get Ludacris with bridges on the promo
Niggas wanna clown, I'm Homey and Bozo
Cause in the grand prize game my life calling like Jo-Jo
The name sticks like Toto
I keep it realer than alien autopsy photo
You similar to a Spice Girl going solo
You lost like BEBE, or a dog named Toto
My statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo
We Cop Robo, virgo
Bust ass like a motherfucking homo, como estas?

Built to destroy these kid's blocks of Legos
Lego my Eggo cause I say so
Hold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted
Manifested, elevated, I uplifted
The elevator, the escalator
""That's not a knife?  That's a knife!""
Crocodile Dundee the Alligator Rustler

Southside let's ride (say what)
And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
I drop shit like birds
And it's about the time for yo' ass to get served
Just lay it on down, just lay it on down 
While we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks
That a nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have time for the petty shit
Cause I got mo' dick, than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm having fun
I can make a hoe get like Forrest Gump and just ""run baby run""
I guess that they can't handle this
The brother's just too scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked,
Get up out my way just like in an ambulance (say what)
Gitty up gitty up ride on to the real, lay in death to the fake
And tell your boyfriend just to chill, don't player hate!

Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standing there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
Even in College Park after dark I'ma get that sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
But beginners give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetter the better, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have that rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak you like I just met ya

Reminisce like Mary, I gotta pop that cherry
Kinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie?
Better than my adversary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide, make you wanna dip and dive
Tripping while we rip and ride, 'til I get you to cum inside
Got you where I want yo' ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the present and erase the past
And be happy if we got mo' blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
In the guts 'til yo' butt don't shake like it used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo booster
No worry, no hurry - no pain, no gain
Better keep yo' eyes on strain
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, mayn
Sit back, relax and just take off yo shoes

Staying throat on the 'dro and keep that thing on the flow

And I got a ghetto aim with diamond 'bezeled rangs

Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies
So they can lock us up one at a time
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck!
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty
Me and Shaka still starving and looking for meals
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal
I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK
And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK

You can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile

Somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque

But when the shit start coming to a close 
Shit but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man
And start thinking quick
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros 
And tell 'em to suck a dick
And you tell just to get these
And you tell just to pay the fees
And to pay their dues, and they catching those STD's

Ya see, it started off in St. Paul from the street of Old Nash
And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
My clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream
All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's
And I had to fix a goodie bag and make decisions and haste
'Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste
So let's get looney up on the set cause I got five on the fire
Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer

Lookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and
Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something
That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'
My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken
Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues
And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes
Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors
In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest
And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest

It's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that
It's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back
I right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy
I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
'Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm
Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn
I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed
I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said

Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends
Today you see and then you cruise through the West end
They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia
Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older
If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times
I got em' all in check, when it comes to bustin' rhymes
Don't sweat the technique cause I just move the crowd
My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride

See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road
I heard the squad was wiped up, so I flipped my mode
On my way to d-e-cee, baby can't you see
That Decatur is totally to be	b-i-g for thee
Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners
It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down
They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound

Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked
I should be gettin' it, 'cause life is too got damn short
And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto
Back to the see-P, I put the pedal to the metal
God bless the child that's just got his own
Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home
I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road
It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride

Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free
And the tell me what's they fantasy
Like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me

I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave

But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy

I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name 
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy

I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy

I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy

I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes

[Ludacris]
Oh it's my turn?  Alright,
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock (what?)
She tried to juke me in a figure-fo' leg lock (oh)
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock
or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's
on
So stop the sweating like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
Cause I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We putting holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggas with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yapping is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist making women open they mouth wide
You be in jail still running it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth right, but who
cares?

[Chorus: x2]
I got my corner on lockdown
About to hold this whole block down
Ludacris tell um how the South sound
Uh Buddha-la ah, uh uh uh Buddha-la
Uh Buddha-la ah uh oh uh oh uh oh

[Verse 2]
Coming to Shady Park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missing more than Shaq when shooting free throws
They packing and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stopping cars like a roadblock
They moving weight like Atlanta was moving boat rock
And catching ums like seeun Muslims eating pork chops, never happen
And meanwhile I been thinking man
Niggas been slanging tapes like they slanging 'caine
Cause in the hood its getting ugly like orangutan
So if you trying to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we trying to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yelling our fucking pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggas you think they dyked out, so
don't play

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Disturbing The Peace, we do that funky shit
Hey, what can I say?  We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Ain't nothing nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like, 
hold up, god damn, I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is ticking me off like fifty metronome
I'm taking all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!
Alright? I got the pistol and the safe key
You better tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me
It's Ludacris wont leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?

So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking

Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em

Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle,
And I'm throwing text like a NBA ref
I got, all gold guns like they came from Iraq
Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
And ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'ma click
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm webbing choppers like helicopters
You goin' need hella doctors, when the glok go

Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip that text be quick
20 over there, Tity over there, Luda over there, ain't no exit trick
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks
Reload with the next clip, I'm the ro nigga to flex with bitch
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click
My pistol grip sound like this, now what
Who want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust
Y'all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Y'all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
I'm wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone
So there for you should invest, in a vest for ya dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Beast the nick, but my cannon go

Fuck a medic, we goin' call yo ass a taxi cab
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time on the month
A.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
Got killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit
Ill pay your cab back with the black mack
Till your back crack, got the gat back like, clack, clack, clack
Swallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber
Yo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar

Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song

Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen

Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me

Or we can break in your vibratin' tongue ring (come on)

[Chingy]
Peeps call me up, said it's a hotel party
Just bring the liquor; there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way); let me stop by the store
Get a twelve pack of Corona plus a ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 2-7, need a natural graze road
I'm already blowed; hit third, I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet lookin' like he in the game and must be winning
To room four-nine-O I'm headed; on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like ""wassup""
I told 'em: ""follow me"" 
They knew I had it cracking, B	
One said, ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Yeah, that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit' much ding-a-ling.""
Knock on the door; I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then; feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in here; I heard 'em whispering
Talking 'bout ""that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr'; he glistening.""
I ain't come to talk (talk), I ain't come to sit (sit)
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon' hit; aww, shit

[Chorus x 2]

[Chingy]
Ma showed up like, ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom, seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said, ""can I be in yo' video?"" 
I'm like ""yeah!"" Oh really?
Now she naked, strip teasing; me, I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G bring the camera
Then I thought about no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit' some girls lookin' like they from an island

[Chorus x 2]

[Ludacris]
Stop, drop, kaboom! Baby, rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little; make ya mammary glands giggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender vittles
Doctor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D,"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit' no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle down the beat wit' a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky; I'm wit' Chingy at the Holiday Inn

I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flow
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of a classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free 
And the tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me

[Chorus: x2]

I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candle lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the white house
Trying t make them turn the lights out 
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name a sauna, jacuzzi
In the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me or just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

[Chorus: x2]

I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, ruff sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade; tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat! Factories or on hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

Ludacris,"Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even going say the motherfucking rest
But you know
We can talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some fresh new shit

This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Riding it like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playing rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rapping lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by giving hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we taking this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we making noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's going drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspanielle in your poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now out wit me now

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
I just tell it how I see it nigga, fact is fact
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete and Big Boi beating through your Speakerboxxx

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Ludacris, yeah I keep a glock, in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, cranking the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
""So here he is, get the fuck on the ground""
Is just a phase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe I will stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you want to romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through neighborhood stop signs
Been a while, it's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
A hundred tho, bitch, diamonds shimmering
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, over throwed
Now we got seven more points on the board, for sure
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, ganster, poet
We goin spit it, we going show it to your ass
""You're a champion"" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say ""Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre""
I say ""people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay""
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We just split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spitting it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quitting

When a girl at the party when she backin' it
Now this girl dance freaky 'cause she passionate
If I ask for some chips, then she stackin' it
She don't need no introduction, she's a diamond of daw
And I don't mean no janitor, the way she mopping the flow
Tattoo on her backs saying 'ready to go'
Man this girl must get pimped away I'm ready too hoe
I'm going to take you out to ghetto girl around the globe
Freaking in the kitchen girl, go somewhere around the stove
In the chumps we chilling in some hotel robes
I put her towels on her body and massage her toes
There ain't nothing like some sex on a Friday night
But then again nothing like some sex in any night
After that gotta go got appointments girl
I'm a doctor, I got other clients girl
Now listen up close, I won't say it again
Skip a dog y'all cat is a man's best friend

Oh damn! There go expensive Chris
At the bar behind all the most expensive shit
And his car always got the most expensive kit
So his gun always got the most extended clip
Hey! Luda Luda, I'm built to last
Nicknamed double barrel and I'm built to blast
Since your girl ain't a freak, well you gotta convince me
Cause I'm all up in the fifth getting straight Lewinsky
And smoking some of that ""Kill Bill""
Ten Mil motherfucker I'm still trill
Can't party with the women that like it dick
Refuse to cut my hair like Michael Vick
Dirty bird even judges say the birds are dirty
We the reason that the clubs start closing early
Walk up and watch the crowd start moving quick
And I ain't gotta pay the DJ to play my shit

[Lil' Jon]
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
With the bull pimp cup man I'm sloppy drunk
I don't broke into club it's the king of crunk
Let the anal way find, and and the woofers blow
Throw some ass in my lap and I'm good to go
I spread a shined out bottle, crack a beer
While the ladies are all rubbing my neck and beard
No need to even ask it, who's the boss?
When the dreadlocks slam and the roof come off
The crunk juice got me up all night shit
And in last year making that bite shit
Not an essay calling me Loc De Niro
Stunned with my hell day, Oaklezero
Fresh by the front and I'm ready to play
Got the dog but I knew my had to lie (ok)

Hangover, wait a minute girl you leaving your clothes
And tickets gonna sell for a major show
If yousa a hater at the booth and the booth is closed
And move out the way I'm a Luda fan

Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,

And who else nigga? (Twista, wo, ah!)
Uh, uh (check it out)

Sometimes I think that I got to see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left or the right but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my ways
I still hear a fool and I track them, distract them, and whack them
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak them, attack them, and sack them
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night, so talk shit and I'm a lift them up off of they toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In a two-seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of dro
Smoking, choking, get them open, croaking
It's so potent - I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it or keep it hidden, good riddance I'm felling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off

Just shake it, great players get pumped

Get money fuck hoes, get crunk

I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti cofetti with a belly, Gucci
Timberland stepping on the petal up in the Cadillac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they all get some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for my city, anybody that different with me
Got to get him for thinking it's a game
And whether you from my city or not, talk shit
I'ma kill him especially if he say my name
I've been up on him - I handle my business
And I'm a stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat piller
Murder haters that don't feel a

And I done came a long way from letting me hold something, to roll something
Find a body, then fill him up with some adrenaline
And then kill him and send him to the cemetery

Check icy cold, your Pop's so hungry, he mends a berry
Shit, and when it come to shipping good
Who that?, who that?, I got the sack open

Maannn, these bitches is awfully nasty
And these bitches keep walking past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your bootie in the way and shake that shit!
(Now these niggaz is bout they bank)
(And these niggaz keep buying dranks)
(Lips creep from my body on your lips)
(Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit!)

S-H-A to the W double N-A
Real bitch don't play
Your eyes can't hide what your lips won't say
You're acting like the Dukes of the Fifth won't spray
It's okay, they gon learn
Chi's most wanted bitch wait your turn!
Sac full of yum I'm a make that burn
why'all can't smoke none anyway
Wild ones, walk wit a bitch through wild slums
Trying to figure out if they're scared of the hips or the chips
Or they really can't talk to a bitch wit wild guns
No games, hat to the side wit low frame
Now I came in this industry killin em
Now they all feeling me, sipping on Henny wit an O and a gram!

see-H-I to the see-A, G-O
If you ain't been, don't go
My city's so fast, you react so slow
Your heart might stop and your blood won't flow
(That ain't right) I stomp through the hood
Wit a grand on my feet like that ain't tight
Diamonds on my neck like that ain't bright
I come through and shut down the Saturday Night!
(Hell yeah) You can kiss that and
(Feel there) bring it right back
Don't mess wit the frame if you don't know a thing
Six years in the game, I'm still here
Hold up! They mad cause the streets is sold up!
I'm back on my feet, so watch for the cops, we'll never stop
Just rep for ya block and throw it up!

Better yet that's me
Most of why'all chicks gotta impress me
You say you got skills, put 'em up let's see
Show and prove, I hate to really see
What why'all goin through, put on any beat
We could spit it in the street
From the West to the East, or South to the house
Just showing love, go home
The body on the flo' is so grown
What cha gon' do, when you call to ya label
And ya gotta shed a tear, cause you hear ya career's
Been post-poned, back up

Take it to the trap, get clapped up

If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to apologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)

First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin', 'bout money, hoes, and rims again

And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is

I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D... a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale thats usin' a toothpick

Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $3.99
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss

But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't goin' cost me because she my caddy
'Cause she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug

She asked ""Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan

While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash

Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexus's one on both hand
So I guess them GS's was ambidextrous

Could of sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""

So say my name like Candyman
And I'm a come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out

If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out

Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)

But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my ""Eye Candy""
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar

It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
Get my hustle on

[Ludacris]
Look here!
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growing up and seeing life at it's worst
Then trying to iron out my wrinkles, putting family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinking my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be staying afloat
And I admit to being caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battling with myself and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up outta things that ain't none of my biz
And just cause something looks don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it
Is from the ground up a hundred miles and running
Dodging and ducking everybody trying to hammer me down
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me nothing still hungry as the day I began
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
Trying to get in where I fit, streets giving me hell
But yet I give it right, back, so how you like, that
Continue doing wrong 'til I was on the right, track
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a push
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Come on

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good

Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Living life on the cutting edge, taking a stab at it
And learning from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
Just admitting when I'm wrong, trying hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty people getting stitches in this world of scars
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds trying to pass the sky
Never blinking for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They want to catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringing so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles I'm making changes turning glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
Just be happy with yourself and it's so simple to grow
Come on

Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about balling, balling
Just thinking about brawling till y'all start bawling
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown

Ludacris,"Ooh you feel that as I take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots 
When nobody said life was going to be easy 
And we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life 
And we have our ups and downs 

Just keep in mind 
When you hit rock bottom 
There ain't no where to go but up baby 
Just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me... listen here 

[Chorus]
When life seems hopeless 
It make a n**** lose focus 
Empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause 
I'm so stressed and all I here is ""f*** the world"" [Repeat: x2]

Man ever since life been a gamble 
My life been in shamble 
Double edge sword burnin' both sides of the candle 
""But Cris, you can't handle the truth"" 

Don't want to face reailty 
So lord accept my apology 
Please like when police say freeze 
And I ain't do s*** 

But I'm down on my knees 
Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away I charge the game 
And put my problems on layaway 
A black man but I feel so blue 

So I smoke green and purple til my dreams come true 
Then my eyes turn red 
Sky turns grey 
Children slangin' white in the hood 

We call it yeah drink old gold 
Down my yellow brick road 
Then rewrite my script til my story's untold 
See I got a little money and my life sped up now 
I'm fallin' and I can't get up

[Chorus: x2]

I had to dream about a dope fiend 
And its strange 'cause he can barely write or read 
But seems to get folks about anything curious about him 
I wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that 

But I was more then welcome to walk with him 
As we walked 
He talked and I just listen 
He said there's a big difference between crackas and n****s 

See he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks 
When they ain't enough black roakz 
When you ooh to make a long story short 
We need pay more attention and do things that are more completes and he told me 

You know I wouldn't say something that wouldn't work and I wouldn't damn sure waste my time telling something that would hurt you 
But you would fall for anything 
If you don't stand for something 

But that's for certain but n****s don't be listen and that s*** be hurting 
No all of us but some of us 
And if we don't hurry up 
They going to bury each and every one of us 
 
[Chorus: x2]

Sometimes I can't deal wit my daily issues 
Just being sober lifes a b**** and I can't control her 
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on 
We need a shoulder 

The government stand us up 
To run us over 
And in the hood they don't seem to understand 
Goddamn!

What's really got me wondering 
Is if its a part of a bigger plan man 
I smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin' away the smoke from these swishers 
Goin' on it ain't much I can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money 

Wisely don't be obscured
By some things that depreciated like what like a home to open ya eyes to 
What's the f***s that's goings on 
'Cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one Whether Its drugs or diseases or gun by

Gun I ain't no saint either I feel that 
I'm even doing wrong by usin this chorus to get through this song

[Chorus: x2]

You know y'all going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40, 
50 years ago black folks need to move on
Y'all keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo a** tied up 
Wired up to them back roads south Florida, Georgia

And they made hem laws say they can't do anything for you
Can a church get a amen and god for them thugs too
Amen",Hopeless,2004
Ludacris,"[Chorus: x4]
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts

Now everybody wants a piece of my pocket
And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich
Calling people from my number now I block it 
Cause there's nothing worse then getting haunted by a stalkin' ass bitch (oh yeah)
Cause good game I'm talk it and yet you're so true some women will have you feeling blue like Crips
I lay my feet upon the path and I walk it.
I spread my wealth out or someone close will have me layin' in a ditch
I have my friends steal from me
Snatch my credit card out my wallet hit the town and leave outstanding bills for me
They say I got the cash for it and 
I can't recall one single member of my family that never asked for it
They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows 
They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my shows
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear ""c'mon 'cause you know I'm good for it"" (man)

[Chorus: x4]

Now don't get me wrong 'cause being rich is such a beautiful thing
But more money, more problems people drive me insane
Not giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
Put them in position and make their wishes come, true
So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
Given a million dollars, what you gone, do?
Map your life for your kid's kids or would you spend it over night?
Now see me I do both I got unlimited funds 
My daughters life was set before her stankin' butt turned one 
And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds
So if I choose before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun
My dividends can show and prove the real meaning of fun
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
The IRS'll never sweat me or even put up a fight
Cause I'm sure I pay more in taxes then you made in your life
Because

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse Three]
Now women these days don't want a man without a nice paycheck
So he splurge even though our lives ain't in the right place yet 
Buying jewelery and some cars just to impress these whores
Meanwhile your child's poor like, ""Daddy, what you left me for?!""
Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma (yup)
Who teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
I sweep her off her feet 'cause I'm her knight in shining armor 
And I have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her
Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggas are spiting
About these scandalous ass women that get money through gifts
They suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
So that brand new ride pick up our friends
While you're slippin' she slides
Drop top Benz gold diggers inside
Crazy what the world will do for money
Thinking that everything will be alright
Cause

If you got diamonds and they shining throw your wrist up!

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady looking for two women I can come in between
You can catch me chilling up in the cut but I'm always ready for action
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like {?} Jack-son
Maxing and relaxing, haters, do they really want to test me man
I got an arsenal waiting, do they really want to catch me man
No, I, don't, think, so
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so
I, make dough until there's none left
I run with plenty gangs that's holding things
And rearrange your frame in one breath
So to keep on breathing I suggest you take this beating
'Tis the season for bleeding and we've been looking for a reason

Hey hey
Come holla at me, I'm a star, I got the hood on smash
You know me! My whole car smell like a wood shop class
I point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth
Plus you and your friends
Let me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010
So I'm flocking 'em in, 'til the drop top is rocking again
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin
And I'm clocking these ends, my record sales are blocking 'em in
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen
My entourage is game faces, mean mugging, mean mugging
Now the media is convinced that we thuggin', we thuggin'
Momma told me grow up to be something, be something
I went diamond with this album so we bucking, we bucking

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me man
When I'm pushing 90 by myself up in the H.O.B. lane
They trying to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane
Being one of the few rappers responsible for changing the game
Now desperate artists trying to sue but they just making some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for nothing and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggas resort right back to baking that 'caine
And selling it off to junky monkeys who keep baking they brain
As they grow older they'll be feeling a lot of aching and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aiming that thing
And you ain't helping the process out by always caking these dames
But it is hard giving up the place where they be shaking they things

When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining
Bling! A little cute thing said, ""What's yo' name?""
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain
Oh oh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
Blow! Ludacris in the hoouse
The needle hit the record, they was playing this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back chilling in my be-boy stance
Could be a little pop locking if your girl's top droppin
But watch for cock-blocking on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that
honey in the black cause I'm feeling her curves
He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD
Why only serve one when we can serve up two
Then at the bachelor's pad, doing what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover
So we can have sex but I can't be your lover

And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape cool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but

I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I came to..

[Chorus: Lil' Flip, Tity Boi, Static]

[Lil' Flip] I came to bring the pain nigga!
[Static] And I came to bust them things nigga
[Lil' Flip] The night'll rearrange your frame nigga
[Lil' Flip] You scared nigga!
[Static] You scared nigga!
[Lil' Flip] One more time
[Lil' Flip] I came to bring the pain nigga!
[Tity Boi] And I came to change the game nigga
[Lil' Flip] The night'll rearrange your frame nigga
[Lil' Flip] You scared nigga!
[Tity Boi] You scared nigga!
[Lil' Flip] Oh oh!

[Verse 1: Lil' Flip]
Get out my face, get out my face! (you is a hoe hoe)
You talk behind my back, back (but I know know)
I pack a 4-4 (and I bust bust)
And I ain't leaving this mess (in hand cuffs cuffs)
You better put your hands up (what?)
Get them little budget then wrap your fans up but you still won't
 catch up
Cause I'm connected on the East (East), I'm connected on the West
 (West)
I ain't saying I'm the best (best) but I feel like I'm blessed (blessed)

I got thirty on my neck (neck) and twenty in my mouth (mouth)
But if I feel disrespected, I'm a call your ass out
They gone haul your ass out now you crying like a bitch
I told you not to fuck with the Screwed Up Clique

[Chorus: Lil' Flip, Tity Boi, Static]

[Verse 2: Tity Boi]
Bring the pain, hard core, selling cane
Sun, snow, water, rain
Shorty I will flip this stuff until the task force came
Tried to rearrange the game, tried to bang, I suck at slanging

New slang I had to switch it up, wrap a pimp cursing on the track

The mack will leave you on your back, strap will leave you with
 a gap
Stop smiling! - glances you see visions of the past
You see niggaz with masks, up in cars with no tags
When we balling! - I'm from the apartments, started with all of
 it
Different day same clip, so close I can't miss
Tity, Flip, Ludacris, got bricks, roosters, chicks
Snatching bread then we dip, it's South Side - represent!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now the clique is called D.T.P. so get your crew right
We peer pressure fools, even +Dudley+ don't +Do-Right+
So go on your city, it's a South rebellion
We putting ""foots"" in your asses, how we speak Australian?
I'm trained in the art of whoop ass, check my accolades
Got a knife and I'm giving out free after shaves
Plus a new acting gig, take a look at the CLIP!
It's called one up in the chamber and four on the HIP!
I snatch your girls in the club and use them as throat throttles

Then you'll get hit with fifteen mini Moe bottles
Got glocks for your stocks and that thing for your chain
And uh, mutual guns for your mutual funds main!

[Chorus: Lil' Flip, Tity Boi, Static]

Got a little spot we go kick it, sit back relax get you a drink and
Get to know each other, girl let me know what's up
We can leave up out of this club, girl I'm feeling you so bad

Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you

Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit

Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,

My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,

So we can catch a corner, or we can catch a square
Any place, any time, I'll be waitin' right there

See I give you a bad one and shoot you in the spine

All we know is survive, we ain't taking no ails
So before you play with us, you best play with yourself

'Cause I'm tired of the tough talk, tired of the mean mug

Who's baddest on the block? What my status in the game?
The records that I've sold, Bobby V going gold
And all them number one chart positions that I hold

The money and the wealth, well, I'll keep it to myself
But I'm always willin' to share the firepower on the shelf
I'm shiny star spanglin', ding-a-ling danglin'

I'm banging in the East, West, South, all over the map, boy
I do it for myself, my daughter, and all these trap boyz

[Chorus: x2]
We on the grind in, Georgia
All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you

Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,
I got a Chevrolet on 26's,
I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia

You have a call from an inmate in a correctional facility
Inmate, state your name (Darren)
This phone call may be monitored and recorded
Press 3 if you accept the charges, if not hang up

[Ludacris]
To my cousin Darren Ranch, stay up homie
To my brother Chris Butler, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep making it through
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you
To my brother Mikey Mike, stay up homie
To my cause J.B., stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep making it through
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you
You looking at a man that would
die for his daughter, just to let her breathe
And I'd definitely die for Jesus cause he died for me
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks
Look up in my mailbox, I get letters from my cause
and every week said he wanna hit the streets
But he never struck a deal cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna
If you ever have to leave I got your mother and your daughter
Born in this way of living and our youth is stuck
To be safe it's safe to say the justice system's fucked up!
If you doing 25 to life, stay up homie
I got your money on ice so, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep making it through
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you
All my peoples in the pit, stay up homie
And until you hit the bricks, stay up homie
If you locked in the box keep making it through
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you

Until I went to jail you couldn't tell me, I ain't seen it all
That box, a motherfucker, it could stress a nigga balls
Especially when you broke and home base ain't accepting your calls
And you don't hear your name when it's mail time
Caught in damn jailhouse barbers pushing back on your hairline
Fucking ? will have you stuck in that pill line
Your bitch miss the V-I this weekend
The food in your locker keeps shrinking, your celly feet stinking
The canteen ran out of menthol's
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers
Niggas play the phone room reckless and get hit with new indictments
Talking about old connects and new prices
Stress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face
Or stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case
That shit I used to tell my walkie
Lil' Itchy, all he did was smoke weed and drink coffee
I know he miss me
To my man Lil' Nell (stay up homie)
To my man Steve P (stay up homie)
If you locked in the box keep makin it through
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you
To my man Paul Selene (stay up homie)

Uhh, if your people locked up you need to send 'em some shit
Cause it's never too late to stop being a bitch
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world
When I was down them niggas fell out so I'm riding with the girls
Cause they got mo' heart, than them fake ass dudes
They send no letters, no books, and no money for no food
Cause commissary is so very necessary
It's so close to bein slavery, in Texas nigga it's scary
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home
And when him home, let me go I make sure that his books was on
And three months later that nigga came home too
Ain't no limit to this shit cause now his dream's coming true
I'ma keep riding with Bun cause UGK will never stop
And I'ma stand up for my partner, steady let them off a lot (yeah)
Bitch, and I'm as trill as you can be
They scream ""Free Pimp C"" but not see the pimp free (here I go)

Wake up, roll call, another day gone by
Now put a 'X' on November 25 I'm still alive
Open the dead roll balls
Now this dead man walking parking million dollar cars
It's slavery, hard labor, catch the feel
Redneck on the hearse while you walk, it's real
With a shotgun, burning at the back of your dome
300 years left, my dog ain't never coming home
One fight, dude got stabbed, he lost the nine
Almost died, in Camp Jay nigga, ride or cry
Cream has suicide attempts, Precious took his own life
White boys can't handle the pain at night
You gotta fight for your shoes, or get your ass shook

Get 'em up, get down, turn around and put your face in the pillow
Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer
Half man, half gorilla, beating all on my chest
Pleasing all of your flesh, squeezing all on your breast
Giving you reasons to rest, and ain't never say no to papi
Wake 'em up like Folgers cause I fold 'em like origami
Hey mami let's get it popping like Orville Redenbacher
The way you move once you started nothing could ever stop ya
Sweeter than Betty Crocker, and I'm ready to belly flop ya

(Whoo!) Verse two, it's like this

Gotta get 'em up out of them clothes, if I throw a couple dollars then pose
We could drink a couple bottles and go, and ride off in the Impala on vogues
And Rolls, gold is all on my neck, all on my wrist
So just let go of yo' hoe, don't hog her to death, lend her to Chris
Just for a little while for a little bit
Just wanna see her smile and get the bigger fish
She said that you had a little dick
Now how in the hell can she benefit from something like that?
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back
Black, I swing low and sweet chariot, meet me at the Marriott
Key access, I'll be at the very top
Don't hesitate to stop the elevator either
I'll show you the ups and downs, you'll be my elevator diva

All I need is a couple hours baby, for real

Come up out that Prada, Chanel, Chloe, Louis and Gucci
Escada, Dior, Fendi, that Masconi and Juicy
Rocking Republic, True Religions and Citizen's jeans
Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giseppi's is mean
La Pearla lingerie, ya panties and bra matching
Put down your clothes and I'll put you up on the latest fashions
Cause with cameras and action, I'm a deadly assassin
I love your clothes but what's underneath I love with a passion

See I could replace a Cadillac but I can't replace my momma
I'm sorry for the hip-hop beefs, we sorry for the drama
But you gotta understand us rappers ain't never had nothing
And one's loss is another's gain so we gotta grab something
Lord, got so many questions I need the answers to
And sorry for the things I put my baby's mama through
I feel that women are really the strongest human beings
But why do you make 'em so emotional, and other minor things
I guess it's your way of saying we gotta love 'em and gotta praise 'em
Cause without 'em we'd be nothing, plus our kids they gotta raise 'em
While we, out and about and seeing what life has to offer
But if you offer a new life then what we need is better fathers

I'm only human, I'm not always in the best of moods
But thanks for giving the gift of rap to write my feelings down
And sorry for cursing sometimes but feelings make me shout 'em out
Forgive the people that wanna blame everything on rap music
If they didn't live it they can't relate or even adapt to it
Forgive those who don't think I'm great and wanna see me go
Forgive Oprah for editing most my comments off her show
Don't get me wrong, I know some people got a image to hold
But those who criticize the youth might just be getting too old
We still traveling through life, finding what's right or wrong
I know some folks may not agree or even like this song
But I'm just speaking MY truth, cause I heard it sets you free
And my conversation's with God, even though he speaks through me
I'm smarter cause of my daughter, and I'm not too dense

[Chorus 2]

[Bishop Eddie Lee Long]
What you just heard is real life
It's real life for you, it's real life for many
It's about where you been, yet at the same time you
Hey, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Yes I'm talking to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Cause you realize hey, it's, time to change right now
And in the middle of that I wanna say this
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child
I understood as a child, I fought as a child
Hey, but when I became a man
I put away those, childish things
Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghetto's
In the upper downtown, wherever it was
The people around you, the things around you
Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book
God called you a prophet
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out
And it commands attention, it commands change
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you
And in the midst when you're, starting to understand
That I caught the wrong message, and now it's time
I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God
He said, ""Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation""
Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold
Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you
It's time to stop the killing
I said it's time to stop the stealing
It's time to stop disrespecting our women
It's time for us to come home and raise our children
It's time for us, to really mold our communities
It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion
But to get hooked up in relationship, with God
And the amazing thing about it
Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess
And you can tell God ""I'm sorry;
I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing
I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right
And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me
And I may have done the things, that they said I did
But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be
And I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments
But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up
And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line
Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!""
You can't resist the change
And you're not condemned by your yesterday
If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny
Move, change, and be, now!

Searching so long, lost in the clouds
Trying to stay strong, and make you proud, make you proud!

For instance, this is me. What did you expect from the 5th LP? 
Gone for a minute now I'm back again. 
Back to back, back to break backs again. 
Put'em in the back seat of the 'lac again, and rip off the Magnam packagin'. 
What's happening I'm looking for some girls gone wild.(gone wild)
I'm just trying to make these girls all smile(all smile). 
And I'm gonna make'em dance, 
So I could see them shake they ass, 
Then I put'em in a trance, 
Till I get'em out they pants. 
Then I'll take'em to a level they might've never been before, 
We goin' hit the door. And then hit the floor, you'll get hit below. 
I got somebody I want you to get ta know.

Could take the whole game a minute to top this. 
Just figured out that I'm ahead of my time, wit a flow so fast I'm ahead of my rhyme. 
Ya clock is off beat, better set it to mine. 
With a 6 year run havin' a helluva time. 
Cause I'm always looking for some girls gone wild.(gone wild)
I'm just trying to make these girls all smile(all smile). 
And I'm gonna get high, till I make'em touch the sky, 
Then I make'em wonder why, why why am I so fly? 
Cause I took'em to a level they might've never been before, 
We goin' hit the door. And then hit the floor, you'll get hit below.

Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out 
Peace out, A-Town gone and then I dipped out 
And, oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out 
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out 
Somebody get him, the lil' nigga's out of control 
Put a lil' bit of rum in my bottle; I'll dream about diamonds and gold 
Gold, gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent 
The essence of adolescence got my body feelin' fresh'n 
Fresh'n, fresh'n, and it was a blessin' to rhyme and start reppin'

You better cook slow but that money come fast 
I got what you need; I hope you brought all the cash 
You know the kid pimpin' all over the world

Pickin' up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown 
Only reason you on that song is 'cause I turned that down 
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys 
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's 
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions 
From hangin' on the block to throwin' parties in the Hamptons 
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a 
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no Marta 
From dice on the curb to stackin' up chips, but harder 
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick! 
Guard your women, dog 
I went from ashy to classy 
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doin' the nasty 
Reach your hand up in the air, and you can play with the stars 
It's not the hand that you're dealt, but how you're playin' your cards, boy!

We true to these streets
I got 12 hungry artists, whole crew gotta eat
So hell no I don't sleep I'm like an energizer battery
Got 19 employees I gotta pay they salaries

Got killers on the payroll, I hired some cops
I accept responsibility, they all pay rent

Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen

Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out

She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her

Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking, why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking, why did you take him away? (Why'd you take him?)
Why did you take him away? (Hey)

I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
'Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today (real talk)

Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin')
Callin' up my mobile, cussin' (cussin')
Always yappin' about this and that
But she really don't be talkin' 'bout nothin'
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it)

[Chorus: x2]

Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my forty-five
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away (hey)

Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away
Wasting my time away?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it)

My grand mama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
'Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (Don't say nothin')
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo)

Troops gone, and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today 
(Live like today could be your last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey)

Daddy is that your car on TV?

[Ludacris]
You better believe it is baby
Now go in the other room
It's about to be some grown folks talking here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these faking ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talking 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thing
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's goin' run ya about a grand so start saving your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signing ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowing, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

[Chorus: Ludacris]
But I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit alone'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothing about ya (nah)
If you stop selling records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixing business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)
All that, and this is really just the start of it (just the start of it)
Hip-Hop!  You really wanna be a part of it?

[Chorus: Ludacris]

[Ludacris]
Let's go!
What's worse than having no money is having it and losing it (yup)
What's worse than having some money is grabbing and abusing it (yup)
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him (nah)
I wish his ass well but I don't want nothing to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishing me?  I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supporting the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth (what's that?)
Is don't trust nobody but your GOD damned self!

Recollect the 15 million I've sold or the 30 times I went gold and if you take 2 puffs of this dro then it'll give you satisfaction.

I've sold the most and no ones close but I'm not meaning to brag.
Its different strokes for different folks like Angelina and brad.
Some keep the heat in the stash, put 30 keys in the jag, 
And if cops ain't peeping your tag your gonna feel some satisfaction.
Pumping out albums like reverend run is pumping out children; here's another one
Catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland.
I'm bound to be the greatest, I'm determined to win. until then I can't get no satisfaction.

Ya, blow me a shotgun [Repeat: x4]

I'm the one that went to the gun fight with a knife, and won.

Just because my verse second, don't mean that I'm not the one when I'm done 
I'm guaranteed to give you satisfaction.

I might not be the best in the world but the best the worlds ever seen.
I'm all been in Georgia's daughter code ding-a-ling king
And when I'm digging deep in the spleen, I'ma make the cream and she scream
Baby get me hard like a snickers bar I give her satisfaction.

The southern way no other way so mother fuck what you say.

Back that ass up like Juve, cause the south we giving them satisfaction.

Ever since I signed with luda and them, my chances of losing is slim. 
Y'all talk that smack but copy-cat and do a movie like him. 
Yes sir my mob got that goodie, as if my group had a kid. 
We gonna continue to give them another doe of satisfaction.

Ya blow me a shotgun [Repeat: x4]
I got that fire [Repeat: x4]

Yeah drop tha bomb, when I rhyme its like tnt. 
That's why my money long as the line at the dmv. 
When they asking, who was that, that was snapping. 
I'm that answer dude like snickers with no nuts no satisfaction.

I hustle and flow, mighta been by my cheese since I was knee high.

Get popped with the four four

Don't be the reason they mopped in the floor for paying me, that (satisfaction)

Ludacris,"The time has come, for bad things to leave 
The time has come, for life to begin 
The time has come, for the war of the gods 

It's that time 
I'ma take the subtle approach first 
'Cause I'm just gettin' started 
Let's go 

Look, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it 
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it 
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it 
But keep runnin' yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it 
I never claimed to be nuthin' but who the fuck I am 
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin' man 
Understand, nuthin' you did makes you better nigga 
You claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga 
Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em 
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room 
And still have room for young Karma to play 
Givin' back to the children of tomorrow, for good karma today 
So you can say what ya wanna say, and you can talk that talk 
But real niggas ain't doing no talkin' cause we walk that walk 
Album for album you can see I got a multimillion plan 
So call yourself whatever you want 'cept the multimillion man 

How many times is you goin' rap about busting your gun 
How many times is you goin' trap without busting your gun 
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general 
Disrespectin' those doin' real time with real criminals 
And I ain't never did a day in my life 
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life 
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth 
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south 
I give a damn about ya hootin' and hollerin', and it ain't botherin' me 
I hear you talkin' but you ain't made it to three 
You know where I live, but you ain't made it to me 
You ain't made nigga 
I'm havin' a house party, kid come get played nigga 
You got played, my record label never jerked me 
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me 
I feed off your energy, my powers with God 
So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard

See even without the bass and all that treble I'm as hot as the devil
And I work for the top floor, homie get on my level
I've been stripped away of powers 'cause I gave you my blessin'
So it'll take more than majority vote to win this election
Man, mix tapes or not my resume is too hot
And I warned them that I was coming, I got the number one spot
So unless you using tampons, quit acting stuck up
And do like your records say, or shut the fuck up",War with God,2006

Down to make them get down, stop playing n pause
Its two things I'll never break, that's my word n my balls
So here's a temporary fix for your permanent flaws
This album helps you to release cause life urkin' us all
Enough to make you wanna break shit
No longer will I take shit
From any of these clowns, cause I'm tired of this fake shit
I'm ready for some action
Ready wit a passion
Like pots with the steam, I'm ready to git it cracking

Tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and its gone be on
Soul Train, wood grain, from me
No pain, no gain, its so plain to see
They be like ""I've been feeling kind of stressed can you blow my back out?""
And I'm like ""Yea but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out""
When I get done its smooth sailing once I pull that 'Lac out
Next destination I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse
And 1, have fun, when you chilling with Ludi
Slow grind and slow jams while I'm feeling yo booty
We'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that coochie
You so fine I'm so sad that you feeling so woozy

Got you feeling woozy baby (baby)
And that's hows it gonna be when I take you from the club to the crib
On dubs and I get you in the bed with me (in the bed with me)
Your so pretty, and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready
Girl I'm surprised you this nasty
But its cool cause I always wanted to go down on a girl that reminds me of me

Will YOU, make me feel like I just hit the lotto
Other girls I give 'em a shoulder colder than Chicago
But in ya center I heat it up in the Mourning like Alonzo
And I'd get it, I'd bit it, I'd split it, I'd hit it up in a Tahoe
Bravo, make make make it clap I'd break break break ya back
Then tuck tuck tuck you in so you can take take take a nap
Then back to making dividends I'm in the wind
Somewhere hot, I stay on islands longer than Gulligan
Sipping on a pina colada, little mama I'ma make ya holla
How does it sounds when you making love on a Million dollars
I can only imagine lets make it real baby
Like D'Angelo ""How does it feel"" baby
I know I talk a lot shit but I can back it up (up up)
Like BBD flip it, rub it down, smack it up (up up)
You so bad when you call me for duty
You so fine I'm so sad that you feeling so woozy

Don't get caught up in the gossip, them chicks is jockin' girl
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rocking ya world
Hey girl, hey friend, how you doing, where you been
Enough of that talking, lets begin, break it in
Shake and spin, take it in, say amen
Then I'll make you say goodness gracious
Look me in the eye and make them nasty faces
I'm so glad that your body's so juicy
You so fine I'm so sad that you feeling so woozy

Testing, one, two, three (Testing, one, two, three
Hey, listen to me, listen, hey)

[Verse One - P.Diddy]
It's tricky, I'm picky, baby, but I just spotted you
Doing your thing, G-string, shoe string point of view
Lend me your body, you got me in a zone
Bet a million in a half cash i can make you explode
You don't wanna brave the cold, you wanna Diddy Combs
I can take you on outer limits away from home
(?) ..... (?)
In the middle of the club doin' a rodeo show
The hoes seem skeemy, wet dreamy
Emphasism obsessed gleemy
(Incredible sex) You need me
You can ease me, please me baby
I maybe am little crazy but in a way...

[Hook - Akon (DJ Felli Fel)]
Don't make me get buck in here!
Shawty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
But all I need is a one night scandal
And I'ma get buck in here!
Damn, lil mama, know you fit my standards
You the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' that grandam
(While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
Just shake that thang, shake that thang)

Spin like my record at your radio STATION
Feel the SENSATION, I put it right there
They be like ""Luda!"", I be like ""Y-yeah!"",
You like it like that, don't ya baby
The flow's insane, and the stroke is crazy
I stroke so good, like Tiger Woods
And i RAWR, like a tiger would
My livelihood is not Hollywood
I'm still Southside Atlanta, that's a lively hood
A circus, big top, like Ringling Brothers
If you wanna learn something, bring your mothers
Sit back and observe, invite some friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin
Felli on the cell-y with a couple of twins
Cause tonight, damn right, we gonna do it again

[P.Diddy] Aiyyo, Felli let me one more time

Listen, women, lace them, G-force jets, fly 'em
Twisted, crooked, cell phone numbers, probably
Flip em change em, prissy and bouji, the hood (?)
Game of taste em, trissy's I'm runnin' em good (?)
Leather or silk, I melt them all
Love em, leave em, give em hell for sure
Tell them words they minds and souls deserve
Or give them things they might prefer

Used to style em, now just virgin island

Ludacris,"Disturbing the peace, okay
We don't die, we multiply 'cuz there's a strength in numbers, baby
So I brought some of my family members here today
To talk to y'all about celebrity chicks
So Ching-a-ling, why don't you go ahead
And start this thing off for, what up?

From the moment she wake up, so Hollywood puttin' on her makeup
Can't save her but it's always a fool to keep her caked up
You ask the chick out, tike the say where you gon' take her
And see the, to Vegas or Cali to see the Lakers

She brought that paper, getting over on Cat's major
This at the Billboard's I seen for real name in the pager
Say what, most of these balls they can't fade her
She stay fly, Dolce Gabbanna and Marc Jacobs

You can catch a Melrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

She got a loan and can't pay the rest
So she got another brother writing a check
I'm talking if she want it bad enough, she will get it glad enough
She can run it, run it at the same time standing in place

And got a long list of giving me
And who will be buying tables man, I'm out of here
But it's to late now, she can see I'm paid now
That I can make it rain now, say now I think I lost a girl

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

I see some celebrity chicks everywhere that I be
Everywhere that I've been, the selection or celebrity chicks to see
I see Meeg and I see Mia, I be wantin' to meet 'em
I can see them in the sheets when I imagine me between 'em

I'm straight up off the streets the MC
And I've been waiting to see Heaf
So I could shred it to him rough ride
And I leave it to the back seat of the Beamer

And hear that heatin' and give lil' mama the reason
To send papa to a region, as hot as a pot steamin'
I wanna be the secret that me and Trina keepin'
I'm hood enough for the girl I keep and every toe I Keisha

Good lord Jesus, she can go and pet the jeezer
I just want it for the weekend
I got the power to be 'bout it, I'm not a weakling
I'm trying to fly out to see Jessica Alba in bikini's

Holla at us when you see us, if you want us, how I need us

Its for the money this time

Howdy do motherfuckers its Weezy Baby,
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta toke the cannon.
Listen close I got duct tape and rope,
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'bannons.
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin',
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet.
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg,
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it,
Bet that baby.
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy this a set back,
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap.
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone,
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,
Shout out my nigga fee.
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key,
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see.
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea.
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man,
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.

Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya,

Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)

Ayo
I make it hard for rap niggas I'm peer pressure,
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better.
I show niggas how to act how to dress better,
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers.
I'm the crack 
The smack 
The gun 
The rule 
The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool 
The motherfuckin' (cannon).
Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill,
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill,
The deal is sealed.
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon).
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale.
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held.
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas,
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas.
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon.
And I'm on that Philly fire shit,
Then I come fully equipped.
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip.
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him.
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada.
Homie know I'm inside of your house,
Tie up your brother.
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you.
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'.
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will.
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card.
You chumps, you best call General Motors.
I will, take control of your soldiers.
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken.

First the Fat Boyz break up
Now everyday I wake up
Somebody done call it quits
Shit I thought Bobby and Witney stay together forever if they made it that long
I guess the drugs weren?t that strong
And now its Russell and Kamora even Jordan and Wanita
And to top it off Brad left Jen for Angelina
What the hell is going on in this World?
This just can?t be!
If Will and Jada can do it then why can?t we?
Hillary is still with Bill Clinton,
How did they do it
He got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it! 
Now Paul McCartney losing half of his life
All because he got divorced from his wife
Somebody said its cheaper to keep her 
But not in K-Fed's case (nope!)
Cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case (Cha-Ching!)
Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne
And if you broke up wit your girl
I know you feelin da pain because?

What the hell went wrong?
Maybe folks will wise up and take heed to this song because

So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,

Niggas keep dropping like flies
Snitching ain't going cut no time (I'm so hood)

Yeah yo my p o y'all can tell I said it
Five later she going have to come cash me
Bitch test me all you want, I'm a smoke when I'm ready
Pants hanging off me nine cause my pistol heavy (hood)
I ain't spoke to you yet dog, cause I ain't friendly
I drank light homie y'all drink crisp
I like pussy handy I want that boogie bitch
I never buy a phantom twenty eight's can't fit
They say I'm dead bound, and that I'm high risk
My four bloody goon, lanes make me sick
You get three or four birds before we call you rich

The wait is over homie
Yes it is
A town connect
Know the city gon' feel this
Damn right
Say Toob I know you see me
Say Chris
What up boy
I know both our pops
Lookin' at us

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddamn it we made it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to gs that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
Been talk about it for years and now we finally here

And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

They say what goes up must come down
But I ain't reached my cruisee altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said look out for me
And see these expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in seeapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like whats up motherfucker!

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa

I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
So all we got is street cred and a cool building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from (answer that)
Jeffrey standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time goddamn good at it

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa

I'll play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)

Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober

I'm headed to the club, lokin' for a freak,
To spread a lil' love, to spread a couple cheeks,
Pull up to the spot, 26's like beam,
Eyes on me like ""bitch, do you see em'?
Stroll to the front dor headed to the vip,
Bought a couple bottles and I tok a couple sips,
Strokib' out the room and what do I see?,
A nice round butt and a pair of double d's,
So, I crept up like shawty what's happenin'?,
You killin' that dress and I love it with a passion,
Then she turned around and her face was aight,
She had a gap toth and a mean overbite,
But I was like hm!

If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
Is that what you wanna do shawty?,
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
You too!

Woke up the next mornin' and all I can remember,
Was takin' shots and tippin' the bartender,
Surrender to the woman, end up bringing me home,
Cause' she started lokin' better, every shot of patron, (yep!)
I jumped up wit a devilish grin,
Cause' tonight, damn right! I might do it again!
So I called up the homies, (whaddup??) let's ride,
We can hit the sports bar, over on the southside,
Get a couple of coronas, couple of limes,
Went up to the bar, saw a couple of dimes,
So I, slowly walked up and said hi!
My name is Ludacris and I'ma hell of a guy,
One said I know who you are,
I'm your number one fan,
And right now, it's to bad, I got a man,
And I said I understand,
But where the hell is he at??
Cause' in a minute, if he dont show up, then man

If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
Is that what you wanna do shawty?,
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
You too!

Aye pain holla at em right quick man!

You gon get in trouble with your man girl,
(don't get in trouble girl)
Talkin bout how you're my biggest fan girl,
(i know what I'm doin')
Now I don't wanna do,
(pleasee)
What if you gon make me do?
(don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
If I had one more drink

One more drink I'ma get cha,
Home, then I'll split cha,
Grab the camera phone,
And take a bunch drunk pictures,
Cause' hennessy mixed wit a whole bunch of buddha,
Equals you, mixed with a whole bunch of Luda,
And you know how far one drink could go,
Start slurrin' my speech, slowin' up da flow,
Hikin' up these skirts,
Climbin' up your shirt,
It's mr latenight Luda and I like to flirt,
So guess what babygirl

If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
(just one bok)
Is that what you wanna do shawty?,
(that's all it gon take)
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon'fuckin' you,
(who else t-pain?)
You too!

You hear what I'm sayin'??
People to picky these daysdamn it!
To tall, to short, to fat, to skinny,
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminating,

It's a war goin' on outside 
And my people gotta paint they faces on.
And what I gotta do, And what I gotta do
Is work and flip a dolla'.
Ain't got no trophies
But I got a shelf of empty liquor bottles.

Not an alcoholic but alcohol it,
Can ease the pain.
Drinkin' all my problems away
But still prayin' in Jesus' name.
Tryna' turn our voices up, 
And the government tones us down.

And the hood is goin' down.

And watch yo' side to side.
Betta' grab yo' gat, light that blunt;
The streets gon' ride tonight.

And I'm just gon' ride it out,
Til my expiration date.
'Cause I go hard and the paint (?), 
They softer than paper plates.
Make way for the revolution,
And yes you should be scurred.
Cause one way or another
My people will be heard.

Show you what the soldiers see:
Embassy, Diplomacy,
Since seen (?) infantry,
Shootin' at the cobra fleet (?).
Deploy shots, similar to airbags, whereas,
This hairpin, trigga' split a hair in half.
Body bags, fish it (?) like Harland (?),
When I'm airin', tear a chair in half.

Watchin' Half Baked,
At the cabin by the Lake.
See the blue and white plates,
See the wood on the panel.
I may be Chanel Oat, Chilly O, Flannel Coat (??).
Warfare? Never fair,
Therefore, I need finer things:
Like grenades; tanks; a couple fighter planes.

I'm decorated in medals;
Stripes like a Zebra.

I don't like you neitha'.

To print another new gas prices.
All this fuckery we got goin' on,
Indeed it needs to cease. 
How the hell is that ever, ever gonna happen
When the value of the dollar keeps decreasin'?

Easin' my hand in somebody's pocket 
(Fuck that!) I gotta' keep eatin.
Speakin' for everybody in the struggle like me,
We gotta get it even if we cheatin'!
Breathin' hard, my mind is blown,
Tryin' not to get evicted out my home.
But tryna' live when you know a nigga' broke 
Is like tryna' squeeze blood out a stone.

But I'm goin' through the drama with DJ Drama (What!?).
I do it for my kids and mama (Who!).
Leave it to Barack Obama (Yes!),
Change is right around the corna'.
You tryin' to keep our people sufferin', 
All I gotta say is if you don't ease up this pressure,
I promise somebody gonna' pay!

(Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness!
Pursuit, huh? 
See Each and every day we all get closer
To the real meanin'.
Me, myself? I always follow my own path
And now I come here to motivate! 
""To be heard"" means to say something of value.
So I make this my Life,
My Liberty,
And everyday, my pursuit.

Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when I see you do it,
Better then I ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama's ever seen it in her life time,
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause I can't get wit chick ya just show me how to dance (Oh!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then I might show you girls a thang or two,
Yea I think you a superstar wit' a ass like that you gotta blow,

Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone,
How many licks does it takes
Till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,
I love how they seem to please us,
I wanna taste them butterican pican peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces,

Give him some bottles of this conjure cognac just to shut him up

He's still trying to get back like the soldiers

Shoot up on the brain, but you lame now it's over

Welcome back to 
Battle of the Sexes Radio
Where it is 12:45 in the A.M.
And Disturbing The Peace
Is our in studio guest
Our hot-line is lit the fuck up
With people with relationship issues
Caller number one, you're on the air

Yeah, man, y'all tell me if I'm crazy
Because this girl in here trippin'
You know what I'm sayin'
I'm a real man
I take care of my home
I take care of my kids
I pay all my bills
I mean, I ain't gonna lie
I may check a little female from time to time on the side
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
But what man don't?
So how can I break this down to her?

Ludacris, how do you feel about
This particular situation?
Get your money right, ladies
Learn to sign your own checks
But don't call me after midnight unless we havin' sex
Don't ever assume nothin', no
Man gon' be a man,
A groupie gon' be a groupie
A fan gon' be a fan
These tricks gon' keep on trickin'
Those hustlers gon' keep hustlin'
As long as there's new coochie
Dogs gon' keep fuckin'
So don't be all up in my phone
Replyin' to women's pages
I thought your mama taught you
You should never talk to strangers
Don't you ever ask no question
That you really don't want the answer to
So stop poppin' off at the mouth
Like Neno Brown I'll have to cancel you
Handle you, stop the ride, leave you on the avenue
Half of you always wantin' some nigga to pampa you
And that'll do for him, but not for me
I'll probably baffle you
And if he wants to act a fool
I'll show 'em what the gat will do
Run along, go find somebody to snitch on or go chit-chatter to
Then your name will follow a
What ever happened to

Exactly, that's just what she need to hear
Damn right, player, a'ight, thank you
For callin', next caller

Yeah, I hear you
But let's talk about the fake-ass brothers
With the twenty four's, but cannot pay the note on they lease
And my nigga with his high style chains
And I can't get him to pay his damn child support
That's why we makin' mo' money and ownin' our own property
And right just as nice, so now
I guess if we want to, we can bare ya too now

Interestin', Shauna, you wanna
Stick on this one?

Get your money right niggas
Get a bitch that can keep up with you
I'm tired of thinking to myself
Why in the hell did I ever fuck wit' you
Don't step wit' you
Sick of your childish games and all the stuff you do
I probably mentioned your name
But, true to the game, I've had enough of you
I've seen your type before
Doin' the fours all over the floor
He's flashin' his chain's, he's flashin' his dough
He drinkin' the fifths, then drinkin' them all
But what you don't know, this nigga fraud
He can't even afford to smoke
Back in the hood all the hustlers and G's know he's a joke
That's why I treat a nigga
Just when he eat it I tell him 'beat it, nigga
Real bitches, true to the game
That's how you G, nigga
D-T-P stayin' the zone like we own P-C-P
Chrome on the S-S Shawn, I blow the P-C-P
Y'all niggas ain't on my level, I do it so hood
Pineapple and berry weed, we feeling so good
Lightning is Sup-doo, I get my own stack
That's why I leave them two hundred
I never call back
That's right Shauna pussy rule the world

Yes, it does, next caller
What's up?

Man, what's up? 
This is Marv
I wanna know the y'all that somebody talk to
This triflin'-ass woman like me
I'm a good man
But all these good men get treated like shit
Our friends callin' at 3:30 in the morning
Marcus don't wanna talk about no numbers
Marcus wanna talk about that ass
And I ain't havin' it
Ya got someone to talk to
These women, because they need to be told
I twenty you better
Talk to 'em

Get your money right, ladies
Tell the man to get gone
But don't you show up to my crib with your period on
This is lesson one, baby
Listen, how should I begin?
Ain't no such thing as a platonic friend
You're lying to yourself if you don't think you want more
So don't you call me insecure when he show up at your door
You all claim to have substance, self-respect, and some class
But half-naked in the club, and steady shaking your ass
Screamin' I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt
But who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth?
I'm on the streets and you trippin' I don't make you feel safe
I stay at home and you complaining that you think we need space
I'm that sayin' that it's fair, but that's the way that it is
Ain't no nigga tryin' to marry you with four or five kids
It may sound a little harsh, but it's straight from the heart
A nigga didn't write the scripts, so I'm just doin' my part
Yeah

Preach, my brother, preach
All you women out there heard that
And you better believe they did
And some millions of people listening
That's our show for this year
Good ladies and gentlemen
I got to get a piece of ass my damn self

One day I love you, the next I can't stand you
Huh, it's too much for me to handle
I made my mind up thinkin' I'm on the right track
So then I leave you, but then come right back
And I don't like that, I swear I'm so confused
Don't know what I want or what's the right thing to do
But the right thing is you, you're my destiny
Even at my worst you still bringin' out the best in me
But then you testin' me, know how to push my buttons
Fussin', fightin, yeah we always gettin' into somethin'
So mad I make you cry, then we make love
A never-endin' cycle, make up to break up
It's time to wake up, I need to smell the coffee
Play with these other women, or get 'em all off me
And you wonder why your man'll just doubt ya

I can't live with ya, can't live without you
I say I can't live with you, can't live without you

Findin' the smallest things just to start an argument
Goin' through my phone, know you shouldn'ta took it though
I hope your stupid ass find what you're lookin fo'
Stormin' out the house mad, throwin' breakin' shit
Callin' your girls, exaggeratin' and fakin' shit
Pack your clothes like you really 'bout to leave this time
Know you messed up but actin like it's me this time
It's a revolvin' door, that keeps spinnin' 'round
Are we gon' be together, or are we finished now?
And you wonder why your man'll just doubt ya
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya

When the going get tough and the fightin' be rough
Now some folks may call it hood but I guess we call it love
I be askin' for your touch then I don't give you my trust
First I hate you with a passion then I can't need you enough
I be, wantin' to spend my whole life wit'chu
And I be, talkin' 'bout how you and me are through
And my mind says yes but my heart says no
And my mind says walk but my feet won't go away, yeah
See I be tellin' you to go
But deep inside I want you to stay
Uh, and you know how to make me smile
But at times you ruin my day

Got a text with a tongue out from a number I didn't recognize
I replied who is this
Quick back got a hit back
Said this is Stacy and I've been missing you
Had to change my number so I went and got a new phone and new tattoo
A what, a new tattoo wow,

Can you send a nasty pic

And I promise I won't show my friends (yeah right)

So I pull up to the club stunting in a yellow Lamborghini
Half bent, black tint, fine pussy make it a little hard to see me
Stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that you I see
Is that you papi
So I B-B-M'ed abbreviate yep and before the night gets too late
Let me hit you with a little Q and A
Can I tap that ass t-t-a

It's me plus one can I bring my friends

Share all your secrets, all your desires and your fantasies. 
I ain't gon' tell nobody, baby I'm an only child.
I'd keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile, 
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to ain't that what you want? 
I'll be your lover, your provider, and your confidant. 
And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect,
But you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it. 
I wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in, 
We could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when,
You like it rough I give it rough and I start to pull your hair,
Cause ecstasy's your destination and I'ma take you there,
Tell me a secret baby

Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows, 
And think about it just as soon as the door close. 
Tell me a secret baby,

And there ain't nobody in the universe that competes with you, 
Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do.

Handcuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name, 
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game. 
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be. 
And I got just what you want baby girl you want it,
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off. 
Just give me your body its guaranteed that I'ma
Break you off, off, off, off, off until the sun rise,
And I'm not here to disappoint just give me one try. 
One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,
Ne-Yo holla at 'em.

You've been looking so good all day
And you really got a n**** pretty anxious baby

Feeling high but I'm hung real low looking sorta like a tripod,
So power down your cell phone and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak
(yes, f***)
It's the only words that you finna speak
Its about to get real x-rated
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do
But enough about me let me think
Should I be worrying about if I can handle you
Damn right I'ma get that thing and I'ma put my name on it
All night I'ma whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
You could be my fire cracker, my tongue gon spark you up
Get ready for blast off, waterfalls gon splash off
You might lose around 4 or 5 pounds so get ready to sweat your a** off

Murder your sons, ravage your daughters
Here overseas and across the waters
Tanks and missiles
Bombs and grenades
Inject your land with guns and AIDS

Trying to get paid and you are too

And my city's got it, and their city's got it
This world is chaotic
And love is symbolic
So life don't get cherished,
So our babies perish, and your babies perish
Now tell me who's careless
Now who should I pray to
What should I pray for
You can't pay the preacher for your redemption
I know where we're headed
I already read it
The good book done said it (like cowboys and Indians)

But today I promise if we don't make our own way
Somebody'll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, lord help me please
Cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I'm bulletproof cocking the glock and aim n shoot
My future's ever clear 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of betta' days
Dreaming of betta' pay,
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta' pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep,

She drops that dress around her legs

Death by lyrical injection
I kill you rappers
A lot of green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay packer
I pack the zeros
Meaning mucho deniro
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades and they all get Knicked like Melo
Hello, Luda!
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumping, or playing double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

Let me tell this to the people not understanding my moxie
Animal, watch me
If you think it’s tangible, stop me
But then I hit ‘em with a flow, that they can’t even copy
See, we don’t play that
Where I’m from it’s like fantasy hockey
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for?
While you cuffin ‘em all, I’m stuffing her jaw
Then leave em for you to rebound Kevin Love on the boards
Dog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad
I put you on a crash course in a smart car
Gon' speeding not relying on the brake pad
The car you should only drive on the race track
So the lyings bout your feelings and your Maybach
Are ghost tails for the Phantoms face facts
We ruin hip hop, slaughterhouse and payback
In the shape of a tat, you done faded to black

I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind in the wrong direction
Now it’s time ya bow down and rep ? in my honor
Writ in my honor cause bitch I’m bonker, plural
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous girl
She on E, feeling on me, singing on key
While I’m bumping We Are The World
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn’t did he
“We run this town”
No he didn’t did he
I feel like tinting the glass,

I call her Mississippi, that was pretty witty

He ain't get it, did he?

Sticking it to the pedal
Pedal to the floor
Just whipping it through the ghetto
Metal in the door, case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I’m settling the score
I don’t know what ya'll hating for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don’t know what you’re waiting for
I ain't finna say nothing, turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneakers spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in his ear going na na na na na
Just when you think it stop na na na na na
Everything I speak is hot
But don't be mad at least everything you speak is
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay

Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I’m launching manure
Lord of the underground, God of the saw
On Hennessy black, ? to the jaw
Yeah I’m off the block
This ain't work, homie, I’m off the clock
I’m a syllable, Hannibal, killer cannibal
With a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West till I walk with Pac
We the two point 0 boys, Tiz, Crook, and Joe, Royce
New ghost Rolls Royce, pulled off the lot
Cock me, the only way you can stop me
I’m top seed, I pop green at mach speed
So watch me, if you haven’t seen the phenomenon
I spit fast as Lamborghini’s and Ramadan

We’re so furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey

If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life

I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life

For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life",Rest of My Life,2012

Look at what you found
I was lonely for some time

When it was hopeless, the decision is what you need
You better be ready to, be ready to jump

Jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street
Say jump, down on Jump Street

Don't be afraid to die
A lot of bad guys should be afraid to die
Got Schmidt, Jenko, the whole damn crew
Same ole same ole with a whole lot of new
You know there can't be love without antropain
It all goes hand in hand like yin and yang
In the city but I'm mothafuckin' sky high
Tryna find a new drug called wi-fi
Wait, we just here tryna find us
Schmidt went lookin', 'til he found love
Got his life sweet, bon appetit
Spring break, bitch, throw a party on the beach
Shit did change, but all that means
Is that your real friends don't ever leave
Will it ever be complete?
Jump Street won't ever cease",22 Jump Street [Theme from the Motion Picture],2014
Ludacris,"When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavors?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go",Burning Bridges,2014
Ludacris,"I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had h*** and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
'Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me",Good Lovin,2014
Ludacris,"Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Now when I own over 15 million in real estate
And bought all The Fast & Furious trucks
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the reasons family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta's house, why?

I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumbass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at your own lives
'Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
(What am I here for?)
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinking I got that ""do what the fuck I wanna do money""
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money
Is gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-fi movies, the fans said this album is overdue
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Usher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, ""don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base""
I said, ""man, my female fan base gon' be here forever""
'Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God and a life jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answer everything that I pray for

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die",In My Life,2014
Ludacris,"Yeah, I'm ready to do it all over
My heart colder, hip-hop I'm part owner
Southern rap specialist, verses intelligent
Elegant, it's Ludacris, don't ever question my relevance
No pun intended, if no one's offended, get offended
Don't get it twisted, guns can get extended
Ready to die for my respect, my value, my worth
Unequivocal, lyrical beast on every fuckin' verse

I throw the curse just to stretch the emotions
Somebody said I'm washed up, I told 'em pass me the lotion
'Cause the industry's dryin' up and these verses are moisturizer
Then hand me your favorite rapper and Luda will posterize him
I'm dunkin' over you critics, dozin' off when I'm spittin'
My fans locked behind these bars, I put my life in a sentence
Good riddance, I wake 'em up if they step to the plate
'Cause sleep's the cousin of death and I could never relate
Luda!

See the only people I owe my loyalty to are the ones who made me question it.
Loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person
To the point when they no longer give a fuck.
There comes a time in life where you walk away
From all the drama and the people who create that shit.
Destroy what destroys you!
You'll never see all the great things ahead
If you keep looking at all the bad things behind you.
They say the hardest things in life is know
Which bridge to cross and which ones to burn.
So may the bridges I burn light yo motherfuckin' way!
(So what's the number one cause of all these problems?)",New Beginning Intro,2014
Ludacris,"They say ""Luda, would you rather have the money or the fame?""
And I steady try to tell 'em that it all just depends
'Cause every time I make a little more money I seem to be losin' more of my friends
So I'd give it all up to repeat life over and they'd say ""Dude is a fool""
I can't trust another motherfucker livin' in this world and this really got me losin' my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation
And the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up?
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle and the Conjure would have you fucked up
So I'm lookin' for love in all the wrong places, pop pills, drink liquor by the cases
Get high, make a woman get low, in the strip club lookin' for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis but all they ever really want's my cash
""Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars and you know that I'm a pay you back"", my ass
This world so superficial, this world done lost my trust
They say ""Ludacris, you changin'"" but I really don't give a fuck!
What the hell am I suppose to think? What the hell am I suppose to do?
I'm hearin' that the Devil's in disguise and I'm hearin' that the nigga look just like you
They know I walk throw the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I don't go astray
And I get down on my knees and pray and I say

(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away

Doc say I need to change my diet, cause I'm really not eatin' right
Mama said I need some peace and quite, cause I'm really not sleepin' right
What's the use of havin' all the money and the power in the world if I can't abuse it?
Seems like the, only thing that's, keepin' me together is my music
If it wasn't for that I think I would lose it; if it wasn't for that I would go crazy
When nobody make good on they word and the industry'd make you feel like fuck you pay me
'Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me
That still lookin' for a hand out, 'til you found out that there ain't shit ya handed me
Hah, still mad at me? But I'm tryin' to be the man I plan to be
But can't do it if you callin' me for dumb shit, thinkin' it's innocent, I'm a plea insanity (ohh!)
Too many distractions, and it feels like everyday
So I get down on my knees and pray and I say

(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away

I finally made it to the top of the CEO position
But when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions
So the weed keep me at peace and I think I need an intervention
Who the fuck put me in charge of makin' all of these decisions?
My position got me stressin' like it never did before
Not to mention my best friend drowned and death was knockin' at his door
And it seems like someone in my family is passin' away like everyday
So I just look up to the sky and get on my knees and pray and I say!

But tell him Ludacris is thankful for his daughter

Hut one, hut two, hike, hike, hike
They don’t know about the scratches on my back
And how I call you my bed bug when you bite, bite, bite, bite
Nibbling and dribbling, feeling all of my adrenaline
Tasting like cinnamon, I can think of so many synonyms
You be killin them, other women, be pretending
That they don’t know that you really hardcore like Lil’ Kim and them
Squat down, bend it over, bring it back,
From the side, turn around hunch back, Notre Dame

Listen close, nigga, yeah

Uh, if rappers want it, they can get it
Flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin' in a Civic
My flows are unimaginable, Hannibal Lecter shit
Eatin' emcees for breakfast, bitch
Since I was born to touch the mic
The first time it's been a problem
Your life was a mistake
Your pops should've wore a condom
You niggas think you hard
I think you better come harder (Go hard)
I leave rappers confused like will.i.am barber
Ah, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look
A verse'll make your fans unfriend you on Facebook
Click, my styles are goin' into labor
So if stars won a war, I made daddy like Darth Vader
And since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me
For over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me
And a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist
Cause to fit 'em in one garage is like a nigga playin' Tetris
But they say patience is a virtue
Cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew
Guess I was a thief that got away with these words
Slangin' chickens out my whip like I been playin' Angry Birds
In a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman
Everywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man
And I sleep with the John Dillinger
And always keep an eye half-open like Forest Whitaker
No, you boys ain't ready for combat
Be more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract
What path is he on? Opponents, I laugh and be gone
They handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath & Beyond
But in the midst of all the melee
Y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh
Your rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead
And I be on them lines like a nigga just played
Guess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate
You wouldn't know the real me if your bitch Wikipedia'd it
Just know that I never tried to be hard
Probably cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard
You'll get chopped like judo
Gangs in my hood make you reverse
And change your color like the block's playin' Uno
And, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs
But I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud
They show me love
That's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me
Rappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me
I hereby command all my fans' to inject it
Overdose on Red Bull in your veins if you ever slept on me
Yeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine
All the knives extended from the knuckles of Wolverine
Not a X-Man, but, man, I got that X
I'm on my hardest, switch labels, but I still get a cheque
The more albums they sell, the more we all win
And I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin
Or watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS
I plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS
I changed my music up cause I was gettin' bored
You may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board
My name still engrained and these books will be the outcome
And this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums

Now back to basics
Back to Adidas with the fat laces
Back to the Ac' where I'm riding to the track in the track, get it straight nigga, no chases
Age ain't nothing but a number, Luda rapping like he just turned 24
Any rapper wanna forget who I am every now and then I see I gotta let em know
Yo must I remind you
You rap like something behind you
Got paid, but your heart pump Kool Aid
Cover Girl make up should have signed you
But it's never too late
15 years, nigga, never too great
4 years off getting Hollywood checks, but you niggas want beef and you looking like steak

I see that liquor got you loose

I'll make you niggas loose a tooth
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm the truth
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
Now I'm like, fuck calling a truce
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth

Never fuck with a nigga who got some kids
'Cause when you talk about me, then you talk about them
Then I gotta come where you live
You takin' food out they mouth, now I gotta put a fist in yours
I don't play about my hustle
A nigga got all these acres
All my neighbors think I'm flipping them birds
Naw, but I be flipping these words
Anything you hear me saying I could back up
And you talk so tough on the mic
But whenever you in sight, nigga, something don't add up
Put your money where your mouth is
WAIT, put a GAT where your blouse is
You think it's funny cus it's sunny where your house is
Bitch, I'll put my muddy ass boots where your couch is (Fuck yo couch)
I live this shit, you know you do this just for show, nigga
You act as if Ludacris just came and took your ho, nigga
You's a ho, nigga, yeah I said it twice

Where do I begin
Well, the industry shady not everybody is your friend
I had to learn that shit the hard way
In and out bogus contracts since before I was rapping in the hallway
Everyone out for money, executives out for blood
If you don't keep the music current then labels'll pull the plug (get it)
Hard to admit when shit don't go the way you plan
While everybody's on instagram just fronting like life is brand
Take it back to one of my first tours
Fuckin' everything movin' thinkin' groupies will never do nothing back to us
Kick 'em out the hotel swearing I hit my finer things
Lost a bunch of jewelry from a rolex to a diamond chain (bitch)
How in the hell did I get caught slippin'
Meanwhile on all my records, nigga talkin' bout he pimpin'
Maybe I exaggerated a lil bit
You know fake it till you make it every one of us rappers gotta talk a little shit
Yeah I done smashed some video vixens and some actresses
But brand name pussy don't feel no different on my matresses
Insecure hoes with brest jobs and butt shots
Blaming on us rich niggas sponsoring shit and what not
Now guys are just as big as groupies as these women is
Till you break up and a bitch wonder where her percentage is
While these regular hoes are trying to play the trap game
And now is the time I blame it on the rap game

Listen, this ain't scripted this reality
It take some drugs for us to conquer this insanity
Thieves using our name promoting these fake appearances
Publicists overcharging taking years for these clearances
I got sued some rappers said I stole their joint nigga
Spend half a million just to prove a fucking point nigga
We got the fans thinking rappers never lose
Gave a producer a hundred grand for a beat I never use (damn)
The false stories and being misquoted in magazines
Got a nigga wanting to go and load a couple magazines
Head to your office and shoot up the whole fucking staff
Post that on your website and burn while I fucking laugh
You protesters at my concerts y'all make me sick
I thought I told y'all I would never disrespect a bitch
It's clear to see that hip hop's under attack man
Or is it cause that no one wants to see a rich black man
Really they want us with no money
Hungover and missing flights and cutting our show money
Hip hop cops still looking and trying to catch us slippin'
And put us in a position to make some real life decisions (hmmm)
Or do we just be doing dumb shit
Emptying out these gun clips and always on the run shit
Lifestyles of us entertaining hood niggas

But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun
Knowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one

Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too
Hanging out the window front and central like a late-night Wendy's drive through
Tweeters, speakers, jeekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga
I got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl in return of the mack, my nigga

It's the return of the 'Lac
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo
Fleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate
And all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake

Last to base, in the face

My rims are too large
As soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me

I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk
Cause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard
My wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, lord

I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on
My seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette

007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho
I got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho
Neon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho
Young and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho

Like a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom

Back to rap then starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends, let the story begin

Always searching for another high

Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying

The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high

Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)

Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think

Murdering the rapper and killing beats nigga!
I'm cinematic making everybody panic

We can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover
in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga
They sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!
One time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!
Anybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!
You lame
And my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day
They say Luda don't want it no mo'
No nigga I'm as hungry as the first day
What you want how you want it you can get
I'm the definition of a real g from the south side
The crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape
and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline
I'm all about mine
Getting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back
Used be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy, outcast like three stacks
Laying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone
giving me dome my music on with the seats back
Ludacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight
Even if a nigga leak that
Timmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack
in the back like ""Damn Luda freak that!""
Break it down like you dropping to the ground
but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back
Sample had to eat that
Couldn't control all of the leader
But put any other rapper on the track and
I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that
I'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend Imma drill it in your head till you dose off
And I just so happen to be the type of rapper
that make your women want to take her clothes off
So let's get to the action
Let's get to the show
I'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'

Let me get it back

Ever since I
Came in the game it ain't never been the same
Can't nobody do it like me
Is it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely
Knowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame
So fuck call to call we can go bar for bar
I'll put your name up on the wall of shame
And everyday is the same thing
Looking for another way for me to make paper
I think it's time for every single rapper to go to church
Whoever is my opponent you better pray first
They like ""Luda why you rapping so fast?""
I'm like ""Bitch why you listen too slow?""
I'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up
hardly cause I always hit em with a new flow
And the two door with the coup low with the Hublot
off the window with the two low
Blades from the top like judo listening to Bruno on the way to school though
Getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though
Cuz I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes
When it come to fluke hoes cuz some of they pussy bite like Kujo
But back to the you know who
I can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest

Unsigned, performing at every open mic

And all the bright lights never blinded out my vision
Music was my passion and my first crush

Head in the clouds to trace my observations
Just connect the dots to all of the constellations
Looking for signs that's astrological
And I don't dream big, my dreams are astronomical

I wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominal
Hiding from life's daily distraction
Where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
And I'm attracted to money and beautiful women

But turbulence is non stop till the flights over
So when passengers panic just stay silent
And realize its never too late to become the pilot
I fly higher take control of my destiny
The first step I needed me to invest in me
It's still a every day struggle for wealth
But rather struggle working for me than working for someone else
And I'm steady tryna ease the stress
So I open up all the doors with the key to success
If it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first

Got enough sorrow for a lifetime
'Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen
When he was seldom in his right mind
My early years I was too young to understand
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all them empty cans
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments
Hands off my momma, somehow knew he was the cause of it
Got a little older and he got a little worse
Drinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed

But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle

Yeah, I lost my father to the bottle
Functioning alcoholic's what they call it far as I know
Became a teenager and started to understand
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
So before the hospital, where the paramedics rushed him
Any and everybody who met him, instantly loved him
Ironic how conjure would have made him even sicker
'Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor
And tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?
He had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage
Tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his paps

Tell your parents you love 'em
You might not see 'em tomorrow!
I swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside
But I feel so hollow inside
Gotta keep my eyes on the prize
'Cause I'm steady wishing you were here
To see the goals that I plan to reach
You left the day after I put you in my Grammy speech
It's almost like you waited just to see me win
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet!

Michael sending me Jordans every 1st of the month
Said his kids love me, ain't paid for a pair of kicks since
Why is it that when 'em niggas gettin' rich
The whole world just wanna get you some free shit? (Hahah)
Ain't that 'bout a bitch
Especially when they told me I'll never do shit, or be shit
I made it and never took you for granted
Took off and I never landed, supply whatever demanded and no one's ever handed it to me
I kicked it off with me and my special team and shot the [?] to me
Touchdown on my old turf, money and bitches sucking me in my microphone vest
And know I'm not surprised that my old [?] taking niggas to school, go do your homework

Almost everyday I'm waking up in another city
Another country, a different climate and a time zone
Jet lag but I'm out of the bed fast for bad foreign bitches that I'm eager to lay my eyes on
So I opened up the blinds to the sky on
Wish that I could talk to God on my iPhone
I thank Him for all of his generosity
And for satisfying most of my curiosity
Fans asking me what it's like to be me
I always tell 'em it's more good than bad
They say I want what you got
I tell 'em you'll never have shit if you don't appreciate what you have

Now my passport needs additional pages
Then I'm staring out at another horizon
Staying fly even in the no fly zone
Bodies on board but my mind's gone
Ain't no better feeling than when I fly home
Staring out the window of the plane in the rains even the clouds need a shoulder to cry on
I'm crying cuz I'm living out my dreams
But this life is not easy as it seems
It's sorta similar to a crack game
Ain't no slowing down when you living in the fast lane

And we have a responsibility to live it
From the first breath to the last
Our future is built on the foundation of our past
Experience is a professor, and its test's at a highest pressure
While we can't afford to crack
We must bear not to break
Like a reed in the wind we go with the flow
While still reaching for the light
Avoid useless conflict while never running from the fight
The struggle that forever brought me to just beneath the surface
I'm dedicating to the service of self and to my people
And to never feeding the beast of unnecessary evil
We say the motion of [?]
Take the action to display our character
From the first second that we start to feast until the day that we break this barrier
So disparaging is a civilized savage only strive to become average
I'm not happier as a maverick
A cowboy that uses his cabbage to get more green than most millions done seen
The good kind and never the bad bitch
The best that life has to give are the blessings of this life that we live
And everyday I'm [?] not lose my way I've had to learn

Eu disse que não ia mais te escutar (it's tough, babe)
Nem tenta mentir, que eu sei que 'tava lá
Solto no rolê, eu paguei pra ver

Suas roupas eu larguei no portão (shit)
Desculpa, mas perdi o tesão
Sai dessa casa e vaza
Não me atrasa

Já é tarde pra me procurar
Ninguém vai me segurar
Senta e assiste o meu show
Que hoje eu vou tocar o terror

Vai embora
Ih, vai embora

Você perdeu o jogo
Se prepara pra faxina
Eu vou passar o rodo
E te limpar da minha vida
Te falo mais uma vez pra que você entenda
Ministério da Saúde não me recomenda

Vem que hoje eu 'to na maldade
Com um toque de crueldade
Vai me ver quicar até tarde
É teu choque de realidade

For keeping it to yourself

Gotta give it give it give it or else

You can't beat the heat that beats in my blood.

All the muffins that a man could desire
But I'm not gonna give up all the money
'Til ya admit you wanna sit by the fire
