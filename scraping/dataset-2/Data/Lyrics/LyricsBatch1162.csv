The Muffs,"Some afternoon tea
And that will do it for me
Did I conceive you
Or are you talking to me

And I will read my mind instead
And I could tell you
That you are very dead

I walk around town
And stare although I am blind
Maybe I'm patient
Or am I out of my mind

And I will read your mind instead
And I could tell you 
That you are very dead
You are not well read

If I could stay awake
Or at the very least pretend
In every way I'm feeling gone
Without this day I can't go on

(Repeat Chorus)",My Crazy Afternoon,1997
The Muffs,"I believed you baby
I don't know why
I believed you baby
Now I know

[Chorus]
I know it you know
Do they know it too
You know you may be right
You may be nothing now

Didn't want to see
Don't want to know why
Didn't want to leave
Don't want to go

Lying away 
Now I see it now you go",Nothing,1997
The Muffs,"I'm pathetic now
Want to take a ride with me
To another place
With my funny face

And if you say everything is alright
When you look in my eyes
Do I look away or am I telling lies
Do you know where I am
I really want you to
I'm here in outer space

Welcome to my world now
By myself but I don't care
If you think I'm funny
Talk to me when I'm not there

You won't get a lot out of me
I really want you to see
That I'm wasting away in a fantasy
Do you know where I am
I really want you to
I'm here in outer space

Well here I go again now
I might as well be dead
Why should I be living
When it's all in my head
Where should I go?
Where maybe baby I notice it (woo!)

And if you say",Outer Space,1997

You can do it so much better

The Muffs,"You play follow the leader
And I don't understand
Why you want to spend your life
With that awful man

And he wants you for one thing
And some more if he can
Now you want to spend your life
With that awful man

And he doesn't mean it when he says he loves you so
Dedicated to himself as if you didn't know

The Muffs,"And I said hello
I ran into you the other day
And you looked away

Another halo
The only thing you're gonna need
If you want to be

Another face and you're inviting
But you're frightening
And it's only make believe
When you're upside down

Another playboy
You wanted to think you're really something
But you're really nothing

Ever dayglo
You're probably all in disarray
Nothing much to say

A candy face and paint by numbers
Even dumber
And it's only make believe
When you're upside down

Candy's wanting you and now I can't take it
Candy's wanting to now please don't fake it

The Muffs,"Come on and hate me
If you dare like every mothers son
Good riddance to you
All I say it had to be done

And now I'm out of here
You ask me where you'll never know
Into a place where only I could go

You'll never see me ever again
I bet you don't care
And I will be much better off
Without you there

And if I close my eyes I'll see
It's where you'll never know
Into a place where only I could go

I never lie
Only blame ok
You'll figure out
You're ashamed any day

Yeah I don't even know

And I don't even know for sure

How I do anything
I'm looking at the floor, I'm looking at the floor
But I don't care much anymore

I'm looking out behind the curtains
And frowning out behind my smile
Yeah this is how I pass the time

Will I go anywhere
I do not rightly know, do you think I should know
Since I don't even think I'll go

I'm laying here in my own bile
I'm gonna be here for a while

",How I Pass the Time,2004
The Muffs,"

I'm here I'm not completely broken in a state
I'm here I'm gone and maybe I could complicate
The way I'm describing it a million thoughts I wallow in
Are flying in out of me and faster still

All day all time I'm following my crooked mind
I know I'm done for looking at the wicked fun
All through my old funny face I'm in a lonely place
I'm going round the bend
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I could stand here looking at this wall all day
Listening to my thoughts racing faster faster

All day insane I'm feeling nothing but the pain
Of this I know
That staring at this wall is no way to be enjoying it
Pathetic but it's true
Oh I'm thinking about you
Oh yeah I'm thinking about you
Ooh ooh ooh oh
I'm thinking about being here with you





",I'm Here I'm Not,2004

I can't fall asleep I wanna try
The only way I'll sleep is if I die

I need a little luxury
Put your arms around me
And I'll feel better naturally

Wide awake and thinking about you

I need a little luxury
Put your arms around me
And I'll feel better naturally

I'm afraid that I care and I want you there

",A Little Luxury,2004

My eyes are complaining
The one I see is you
Maybe if I poke them out
Then I won't be so blue

I can hardly stand it
And maybe if I scream
Only when I'm slowly running
In my awful dream

Boy meets girl and often
They do not agree
But they go ahead and marry
Who could be less free

I am not complaining
Me I'm just a freak
Only when I'm slowly running
In my awful dream

And when I wake up on the other side
I'll tell everyone
A secret cannot hide

I am not complaining
And maybe if I scream

Only when I'm slowly running

Runaway to a place I love
Where I hide away from you
And your old face
Telling me that you know me better

Who just didn’t want to change the show
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels
He liked icicles and snow

He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears
And critters and creatures that crawled
Why bugs were some of his very best friends
Spiders and ants and all

Now that’s not to say that he ever looked down
On a vision of twinkled lights
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes
And a thousand other delights

And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer
And a jolly old man in a sleigh
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things
And a story of Christmas Day

Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright
He was full of Christmas cheer
All of each and every day
And all throughout the year

To him it was more than a special time
Much more than a special day
It was more than a special story, it was more than a beautiful story
It was a special kind of way

You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring
And they’ve never heard of Santa Claus
They’ve never heard the story of the Son of God
That made Alfie pause

Did that mean that they’d never know of peace on Earth
Or the Brotherhood of Man
Or know how to love, or know how to give
If they can’t no one can

You see, life is a very special kind of thing
Not just for a chosen few
But for each and every living, breathing thing
Not just me and you

So when you’re at Christmas prayers this year
Alfie asked me if I’d ask you
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood
And those who live there too

It's in every one of us to be wise. 
Find your heart, open up both your eyes.
We can all know everything without ever knowing why.

There goes Mr. Sneer

His anger makes that clear
Don't ask him for a favor 'cause his nastiness increases

No cheeses for us meeses

          Christmas is a time to come together, a time to put all differences aside.
                     And I reach out my hand to the family of man 
                       to share the joy I feel at Christmas time.

         For the truth that binds us all together, I would like to say a simple prayer.
                That at this special time, you will have true peace of mind
                     and love to last throughout the coming year.

                And if you believe in love, that will be more than enough
                     for peace to last throughout the coming year.

Well, way up north where the air gets cold,
there's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told.
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red,
and he spends the whole year working out on his sled,
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.

Just a little bobsled, calls it old Saint Nick,
But he sparks the buggy with a full speed stick.
He's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel,
Then he gives gas and just watch him peel, yeah,
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.

Run run reindeer, run run reindeer, run run reindeer,
run run reindeer, run run run, yeah!

He's rolling through the snow at a frightful speed
with a half dozen deer with Rudy to lead.
He's gotta wear his goggle cause the snow really flies,
and he's cruising every path with a little surprise,
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.

The Muppets,"A frosty Christmas Eve, when the stars where shining
I traveled for the home, where westward falls the hill
And for many, many a village, in the darkness of the valley
Distant music reached me, peels of bells were ringing.

Then spread my thoughts to olden times, to that first of Christmases
When shepherds who were watching, heard music in the fields
And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell
Whether it were angels, or the bright stars a-singing

But to me heard a far, it was starry music
The singing of the angels, the comfort of our Lord
Words of old that come a traveling, by the riches of the times
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill

The light that shines for all to see

the promise that silenced 1000 fears
A faith that can hobble an ocean of tears

All the clouds are taught to fly
As our souls will leave this land most peacefully
Though our minds be filled with questions
In our hearts we'll understand
When the river meets the sea

Like a flower that has blossomed
In the dry & barren sand
We are born & born again most gracefully
Thus the winds of time will take us
With a sure and steady hand
When the river meets the sea

Patience, my brother and patience, my son
In that sweet and final hour
Truth and justice will be done

Like a baby when it is sleeping
In its loving mother's arms
What a newborn baby dreams is a mystery
But his life will find a purpose
And in time he'll understand
When the river meets the sea
When the river meets the almighty sea!!

I like taking things apart

Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star

Now’s your chance to save your hide
Gentlemen, I did not know
It’s a crime to steal the show

Tell us how the art was taken
If you want to save your bacon
I haven’t seen your missing art
All I've stolen is audience hearts

We can give you a plea deal
All you have to do is squeal
I’m not a thief, I don’t know how
All I've ever taken is a bow

We’ll catch the swine that did this job
Give up the pig puns, creep
Go jump in a lake, that’s my suggestion
Thank you Piggy, no more questions

I think she likes me
I don’t think your puns are helping the investigation
You know, I think they did it
No they didn't
Yes they did, and we can pin it

If they did, how did they do it
If they didn't, how did they didn't
If they didn't then it’s easy, ’cause they simply didn't do it
If they did it, then I knew it, but we've nothing that can prove it

Oh, excuse me
Uh
Bring in the purple guy with the shnozz
Do you remember what you did
On the night you played Madrid?

I was hit by a raging bull
And rushed off stage to the hospital
Gonzo, what do you know
About the sculpture theft at Madrid’s Prado
I never saw the stolen busts
I spent the night in bed concussed

The truth Gonzo, the clock is tickin’
If you don’t believe me, ask the chicken
Camilla was there, she’ll co-operate
Madam, are you willing to corroborate

Bawk bawk begawk, begawk gawk gawk
Will someone get this chicken out of here
Calm down Camilla, it’s a routine inspection
Thank you Gonzo, no more questions
Let’s go from the start
What do you know about the stolen art

I didn't know there was a plan
Your accusation is far out man
The chances of us committing a crime
Are less than .009

Shern de shern de herf
Sher de chicky en de farney hug

To help with our investigation
Can you do a full translation

What the chef just said to you
Was schnoop do schnnop do schnook
It’s not Swedish

Argh
Wank wank wank
I can do an Elvis impression

Thank you Muppet's,no more questions
They didn't
No, they didn't
There’s no way they did the crime
They couldn't they’re too stupid
They’re not criminal masterminds

We do not know who did it, but we know who didn't do it
So we know who didn't do it yes we know who didn't do it
They’re incapable of being culpable",Interrogation Song,2014
The Muppets,"This is my dream come true
The day has come for us to say I do
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Nothing in the world means more to me than you

I've waited so patiently
I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It's written in the stars, it's destiny

So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you

We'll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They'll learn to say hello, and say goodbye
We'll grow grey and old, and live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we'll stay together
Forever and ever

So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you

How can something so right feel so wrong inside
How can something so good, leave me feeling so bad
How can my dreams coming true, leave me lonely and blue
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad
How can I feel the high when I feel so low

After all we've been through after coming so far
Is this my destiny
Meep meep meep meep meep mee
Where is the love that's written in the stars

How can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you",Something So Right,2014

Fearless through to fall
He walks with danger
I'm not alone
He makes me feel strong
Not afraid to face the day
When the world comes down
And the thunder strikes
Counting down the hours
Through the poring rain
And the burning flames
He's my hero
'Til the world remains
A much safer place
I look at the horizon
As the world comes down tonight

Watching out for harm
To keep me guarded
He will not be seen
But I know he's there
I'm not alone

Ayyo dim the lights on my shit son

That why'all, It's murda

Respect a thug, or accept a slug
Or accept the death of somebody you love
That's the rules we live by, ways I kiss by
We all murderers in the eyes of all ours
So when I pull a bubble up and back in your car
When I spit sixteen's you gonna wish they was sparks
Can you hold something, you can hold heat you can keep
Slugs in your sleep while I'm plugging your freak
I'm the thug of the week, the killer of the millennium
Spitting like mack ten and a nine ??
Blasting off like Flex on New Years
Who cares how many slugs why'all spit in the air
Niggaz over here got glock nineteen's, P89's, hollow points, and M16's
Three fifty-seven's and mack11's 
We clap you come to the funeral...

Motherfucker if your holding them ?? nigga
Then I'd advise nigga, we rip the high niggas
Don't matter the size niggaz
Ever since I popped up, a lot of niggaz done got stuck
While I'm laying the cut, meant that's rocked up
Believe it's murda
Niggaz get popped up, buried and chopped up
We don't give a fuck if the cops get touched
A ?? and a baby blue drop
With a stash box holding a fifth and two glocks
And every sixteen I spit I ??
And won't stop firing, firing until I got, a four full of money
And playboy you bunny
Yo you get us a clip of hollow tip slugs from me
Bitch nigga, acting out the life of a thug money
I hustle and, grind those block for drug money
And make sure, kept counting every stack
We drop bombs like Flex and Big Kap

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Oh why must children die
I guess the lil' nigga want the piece of the pie, let 'em die
Oh why must thug niggaz snitch
I guess the lil' nigga thought he'd get a lil' rich, lil' bitch 
That's why we don't talk quick
'Cause niggaz who talk quick get killed for the bricks
This is it, that's why we walk with our guns
'Cause those without guns get killed by guns

?? the one that will kill you son
It's the same where ever we from, it's the slums
We spit guns, lay you down for the 1
I love when niggaz talk slick with they tongue
You ain't buying no one, you talking shit
I'm from the place get killed for shit
So fuck where you from, better start from day 1
It's amazing...


Murda mommy in every song
You was warned, should of listened when I told ya
It's coming to a closure
And almost over now
Go to war like a solider now
And you rat broads running my style, I'm shutting you down
From N.Y. to L.A., Vi-ta from Jersey
More of a bitch then a lady
Chase chips, slick bitch
With flows that's sick, and it only gets worse...

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Murda, is the way of the walk
And since I walk a thin line, I'm looking at niggaz with dead eyes
And I'm baptized, my body has sinned
A lil' weed, a few hoes, and a whole lot of head
Got me hollering, I don't give a fuck!
About nothing at all, front
I'm blasting off, killing you with probable cause
'Cause you probable of thinking that you hotter then I
It will never be until I die, and touch the sky
Hells angel, fly
I feel like I'm at war fighting for my inner self fighting for my life
This world made me a, Murderer
May the lord take you, before I murder ya
Bodies turning up, and who you think got 'em all touched

How does it feel to take a life

It's murda and its not a game
Y'all gonna feel the flames and a lotta pain
Let me explain from day one its murda one with no gun
Taking income, makin bitch niggas run
The nine-one-one roll up nigga what
We got the four pund tucked, the Porsche look plush
Niggas get fuckin clapped and killed for flossin
That probly why niggas get killed so often
Nothin' to live for type a nigga I did a bid for
Snitch bitch niggas that ain't built for war
Is it because we ain't got no love for thugs
And slugs for drugs, the worlds most murda'rous
Black Child, nigga you know how the fuck I do
Put two in you, then puff a blunt at your funeral
I might touch yo' click and fuck yo' bitch
But'choo never heard a nigga spit shit like this

[Chorus]

When I'm gunnin' I'm coming on ??? shit rubber grip
Four shit on the sawed off, blowin' the doors off the Range Rov' shit
Fo'  sho' this, is somethin' we die for
And my murdera's I lie and fry for
Murda man, when the shit hit the fan
The plan formulate, for instance, fuck a percentage you need the all the cake
Put the four to snakes make 'em lay for raw
Fuck the game, 'cause nigga I don't play no more
Size 'em up, nevermind if you ridin' tough
Count 'em out 'til his eyes is puff, despising us
I got hungry thugs that'll tie you up
And they ain't got a problem with, snub nose revolver shit
We hard to hit, my mom's a Crip
We thristy niggas that'll rob ya bitch for the love of the chips
So when I'm soaking the whip, y'all niggas keep hatin'
Gotta stash where the heats placed in, paper I keep chasin'
Motherfucker, uh uh

[Chorus]


Yo, yo
Forever young this face kills so many all die, nigga must I?
Confess my sins, to the souls of the unknown, why?
Would you ever disrespect my niggas
We murderous engines that lead to lynchin's
Index, itching, ready to run up and hit 'em
Let the teflon spin 'em, they say ""look how Ja did 'em""
I a murder'a , Inc'ed and blood you know you heard of us
Murderers juts because we the shh
Make a nigga much harder to hit with the ox
We can take it back, give me five minutes in the box
Or trade hot rocks 'til one of us drops
Nothin but shells and you can hear the shot for blocks
I'm giving 'em hell, while niggas steady hollerin' ""stop""
I spit sixteens with aim and continue to pop

As long as the love with me
Hoods will never forget me 
I could put raps in them, and shine up the city
Like elected Frank Nitty, jot a Big Poppa
For reasons of, we run up in a big truck and pop ya
Midnight opera
Over the wheels, slug body marks, and pop up
  
Seem like y'all niggas ain't never gon' learn
Either you hitting, or the nigga getting hit
'Cause son, when I click and cock, my shit gon' pop
And never been, a small nigga 
Always a score nigga

Stand up niggas will have you sitting in chairs with wheels on them
And that murder shit, I'm still on it
Murder for life
Give a fuck if you a accept it
You better respect it, unless it's, one of my fam' members
Leave whoever into this involvement in legal tendency
Laying where the dirt be
You dig this
Better recover with some big shit
Or duck when this fifth spit
  
Another question: Is you willing to die 
Just as much as you want to kill?
  
I went from handcuff recovering 
Blowing up from bubbling
Shot muscling
All my checks doubled in
Fuck tussling
Word to God
Got a hundred men, with guns and tems
And we love Mack-10's
Since the sex, got a nigga blushed with me
Got a nigga wet
Dropped the lex 
Copped the tech

We out to get the decimals
Don't know about the rest of you
You fucking with professionals
Murderers, that will split your juggle up
Motherfucker I'll cut ya
And you think Tah touch ya
Then we flip shit with bitches that ride all day
And niggas that get head, on the highway
And niggas hating 
To see Satin
Or be played
I'm gon' tell yo' hoe, you in hell waiting
While niggas on Earth
Flossed like they first
For what it's worth
Murderers blast first
  
Niggas respect murder everywhere
It's the streets
Nobody's dancing in the streets
Huh, the streets is ours man, murder
  
Nigga, it's so hard to say good-bye
I wonder why
Take a sneak peak kissing herbs on a high
Hah, I'm down for whatever, whenever
Murderers stick together
See Vita, be that chick to hard throb you nigga 
Fuck you, then rob you nigga
A grimy braud, that will set you and wet you
Leave you for my dogs to fetch you
Tie you up and wet you
Unless you, talking pacos again
It don't matter
The longer we spend, the longer we win
And Gotti, showed me how to work these niggas
??? these niggas
And hurt these niggas
And I'll be there, when my niggas need bail
Catch a body, take the stand, and won't tell
T-tale, I flip wholesale retail
Cheap, so you can get deep into this female
  
Gangstas and hoes are together
Don't let nobody tell you no different, man
It's the beginning of time
I love my bitches
  
Motherfucker it's on one
When I come through, niggas run
Niggas know
Equipped with guns, ya heard so
You get plugged up and gutted out
Found dead with a gun in your mouth
Now what you talking about?
Scold on these streets
I'm involved with thugs, who carry heat

Drinking milk shake and after that shit in your face
And let your bitch know there been a car bomb from the git
Blow the day you blow Shaq make all his free throws
Let him throw a finger fucking fast or slow
Even put it in your ass if you tell me so
Toe to toe, you can lose your deal and your hoe
Now it's hard to pay your carton note and buy you some smoke
Seen your man is 'convensary' now, he starting to worry
He said stay away from Bing and 118
They really put it down, really put niggas in the ground
And your really love me if you only got a beat down

Confidential, you need a whole lot of it
To bang with Bing in two bars, I can spoil your dream
Get mean, I could lead to things
Like me coming for you, in the middle of the night
With all black on, all you can see is the red light
The fo fo special got you hoping God bless you
Girl, won't forget you, once the bullets start the get you,
Games over soldier, don't you see the fucking Range Rover
With Bing in it, 10 more, 12th and 118 in it
I started rappin cause there's cream in it
But I still keep the crack, how for five or six fiends in it
A ring with the Bling Bling in it
And my brand new truck, bitches like the way I lean in it
Stop at the Stome, leave the keys in it
Gave you to leave with it, Bing will make you believe in it
You got a gut, put some trees in it

Need a hard rock between your legs, I see the red spot
Thug knot, all it takes is one shot to make your head rock
Take you out your spot
While in the Woodstock, ask about Bing on the block
Fuck the cop, sell crack in blue top
Niggaz the size of dimes, ya'll cowards must be outta ya mind
Thinking that Dave Bing won't shine
This ain't the first time I cut head wrong with 1 9
Find the lactose slope, mix it in with the coke
Buy a quarter pound weed and let the clock choke
Stuck the nine out, Stuck it down the bitch nigga throat
When it was least expected made him get buck-nagged

Motherfucker, the war is on, we're gonna pour it on
Niggas to be feminine, guns rapidly scenative
For the love of the Benjamins
Keep 'em leekin' an' bleekin' to dogs with his broads tremblin'
I'm sendin' him 'til the Lord, calls my adrenalin

You slow mo, niggas gettin' slow dough
Fuck your po'-po', I let the flow blow
Keep em' runnin' like Flo Jo, I flow so
Sickest murder, clip inserter, drop, pop an' rip your word up

We lust for more, can't touch crush the rope
Hit a club, then rush the door, niggas fuck the known
That's why we've been blazed, to you, froze it up
Had your name to the crease so you closed it up

I'm one in a mil, niggas got me gunnin' for real
Leavin' you nothin' to steal, so no pain to feel
So fuck the world, ya either get when you see the sink skin
No more than my thugs than your guns let off

I earned connections, every time I burn my weapon
Y'all niggas gonna learn your lesson
Fuck the Feds, nigga, we spit hollow heads
Our motto is 'Shed blood for dead thug'

That shed blood in hell, when my slugs set bail
Pray for death from your cell, I won't bet we got to jail
From pretty niggas with half a nickel flow
Them bitch niggas, they keep their dimes on the low

Y'all niggas is lame, commercial niggas, get out the game
We here now, shit's gonna change
We spit them things from point blank range at you
Then ask what the fuck you gon' do

Test the mic on your gun, lose your life an' your ones
I don't give a fuck where you from, niggas run when we come
I bust my gun 'cause I'm a bum from the gutter
You better know it's murda, motherfucker

Y'all ain't hear me, y'all with me
Throw your fuckin' fingers up, motherfucker
'Cause if y'all don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Nigga, I'm livin' my life, fuckin' your wife
Bendin' her up while I'm hollerin', “I don't give a fuck”
So I move like like it such and y'all can't get enough
Of The Murderers, it'll murda y'all, nigga, what, what?

I know y'all are ready to die, know why?
'Cause the pain is too much to bare while alive
So I cock my nine then close my eyes
Take another hit an' then creep an' blow minds

These are hard times, niggas, in these streets an' bust blind
Out of fear, out of despair but never in the air
We gonna take to this, point blank range in your Range Rov'
Pistol with the kids an' rape your stray hoe

We The Murderers, yo, what you expect from us?
We niggas you can't trust, that don't really give a fuck
We dedicated to street life, game an' hustle
I don't wanna be white, let them black an' live for struggle

My niggas tote guns for hittin' you an' your squad up
Now we got the upper hand, so keep your palms up
Niggas, if you want it with Ja, come in an' line up
Guaranteed you be meetin' your Maker, your times' up

Negative, I can go into the streets we live
Paper, foreign niggas be murderin' shit
So what, what? Niggas is holla, “Yo, what up?”
Murda Inc. is the movement that won't be touched

Motherfuckers, ya hear me? Murder Inc., niggas
'Cause if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

We don't give a what, what?
All of my ladies, it's all gravy
Get your tubs up, it's murder, turn it up
Plus, ain't nobody hotter than Totti, so who you ridin' with?
Ladies hatin' blatantly hatin''cause they ain't hidin'

Dismiss hot chick, straight to the top chick
That'll chase you, that'll strip you
Off your crown an' replace you
When I stay laced, boo, in the top of the line
In the finest designers, from Fendi an' Gabbana

Players, if you want it, I got it, just come an' get it
Thugs, if you hustlin', hustlin', come an' get it
Mommy, if you rollin' with Totti, let's get this dough off
We don't give a fuck, what?

The Murderers,"And now, the tale from the darkside... 
Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas 
What the flow is all about 
Huh, its about this 
Anywhere from forty-eight and up 
Straight, you feel me? 
Fifty fifty 

Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight? 
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet 
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace 
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me) 
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me 
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't want to make him show me 
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random 
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom 
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care 
'Cuz what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there 
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time 
that's why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme 
And that's mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had 
And I shouldn't have even done it, that's what made this shit sad 
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it 
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it 
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit [hits the fan] 
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man 
Then we gon' see what'choo made of 
If your shit ain't pumpin cool-Aid, what you afraid of? 
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head 
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead 
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in 
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen 
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong 
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on 
Keep gettin my groove on, 'cuz that shit could fuck with'choo 
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you 
Niggas try their luck with you, 'cuz they smell ass 
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast 
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery 
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME 
On this real, that's why a nigga stay writin 
'Cuz kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin 
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody 
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cuz I'm cruddy 
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas 
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas 
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for 
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for 
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip 
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip 
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops 
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block 
From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wild 
?Cell cagers last night from lock out just died? 
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run 
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done 
A mind is a terrible thing to waste 
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face 
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder 
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder 
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game 
'Cuz I'ma float off more tracks than they sixth train 
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT 
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2007

Because Esther's been searching for something
She doesn't quite know what it is
Yes Esther's been looking for something
Maybe something that doesn't exist
Esther, isn't it funny how we don't do the things we used to do?

The Mystic,"It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love.
So in love.
Once.
So in love.
Once.

She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I?ll never be nothing she wasn?t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn?t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn?t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

And if I had a chance to do it all over I?d do it exactly the same

I was a be-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it?s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that was fulfulling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn?t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let?s try again
But I wasn?t buying in
Didn?t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it?s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn?t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I?m a veteran what?s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she?s in disguise
And I just didn?t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we?re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I?m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I?ll see you in the wind

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

That?s right, baby
Next life time
Yeah, ain?t that what they say?

I got love for you

I ain't too proud to stay

But I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

With my soul sat down so tight it's like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you

I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind

To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing

Yes'n I try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad
To see you now with him
Is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can

And right there and then everyone else disappeared, but

One boy, one girl, two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
For a moment the whole world revolved 
Around one boy,  and one girl

In no time at all they were standing there
In the front of a little church
Among their friends and family
Repeating those sacred words
Preacher said, ""Son, kiss your bride"", and he raised her veil
Like the night they met time just stood still for

And said ""I never knew you were a pickup man!""

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

The Nashville Brass,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2011

How she found something in me
That I never knew was there
But she uncovered it so easily

She turned me like a season
And I began to change
She wrapped herself around me

That's how love moves
Like a river
Running through you

Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven
It consumes you
But, that's a given
That's how love moves

I've seen walls that could never be broken
Come tumbling down
I've heard the voice of love
Calling without making a sound

See I was touched by an angel
The day she took my hand
You know she's the miracle
That makes me everything that I am

Sometimes it's just a whisper
Sometimes it's a storm
Sometimes it reaches forever
With it's everlasting arms

The Nashville String Band,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past

Heaven knows how long it's been
Since I've felt so out of place
I'm wonderin' if I'll fit in

Just my luck, they're right on time
So here I go again

But there's just conversation for three
And I like the way she let me get the door
And I wonder what she thinks of me

And I wish that I felt the same
She's asked me to dance, now her hand's in mine
Oh, my God, I've forgotten her name

But I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see
This learning to live again is killing me

Now here we are beneath her porch light
And I say what a great time it's been
A kiss on the cheek, a whisper goodnight
And I say, ""can I see you again""

He barely beat the rain in from the field
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say
""Damn this rain and damn this wasted day""
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh so long
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while
When their eyes met, they both began to smile

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
She wants to know she's needed
She needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket
On the front porch swing
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things
And there are times she feels alone even by his side
It was the first time she ever saw him cry

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you

Beckoning violence

What are you thinking?
And so I slapped the face of love
Clenched fists always seemed to say the right things

First let me up then take me home
So much for talk and compromising
And when you humor me that everything's roses
I know where the truth is

And while you're flaunting your planetary halo
I'm watching your nose grow
I believed that I could never use you up
Do you agree?

Of all the things that I find so unusual
What are you thinking? 
Where are you going with that head?
Full of anguish and suspense?

The Nashville String Machine,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, Who called me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

The sight of you among the sites
I get this sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
Never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
Do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons

Passing buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
Hide among the under views
Huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to god goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
Wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down

Can I stay here? I can sleep
On the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms
On the door
Do not think I'm going places anymore
Wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, everyday I start so great
Then the sunlight dims
Less I've learned
The more I see the pythons and the limbs
Do not know what's wrong with me
Sours in the cup
When I walk into a room
I do not light it up

A hurricane in disguise
And it sings you a song you find appealing inside

Made me quite a little scared
Luckily I found that in the new world

So I told them, they were Indians

No one's changing enough to help you
There's something basically wrong
Everywhere, we revolve out of our time
And we know that's there's
nobody listening to people like us
But for now, for awhile
We just forget all about it awhile
Forget all about it awhile
For awhile
Thoughts of life, lots of women, thoughts of love
These are things that we can't be sure of
And every minute you live takes you
a minute towards when you must die
And we know there are
times when I'm not even sure I'm alive
But for now, for awhile
We just forget all about it awhile
Forget all about it awhile
For awhile
No one's fit to run the world, as far as I can see
The only person fit to run my world is me
But that's just one of my own personal crusades
And for now I'm not complaining, not campaigning

After years of this madness
It's starting to make sense but life, is so hard
Yea, life is hard
And that you have learned
Holding on to your beliefs is noble
But we are faced with reality
Sometimes, to reach that mountain top
We must learn to bleed
So now we revisit the factors
Draw upon all that we dream of
Put aside that old ill mind
And now we breathe

Do I ask myself to choose?
When I don't know what to do",That Side of Me,2002
The New Amsterdams,"It's a clandestine arrangement
Never could get to stick
Night under the table, the sick, the fits

Never cast as the romantic lead
Somehow on our feet
Waiting to be received
The whole scene sighs relief

Somehow, everyone functions
A barely visible scar
Know the length we'd go, so far, so far
Nights, I see the sun come up
I don't remember where it went down

A realist whose time has come
Feels like I'm the only one
And obstacles to overcome
But now I don't trust anyone

So, here's to all our vice, secret double life
Sleep with one eye open and maybe save my life
Here's to all our vice, secret double life
I sleep with one eye open, maybe save my
Maybe save my

It's another cool ass show
Under the table on the ground
The floorshow up to sound
The light show up to specs

We'll drown til we're exhausted
It's what nobody expects
It's what nobody

There's nothing left to lose
And everything to prove
Nothing we can't do
Not anything for you

The words were written wrong
My life imitates your songs
On and on and on

Here's to all our vice, secret double life
Sleep with one eye open, maybe save my life
Here's to all our vice, secret double life
Sleep with one eye open, maybe save my life

Here's to all our vice, secret double life
Sleep with one eye open, maybe save my life
Here's to all our vice, secret double life
Sleep with one eye open, maybe save my
Maybe save my life

It gets older, it?s over me
I?d speak but it fails me
So the dike in the dam stops the leak

Maybe it?s me and I'm venting
I find your speech motivating
Watching life pass you by on the screen
Just flicker and fading with a plot like you wouldn't believe

Maybe I don't know the ending
Someone ruined my daydream
Aren't you spoiled enough as it is?
Whatever you're saying won't bring anyone closer to this

I know you're sick
I wish you were healing

Then we wouldn't be standing here

You called 'bullshit'
And it's not worth money
If your heart just isn't in it

It's hardly a new disclosure

Bottle it up, it takes a bottle to get it out
So many pieces of broken glass, razor wit

You've got a sharp tongue
But I'm not a bad guy
And I wouldn't try to fuck you over

You can't tell me in the South Seas
That I'm missing out
You don't know me

Patience is underwhelming
Besides you don't want to sleep up late

Breathe broken manifold
Time is part of my history

This will be my legacy one day
If I don't have a life to show, put this on my tombstone
Dialer's almost dead, I've gotta let you go
Hang my head next to the phone
Seems so long ago

Looking back on a long night
Sounds bad in the harsh light
At least it's with a document

Don't want remorse to be drowned in the shore

Sold the silver for us all

Nobody knows that I'm on to you
Speak to me secretly, whisper the words in my ear

Find what you're looking for
Lose everything but you do it again

You're always a pilgrim
Leading a small crusade
To find the essential
Not a missionary or a guide
The past is part of this to cast aside

To free who you were before
Find what you're looking for
Lose everything but you do it again
Again

Secret concealed in the wheat fields
There's a mystery to this history
