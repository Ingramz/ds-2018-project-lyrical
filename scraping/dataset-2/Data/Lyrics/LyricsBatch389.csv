Ivy Queen,"Dime, Papi, si te atreves
(Tra, tra, tra)
Bailar ese reggaeton
Ven y búscame a las nueve
Y te ganas mi corazón
(Bailoteo, bailoteo)
Si te atreves
Llevarme a la disco a bailar
(Perreo, Perreo)
Ven y búscame a las nueve

Di-di-di-di-di
Dime, Papi, si te atreves 
Llevarme a la disco a bailar ese reggaeton
Ven y búscame a las nueve
Y así yo sabre si te ganas mi corazón
Dime, Papi, si te atreves 
Llevarme a la disco a bailar ese reggaeton
Ven y búscame a las 9 
Y así yo sabre si te ganas mi corazón

Mami, no sabes lo que tu haces 
Yo te vi bailando 
Y rápido supe que eres clase aparte
Vamos a ver si de aquí nace
Un poco de bailoteo
Pa' que tu veas que el Gran te complace
Muévete, ya me voy a preparar 
Pa' darte un poquito de mi que te va a encantar
(Y búscame, pa', que no te arrepentirás)
(Esta cita será una que nunca vas a olvidar)

Dime, Mami, si te atreves 
Irte pa' la disco y montarte en mi maquino
Yo te buscaré a las nueve
Y así te aseguro que me gano tu corazón
Dime, Mami, si te atreves 
Irte pa' la disco y montarte en mi maquino
Yo te buscare a las 9 
Y así te aseguro que me gano tu corazón
 
Me tocas, tu mirada me provoca
Siento los deseos de besarte la boca
Este reggaeton me pone a mi un poquito loca
La música lenta, y el bajo que te azota
Porque mi mini te pone a ti bien chilling
Ya se que te arrebata mucho más que un fili
Y si en bikini me ves te vas de winning
Porque mi cuerpo tu mente esta killing
 
Oye, mama linda, tu ven aca' 
(Dime, Gran Omar)
Tu cuerpo quiero tocar
(Yo quiero bailotear)
Si tu te ves sexy
(Soy toda para ti)
Te aseguro que los dos",Dime [Video],2010
Ivy Queen,"He recibido una llamada
Me dijeron que te vieron
No quiero peros, tampoco celos
Guarda tu escena, no me des excusas pa'
No voy a escuchar así que cálmala

Ya lo sé todo me dijeron de ella
Me dijeron su vida y en verdad me dan pena
Si tú te crees que con mis brazos
Cruzados yo me quedare

Me miro al espejo
Me peino y me maquillo
Un vestido corto, sabes lo que te digo
Me montaré en mi carro
Por que se su dirección
Que aguante presión de este mujeron

Hola atrevida, yo te traigo una noticia
Por eso es mi sonrisa, y te la dare sin prisa
El hombre con quien sales
Es mío y tú lo sabes
Pero aqui esta el detalle, en la cama no vale

Por eso vine a felicitarte
De lo que me libraste
Y tengo que confesarte
Mientras toman su tiempo
Yo a alguien estoy viendo
Un hombre de verdad y no la basura que yo tengo

La vida es así
Si la sobras de otra te hace a ti feliz
Aquí está el detalle
Yo te lo regalo por todo el sufrimiento
Y el daño que ha causado

La vida es así
Ahora grito a viva voz que con alguien soy feliz
Alguien que me consiente
Me trata diferente, me lleva de su mano
Y me dice lo que siente

Guarda tus escusas que yo tengo otra
Te callaré la boca y coge lo que te toca
Lo que aquí se hace se tiene que pagar
No me distes mi lugar, no tienes que regresar

Yo tengo alguien que me ame al fin
Yo tengo quien me toque a mí
Alguien que me merece y que su amor me crece
Me hace sentir grande, alguien que por mi rece

Yo tengo alguien que me ame al fin
Yo tengo quien me toque a mí
Aquí está el detalle, si no cuidas lo tuyo
Otro llegará y la hará sentir suyo

He recibido una llamada
Me dijeron que te vieron
No quiero peros, tampoco celos
Guarda tu escena no me des excusas pa'
No voy a escuchar así que cálmala

Así que cálmala
Así que cálmala
Así que cálmala
Así que cálmala

La vida es así
Si la sobras de otra te hace a ti feliz
Aquí esta el detalle
Yo te lo regalo por todo el sufrimiento

Ivy Queen,"Todos apuestan que no seré feliz 
Y que el amor pa mi es un ciego 
Yo que tanto le he pedido a mi dios 
Porque he sufrido y tengo miedo 

Cupido frente a mi no se a rendido 
Porque el sabe que yo quiero amor 
Que me reparo las alas 
El me a dado una esperanza 
Una nueva ilusión 

Y esta mujer sin alma 
Le devolverá la calma y curara el dolor 
Que todas queremos un super heroe 
Sus poderes sean la sanación 

Cupido no olvido que yo existo 
Y que en las noches no cariño yo preciso 
Cupido no olvido 
Y del abismo me sacara yo no nací para el maritirio 

Cupido no olvido 
El no se olvido 

Cupido frente a mi no se a rendido 
Porque el sabe que yo quiero amor 
Que me reparo las alas 
El me ha dado una esperanza 
Una nueva ilusión 

Y hasta mujer sin alma 
Le devolverá la calma y curara el dolor 
Que todas queremos un super heroe 
Y sus poderes sean la sanación 

Mientras exista dios en esta tierra 
Cantare a los cuatro vientos 
En reverencia por lo que perdieron 
Lo que gano y lo que quiero 

Cupido no olvido 
El no se olvido

Cupido frente a mi no se a rendido 
Porque el sabe que yo quiero amor

Que todas queremos un super heroe

Tengan la fuerza tengan valor

Llegara a su salvación

Ivy Queen,"Yo nunca pido que me bajen las estrellas del cielo 
Solo yo pido que me alumbren en la oscuridad 
Yo nunca pido que me llenen de regalos lujosos 
Si con una sonrisa a mi me bastara

Toda una vida me lleves de la mano 
Cuando este perdida 
Me convierta en el camino que te de la salida 
Y que a mí me demuestren 
Que en el amor hay vida y sanen mis heridas

Yo contigo vuelo tú me das las alas pa' llegar al cielo 
Dios es mi testigo que todo lo que quiero 
Es ponerle calma a todo mi sosiego 
Mi corazón ciego

¿A dónde irá el amor de un hombre y una mujer? 
Yo solo pido que me enseñen creer 
¿A dónde irá el amor de un hombre y una mujer? 
Yo solo pido que me enseñen creer

A donde vayas sé que si me muestras 
Ganaremos batallas cuando uno se ama 
Lo grita y no lo calla que lo que sucede 
Sus dos almas se hallan quédate y no te vayas

Muéstrame el amor real 
Y así cambiara mi percepción 
Se me ira aquel mal sabor
Muéstrame el amor real 
Y así cambiaras darás color a esta oscuridad 
Mi amor

¿A dónde irá el amor de un hombre y una mujer? 
Yo solo pido que me enseñen creer 
¿A dónde irá el amor de un hombre y una mujer? 
Yo solo pido que me enseñen creer

A creer a vivir a sentir que estén por mí 
Que me digan que me quieren 
Que por mi se muere ¿a dónde va el amor?

Ese amor que todas sueñan de un corazón yo ser la dueña 
Que me apoyen y que me entiendan que las mujeres somos reinas 
El que cure mis heridas me proteja en las caídas 
Adonde vamos las mujeres si no hay amor todo se muere

Muéstrame el amor real 
Y así cambiara mi percepción 
Se me ira aquel mal sabor
Muéstrame el amor real 
Y así cambiaras darás color a esta oscuridad

¿A dónde irá el amor de un hombre y una mujer? 
Yo solo pido que me enseñen creer 
¿A dónde irá el amor de un hombre y una mujer?

De empezar algo nuevo es perdiendo el miedo

Trepare por un balcon, aunque sea en minifalda
Y antes de que salga el sol, yo te juro vida mia
Que la historia cambiaria cuando escuches mi corazon

Para que asi entiendas que esto es amor

Ivy Queen,"He aqui mi presencia
Pues he prometido que venia a verte aunque estubiera fligido
Cogiste el camino de la separacion
why tu no sabes como eso afecta mi corazon
Dios mio ayudame, why nunca permita
Que mi alma se destroce con esta visita
Mi mujer no me escucha, estando ahi acostada
No me mira no me abraza no me dice nada
Culpa tengo yo por no cumplir con mis promesas
Haciendote pasar muchos dias de tristeza
Por que no me di cuenta que yo actuaba muy mal
Ahora el remordimiento me quiere matar
Hombre al fin donde quiera que me paro
Las lenguas me persiguen cuando formo mi relajo
why asi sucesivamente pude perder
La gente habla sin parar sin tan siquiera saber
Pero ya es tarde
Ya escogiste tu decision, me abandonaste why asi cumpliste con tu mision
Pero yo lucho para que unque sea pueda sentir
why se muy bien que es imposible pero voy a seguir
Mi sentimientos hoy, se inclinan a tu vida
Manana buscare un camino a la salida, pues
Esto me encierra en un circulo vicioso 
Que me aparta de lo que pudo ser tan hermoso

Coro (2X):
Me acuerdo cuando te entregaste a mi
Me acuerdo como me aferraba yo a ti
Me acuerdo los dos sonando en una noche de pasion
No me escuchas, no me miras, se remuelde mi corazon

Te noto bien palida 
No eres la misma
Te falta la sonrisa que dibuja tu carisma
Te siento muy fria tus labios resecos
Hinutil te ves, why sin faltarte al respecto pero
Eso no importa te amo como eres
why nunca sentire lo mismo con otras mujeres
Dios me creo para quererte a ti
Yo maldigo el momento en que te perdi
why esta perdida es indudablemente eterna
Quisiera inventarme una luz moderna
Que alumbrara el camino de la felicidad
Porque sinseramente no acepto la realidad
Un ser humano no es capaz de aguantar este peso
Yo sufro me remueldo why lloro en exeso
Si crees que exagero pues lo hago por ti
Porque demuestro lo que tu significas para mi

Coro (2X)

Me acuerdo de la brisa que nos acarisiaba
Pues el viento a nuestra relacion apreciaba
Tu pecho junto al mio el calor provocaba
why asi por el estilo nuesras almas se entregaban
Me acuerdo de la noche en que tu me conocistes
Todas las caricias agradables que me hicistes
Me acuerdo de todas las palabras que digistes
Diciendome en secreto que el amor si existe
Pero con el tiempo el libreto cambio
Pues la malicia como siempre pasa se involucro
why yo un ser humano como los demas seres
Adopte el punto debil del hombre, mujeres
Ya en ese tiempo no pensaba muy bien 
De la pasion por exeso parecia un reen
Te ahogabas en tus lagrimas why en tus sufrimientos
Yo no se lo que pasaba con mi sentimientos
Luego escuche a todo el mundo decir
Que por mi la vida te ibas a destuir
Yo no crei en tus palabras te ignore como a un perro
why mirate ahora manana es tu entierro
Metida en esa caja sin poderte mover
Todos te lloran why me culpan sin poder comprender
Que fue un error no tina los ojos bien abiertos
Mi amor perdoname aunque hayas muerto

Tú sabes que los recuerdos están ahí 
Por más que los cortemos no van morir 
Mi piel sedienta te llama 
Vamos a darle un momento 
A lo que vivimos la primera vez 

Una historia imborrable un amor inalcanzable 
Un amor que muchos quieren y no pueden tener 
Por todo lo que vivimos por lo que una vez sentimos 
Porque sé que tú lo quieres no te miento yo si quiero también 

Volver a verte me ha tocado 
Lo más profundo ha despertado 
Yo sé que el tiempo se ha pasado 
Pero el sentimiento no ha expirado 
Recuerdo tus labios con los míos 
Y también los fríos cuando me abrazabas 
En las noches que hacia frio 
Cuando yo enojada me sacabas la sonrisa 
Cuando me excitabas con solo una acaricia 

Una historia imborrable un amor inalcanzable 
Un amor que muchos quieren y no pueden tener 
Por todo lo que vivimos por lo que una vez sentimos 
Porque sé que tú lo quieres no te miento yo si quiero también

En aquella noche que te pude tener 
Aquella historia tenemos que continuar 
Para podernos dejar en el ayer

When the wheels just seem to turn
And uncertainties about your tomorrow seem to grow

One thing you should remember
And you should always know
Out of everyone who loves you
I love you the most

I am just a prayer away
Call My name with your heart
And I'll hear every word you say

When you cry at night
I'll wipe the tears away
Just pray, my love
And I'll be there right away

You will never have to wonder about My love
Just put your faith and trust in My care
I will always be there to hold you in my arms

When you're afraid don't worry
I'll protect you from the storm
Out of everyone who loves you
I love you the most

I am just a prayer away
Call My name with your heart
And I'll hear

I am just a prayer away
Call My name with your heart
And I'll hear

Iyaz,"Shawty's love is like a pyramid
We stand together until the very end
There'll never be another love for sure
Iyaz and Charice let we go

Stones, heavy like the love you've shown
Solid as the ground we've known
And I just wanna carry on
We took it from the bottom up
And even in a desert storm
Steady as a rock we hold
Wishing every moment froze
Now I just wanna let you know
Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top, like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

Cold, never ever when you're close
We will never let it fold
A story that was never told
Something like a mystery
And every step you took we've grown
Look how fast our time has flown
A journey to a place unknown
We're going down in history
Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top, like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

Like a pyramid girl I'ma show you
That I love you so much that we're gonna get through
Even when it storms I will never go
I'ma be the one to keep you safe
Before was a love I care more than enough
Holding on to one another be the cover when it's rough
Mother nature, or disaster won't stop our happy ever after

Pyramid, keep it going
Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top, like a pyramid
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall just keep on going
Forever we will stay, like a pyramid

With the tears fillin' up in your eyes,
You put your hands around my waist

I'm speaking from the heart, no shame
Since you up and left it has never been the same
Why would I lie, you never realize
That when I'm in your presence you would give me butterflies

Remember talking till four in the morning
I would ask you if you're tired you said no with yawning
The next day, same thing
Oh why did you have to go away

And I just thought that you should know
You are always on my mind
And I can never let you go, not even if I try
I can fill the deepest valleys with all the tears I cry
And I never wanna have to say (goodbye, goodbye)

If you could see how my heart cries
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
I can't let go even if I try
I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye)

Baby girl if you're listening to this
I made a little list with all the little things I miss
Your long hair, beauty eyes, super model lips
When you give my hand a squeeze every time that we kiss
When we watching television
Just a couple of the things I sit on reminiscing
And I will start to cry every time that you will cross my mind

And I just thought that you should know
You are always on my mind
And I can never let you go, not even if I try

'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
I can't let go even if I try
I don't wanna say (goodbye, goodbye)

And I just want another chance
Forget about everything and just give me back romance
I love the way you move, I love the way you walk
The way your eyes close when you smile and you talk

And just the thought of me without you drives me insane
And it'll never be the same if I ever said (goodbye, goodbye)

Where trouble melts like lemon drops,

Why, oh why can't I?

I see trees of green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue, and I see clouds of white
The brightness of day, I like the dark
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' 'How do you do?'
They're really say I, I love you

I hear babies cryin', and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where trouble melts like lemon drops,
High above the chimney top,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
And the dream that you dare to
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,2006

Y horas perdidas luchando contra la ansiedad

Puro nervio, taquicardia y mala onda
El sudor empaña mi visor de cristal

Venti pile vuote le riverso sopra il blocco note
Fiume in piena, catene di edera sopra la schiena

So she strived on to make it come true

The things so unreal would be real

To find herself surrounded by the same old room

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true

What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot

What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal?

And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?

Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out then fade away is what Kurt said

Thought I left you far behind
Back when we both said goodbye

I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I would walk across the world
A million miles from what we were
If that would free me from your chains
Help me forget your name

Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me

I can't make you go away
And I can't take this haunting me for one more day

I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause, I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that
love us back right.

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews, then we step to school
Step from School, back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack, I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because
A nigga sold a couple of mil
Look here
You can't say nothing if you're last in the line
So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind

She laughs to make a smile

She's an anybody,
A plaything for the anythings,
She says ""How can it be wrong,
To have such a nice time?""
Her fishnet crossed legs,
Cross-eyed in the dregs,
She says ""My favorite accidents,
Are purely by design.""

She talks like Julie Christie,
Implied sex and foreign intrigue,
It's the accent that really gets me,
She laughs to make a smile

J Church,"Christmas lights are colorful,
A mini-disco, a pistolero,
Lost in lonely heartache,
It's literal this time,
I'm counting up to half a million,
I used to know all of the presidents,
By name and order of appearance,
In attics in my mind

Traipsing down memory lane,
The streets are all but vacant,
Like some psychic neutron bomb,
Cleaned out this whole town,
Pretty pills once meaning pleasure,
Are now part of the regimen,
I am lost in thought,
There's no need to hang around

Even in a far-off desert,
I can wait a thousand years,
and if I don't know what I'm waiting for,
I can still pretend,
I'm waiting for your guilt assistance,
Waiting, waiting, waiting,
I've got nothing better to do,
Some say it's sad but true

Christmas lights are colorful,
Mini-disco, a pistolero,
Lost in lonely heartache,
It's literal this time,
I'm counting on your secret mission,
Save me from my memory,
Some say I love the drama,
No, I just don't mind

J Church,"He says ""I've wasted my life,
All seventeen years of a life,
On just one girl"",
He says ""It's over. It's over.""

He's lying in the clover,
And there's nothing left for him in this world
Do you ever dream?
Do you ever believe?

But all the stupid people are frightened of the rain,
Your mother hanging laundry up always looks the same
She says ""I've wasted my time,
On boys with one thing on their mind,

That is not love"",
She says ""It's over. It's over.""
She tugs on her pullover,
But no answer comes from the sky above

Are you ever at home?
Are you afraid to be alone?
But all your so-called friends have now got better things to do,
You're feeling sort of scared about the things you thought you knew

And I can't wait to go home,
To find that nobody bothered to phone,
Nobody bothered to phone,
Nobody bothered to phone",She Says,2000
J Church,"Sunshine,
Boring sunshine,
Tripping amphetamine,
Sick inspiration,

Sunshine,
Who needs sunshine?
Leaves me paralyzed,
Sweet perspiration

And I don't want you around,
I'm a nightmare when I'm down,
And I'm going to the darker side of town
Starlight,

It's only midnight,
Smoke your Camel Light,
Your ride is coming,
Bus ride,

To the seaside,
Geary late at night,
The drugs are humming
And the Cliff House is alone,

And it feels like coming home,
And nothing I can do can make it wrong
Childlike,
On the outside,

Tried and crucified,
Don't want to live forever,
Floodlight,
Thick, dripping, dark night,

Let's die together

And I can't keep my food down,

You feel so small,

Why you're acting as though,
She planned the whole life that you lead,
She wants so bad to be,
A mother perfectly,
But she's nothing like what you want to be

She makes you feel so small,
Like you never moved out at all,
You feel so small,
But she doesn't mean it after all

But she misses Hong Kong,
You know, but never to what extent,
She makes Sunday's meal,
Into such a big deal,

(If I want to free?) my mind 
I feel pain and stress 
accompanied by fear of falling  and war 
Gotta hold my breath 
and stay afloat 
What I wrote 
to complement what I feel 
But now my feelings turn to dust 
as I dictate what's real 
Now, all this shit people care about, 
that's made by man 
When all that shit's all gone 
There's nothing left in your hands 
I tried to crush pieces of coal into diamonds 
My timing 
was off, couldn't cope 
with what this life had brought 
But now I realize 
I have to let that bullshit cease 
If something good happens to me, 
it makes the bad increase 
Even unconsciously 
these frauds be hunting me 
in my dreams 
Teaching a lesson, 
that life ain't always what it seems 
Gotta keep these blessings 
At last, 
time is running out fast 
what the future holds 
always coincides with the past

 Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain 
 And had to numb it with baste 
 Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase

 Nowadays I throw shots back,leavin nothin to waste 
 Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place 
 Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past 
 I vowed to never stop winin, 'til the earth stop spinnin 
 Rock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women 
 If it's not him then you got it confused, why'all not remembering, 
 My motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules, 
 I buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it ? 
 I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood, 
 If you ain't live like I live then run with the hood 
 I done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still 
 Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya ? 
 Nigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit 
 Try to pass me in a six, tight classy on the wrist 
 Every bit of 30 karats, this is not a game 
 This isn't why I came, make these words find a spot on your brain 
 And burn, then I recycle my life 
 I shall return

 And shoes off, bout to snooze off 
 Hatin, cause you can't turn the booze off 
 You dudes is too soft, when I fuck with you all 
 I might bark your ex, and spit at the locks

Nobody but us that rap in a clutch
Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch

Never talked our slang, never walked our road

Don't know about those rovers that candy painted
We've been miss quoted, miss construed, miss understood, and over used
So we take this time to set the record straight
Critics skipped and did it anyway
Now you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team
Till you heard 'Tin was gone was apart of the scheme
See! We still got love where was you at at?
Just cuz a nigga go solo think we turn our backs
Maybe we will reunite on some shit like that

But though all the love that I got for you
Partna I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked in the interviews
I been accused of not carin'
When the city threw your furniture out
Its not fair when I'm learnin about how stress you fell in a article
Forget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you
And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back
But don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap
Chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater
In the door by the side
Throw you in the trunk and found a preacher for you
Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Ya parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin normal and
I heard you on medication
Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low
Don't take this as a dis this is just to let you know that I love you

Hold his stoony up
Hole in his ""Chest"" like Cody ""Nutt""

Should have been Kahlua or ice cream
My pipe dream's long as the fight scenes in The Matrix
Scorpio rising, sex fiend by nature
Try to control that shit so my soul don't get
Dirty for some girly, unworthy of the flowers
I admit that I got strange powers
Brain showers
Like the Eiffel, leaning thru life cycle
Hold the bible and a rifle

Mos Def, Jay, Prince, and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, and Biggie
And when the evening is over love
Gonna find a nice spot for the rover love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush
You's a upper echelon piece
So when you find ? then you don't freak
You want to nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga want to get near
Oh I'm a Queens representative
Get wild by any means my incentive is
When we done, I start it up again
And ride round with you 'cause you my special friend, uh

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

The second cut, her ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we paintin on
Abstract the word we creatin on
The TV's in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tip's past the legal one
Outkast's bangin loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cuttin through the still wind
Outsiders lookin in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the armor all touch empty out the dutch
No tobacco spillin on my rug clutch
Kick off your shoes show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues we all forgettin more
Boy that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy maybe you blink
A little harder than your average ?
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you back tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheelin drinkin' ?
Vacationin, V up my V8

I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop 
Hop in your Humer, the Punisher's ready, meet me at Beatles' 
With Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti 
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor, Joey Crack, buck 'em all 
If they move, Noodles shoot that fuckin' whore 
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know 
That we riddled a middleman who didn't do diddly 
 
It'll be a cold day in hell the day I'm taken out 
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill 
I'm still the Fat One that you love to hate, catch you at your 
Mother's wake 
Smack you then I wack you with my snub trey-eight 
 
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children 
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's building up pavilion in my civilian 
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing 
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss 
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support 

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves 
My brother from another mother sent from the above 
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best, might be 
Even better leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee 
 
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture 
You small change, I'm blowin out your brains gettin' richer 

Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what? 
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck! 
Trunk jewels (jewels), cruisin' in the Land, pumpin' 'Cash Rules' 
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryin' to pass through 
That's true, so who the next to get it? 
GS the best that did it (get it off your chest kid admit it)

And it's 
Here, and you don't stop! 
Twenty shot glock with the cop killer fill 'em to the top 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop! 
 
Fuck the po-lice, I squeeze first, 
Make 'em eat dirt 
Take 'em feet first through the morgue, 
Then launch 'em in the T-bird 
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased 
Supposed to supply us with rights, 
Tonight I hold my rosary 
Tight as I can, 
I'm one man against the world, 
Just me and my girl 
Black Pearl Athena my sena who keeps it real 
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it 
Peep it it's no secret, 
Watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it 

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer 
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena 
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and 
You never see me talk to police, so 
You should know that I really don't care 
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there 
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak 
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets 

Fuck peace, 
I run the streets deep with no compassion, Puerto Ricans 
Known for slashin' catchin niggas while they sleepin, no relaxin 
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes 
Three techs in the Jeep Lexus just in case police estas 
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto stylers 
Fill the clips off, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers 
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down 
Heather be couldn't make me put my Glock Down 

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber 
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine 
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York 
When we talk to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk 
And stalk, I prey like The Predator, whoever want it 
Go and get it set it baby and I'ma bury ya 
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin' 
I pull a clip for my weapon and Punish niggas till it's Armageddon

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away,
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand,

Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby,

And each day it grows more and more,
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby,
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door.

J Foe,"All I can do 
 Is sit alone 
 In my room 
 Thinking about you 
 How could it be 
 That you are not here with me 
 When I gave you the best of me 
 I face each day 
 Without a smile 
 And life is so unfair 
 I feel like I want to die 
 'Cause you didn't give me 
 Give me a last goodbye 
 I've waited weeks for your call 
 I've waited here by the phone 
 But when the silence grew long 
 I knew that something was wrong 
 Right then I knew it babe 
 How could you do it babe 
 How could you tear my poor heart in two 
 How could you do it babe 
 Do it, do it, do it 
 How could you do it babe 
 Tear my poor heart in two 
 Ain't no more blue up in my sky 
 Only cloudy mornings 
 And these tears like rain you left behind 
 All of those memories 
 In the corners of my mind 
 I started looking at us 
 At a picture in a frame 
 As I start to cry 
 'Cause I can't picture us apart 
 Oh my god can you help me 
 With this pain I'm feeling 
 I'm feeling deep down inside 
 Girl tell me it's not true 
 Will I have to spend the rest of my life without you 
 How can I get through 
 This pain of loosing you",How Could You,1991

Black whip, all black swag like a panther
Heard through the vine that Stormz' ain't a bad boy
But I take care of my fam, I'm a gangster
Yeah, that's right, just a young boy in the hood
Fast forward now I'm Big Mike
Still away from the hype
Niggas weren't bad back then, nah it's cons man, I swear on my life
Put faith in my knife
Wrong move had me on edge on the back-road, paid my stripes
So fuck these niggas, all these little gun drillers 
Wanna come and try and do me like Trife

You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here

You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here

I'm fully on with your half on
I've done dirt, no mask on
Eighteen when I told man ""Ask Carlos""
Now they ask how much man's car cost
Drive-by ting
Aim for your head and convert 'em with your hard-top
Your leg's sick, your heart stops
That's the end case, nah dawg
Not me, not there, not G
I've got bread on my beef like Soulja
You've got rice, I've got keys, I told you already
My nigga I don't know you from any
Where, big spare that'll go to your belly
There, pay back when you don't owe me a penny
Yeah, fuck that, fist fight, fair and square
Nah fuck that, flick-knife, rare and tear
Nah fuck that, this guy's wearing his share
Might come back, midnight, air an affair
Deal with the matter like Skibba
How's he gonna feel when I'm shattering his liver?
Black boss, you're afraid, I'm gonna pull a River
Fourteen, holding my shank in the mirror
Like I dare anyone
Playground looking like a ? Anthem, where's everyone?
I ain't scared of you but I'm scared of your gun (I am)
Frankly, that's when I got my ting
It was all calm before Stormzy, now it's lightning

You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap, looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here

You're not bad, I'm bad, ask all us
How they gonna harm us?

Presentando a jersey

Cuando te fuiste,
Sentí que el mundo se fue de mi lado y me puse muy triste, me puse muy triste
Y no te voy a negar que a su vez mucha falta me hiciste, (pero piche, piche mas),
Pero el tiempo ayudo a superar el daño que hiciste
Y ahora vine hasta aquí pa' decirte
“Jersey el de la mente dañada”

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me importa 5 y 3
Yo tengo una gata que tiene una amiga
Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me tiene 5 y 3
Yo tengo una gata que tiene una amiga
Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y a no me importa lo que tú quieras hacer con tu vida,
Me tiene 5-3 porque ya yo hice la mía
Tengo dos gatas que se van conmigo a plena luz del día,
Que se tocan y se besan mientras yo las hago mías
Quiero decirte que ya tú vida no me importa
Que estoy mejor sin ti que ahora me sobran las tortas
Tengo muchas amiguitas que conmigo se comportan en la cama como que yo soy el que las transporta


Solo espero que te vaya muy bien,
Mami que sea feliz
Al fin  ahora  que me importa a mí,
A mí me va bien, me siento muy bien, te juro que me va mejor sin ti

No tengas esa presión de que me joda tocona, de que te pases peleando y me des cabrona en la nota, de que si estoy con aquella, de que si estoy con la otra, mami me siento tranquilo de no escucharte la boca,

Tranquila vive tu vida
Que sigo en la mía vacilando con mía gata y con su amiga
Somos tres y ellas dos me tienen al día, y en tu cara se ve que estas ardida

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me importa 5 y 3
Yo tengo una gata que tiene una amiga
Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y tuqui tuqui y tú fuiste te perdiste te jodiste
Por más que te lo dije, mi corazón tú partiste
Aquí sin gajo detuvo mi soledad, 
y por proyectar tu odio ahora es doble mi maldad

Y mira mami, mira lo que tengo ahora
Tengo dos gatitas y usted anda sola
Y se te calentó y a mí se me dio

Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind (on your mind)
See it never had to be this way
You should of never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame
Knowin how the situation changed

Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

And Murda I.N.C.

I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
(love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool

Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny

Baby, is that you're girlfriend
I got my boyfriend

But maybe we can be friends
La da da da da da

Baby, I got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend

Maybe we can be friends

J Love,"Estoy loca
Enamorada, de ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Oh

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny how

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try (though you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel (baby)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it's strange how fate can play a part

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel

And I'll smack the fuckin' shit out your favorite DJ man
Y'all know what the fuck it is man
(Yeah, yeah, and, and say somethin' ya bitch-ass nigga)

Yo, yo, check it out fifty

You handle the bitch-ass rap niggas
I'ma handle the bitch-ass DJ niggas
(Alright, alright)
We gon' bring justice to the game
(That's how we gon' put it down)
Straight muthafuckas

That's the sound of the man, cockin' that thang, that thang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang, thang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya

Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it

Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot this
Say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin' Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans

I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh, you the black hand of death
Then why your name ain't preacher

If you a pimp like kid, why them hoes don't treat ya
If you wanna ball like Kirk
Now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
Blaaat, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty

Say I'm born to rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
Face stone and the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check CNN for the, 'War Report'

See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help

Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me 'cause they couldn't beat me one-on-one

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass

I got, ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck""

My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings

See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em

Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you
I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left
Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery
Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me
I'd probably be in the penitentary
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me
This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed
He made a move and I heard a blast
That's what you get, bitch

Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the shit that I'm on
Cause 50 this; 50 that; 50 stay with a gat
Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the MAC
But when I come through, shh - the talking stop
My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot
Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock
Or the hoes I got - catchin' stunts in the drop
Now, Nas, you love the kid, 50 on that killa shit
That big mobster bad man; BGF guerrilla shit
I'm marking my music like diesel on the block
So if you with me you gon' eat, and you gon' starve if you not
Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha

Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, ""Do your dirt all by your lonely""
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 could even hold me
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
Smoking like we some Jamaicans, fucking with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point him out and watch I knock him off
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfucka!

I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass out the steps
Begging niggas don't understand, no
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating' the lambo
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eatin' apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on the handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Fuck around and get your dumb ass shot

Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble

For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars

I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked

You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
'Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw

Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike

Not enough
Then the future came to me

And I know my mind, I'm outta time, it's over
And I'll leave him here, is there no way to show her?

Can we be loved, can we be free
Can we be all these things you said to me
Can we be loved, can we explain
Can we be all these things and hold the pain

Can we be loved, can we be free
Can we go on, can we not see

Said my love
That was the only way to be

J Mascis,"There's no peace, little comfort, no one's shoulder

I'm not saying much I tried hard that's all I do
Tried and waited then got tired, that's about it
With my time
With my time

Got to wait this time
Why should I have time to answer?

I can't go back, it's faster
Don't expect it 'cause the ending's a disaster

I know why I went to see it
Still not sure what I believe in

I walked in
I walked in
Is this the time I'll understand
Will it pass right through my hand
Till I see you

Said I'm the one who knows
Said I'm the one who knows
Please don't speak of it no more
Been left out, starting to show

And I've tried to keep it simple

Wishing that we might have saw this star
At least I know there's a place I can find you
I've gone over it so many times
Mass confusion in my heart and my mind
Can't really tell you 'cause I got no mouth to

'Cause I'm running to where you are
I can't tell no one
And I can't run that far
'Cause I'm running and it's a shame
If I could I would
But I can't take the blame

Can I run through the time like we said
Picking bits after years in my head
Got the logic in place but it's twisted

I've had the time to make it all fit
But the question is how do you quit
Something I'm having a hard time resisting

'Cause I'm running
And it's a shame
'Cause I felt it long before I knew your name
And I'm feeling insecure
Gotta find a way to get there I'm not sure

Drop in some hints
Then I look to my friends
Who's gonna take you
When you just pretend
Everything stirred in my brain, in and out

I got more than enough, how 'bout you?
What are you seriously looking to do?
Is there a way for this to turn out alright?

J Mascis,"On the road of experience, I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away.
When I think that I'm moving, suddenly things stand still.
I'm afraid cause I think they always will.
And I'm looking for space and to find out who I am, 
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.

All alone in the universe, sometimes that's how it seems.
I get lost in the sadness and the screams.
Then I look in the center and suddenly everything's clear.
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams
And I'm looking for space and to find out who I am, 
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.

On the road of experience, join in the living day.
If there's an answer it's just that it's just that way,

It took everything you had to make it through the night
Have you ever had a week that brought you to your knees
It made it hard to pray - but you did anyway

Holla - I wonder can you feel me
You must be tried in the fire before gold
Holla - had anybody had to cry
Holla - Do you really want to testify
Is that fire burning down in your soul

Hop, skip, jump do whatever you do
Never let life get the best of you

Well get your praise on

So keep your focus person don't you stop
Your life ain't nobody trying to live it

Ain't nobody coming with the water to try take the fire out
With the lord

J Moss,"One day I was driving in my car and I want to change lanes
I'm looking in my rear view mirror and I see a black range doing the same
Turn my blinkers on
Start to make my turn
But he goes before me and now who's wrong but I let the brother go on
I begin to think god I'm glad this man didn't hit my ride
See I'm thinking its done but I catch something from the side of my eye
And If I don't move my head I know that I'd be dead
Dead over lane changing what could make a man so angry

[Chorus]
Let it go (oh we gotta)
Let it go
Stop all of the this fussing
Stop all of this cussing
Stop being abusive
And like some of this music
That's why we gotta

Let it go (yes we gotta)
Let it go
Stop all of this cheating
Stop all of this creeping
Cause once you start believing
You wont be defeated

One day I was checking this girl but I wana stay saved
I got a wife and a kid at home I love and they all share my last name
But looking at them flies it was like a twinkle im my eye
I kissed her she kissed me and now who's wrong and losing their home
If I do it one time what really would the consequences be
Let a 30minute night kill a long term dream and my family
Now she got that baby saying what have you done lately
Don't let a one-night stand come between you and your promise

[Chorus]

I am with you
Trust me I'm a man and understand
But we gotta love thy neighbor as you would have them loving on you
I know you've been deceived
But god can set you free

I said I heed you
Temptation's gonna come on every hand
But we gotta always make sure that we have the right one loving on you
So don't you be deceived by the enemy

Took 22 months now I'm trying to get a block
Fuck football I'm going down another path

To tell the truth I couldn't fuck with math
Did get a scholarship, but I blew that

As long as I'm alive, no hater gonna never stop my drive!
I did it and make it multiply.
Anything else is suicide.
Enemy of the world ' that's I.
Energy of an eagle.
I see no evil and I hear no lie!
Niggas don't wanna see me fly higher than a rocket ship.
Life is not rocket science.
Every day is documented.
All of my time is occupied.
I'm gonna grind & I'm gonna shine!
Ballin' 'til the end of time.
Hate on me and it's all fine!
You just ain't no friend of mine.

I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things.
With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game!
Imagine problems with crooked coppers.
Why they wanna go there?
Try to pop me, lock me, but couldn't knock me off my square.
I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see Flesh stretched out without one thug,
While I'm steady stressin' out
But we doin' our own thing ' the wrong thing.

Twenty-four seven grindin'!

That don't give 'em a reason to hate me, hate me, hate me!
But I know my mind's strong.
None of you suckas can break me! (Ha!)

Stay away, fade away, playa hater!
There's really no need to be crowdin' me,

I know they want my life.
Any weakness, not here, you know that Wish gonna ride! (ride)
Hit the streets with that, better love!
Watch out if you kiss and tell.
You know not to show 'em love.
It's just that they talk too much.
They never know who to trust.
And just when you get enough, a target ' you will become.
That's just the (?)

It's the devil's perpetuation!
Tryin' to make my innocence.
It's my retaliation, I don't need no ignorance.
I'm standing against this army with Bone Thugs-n-harmony, harmony.
Danger is just a part of me, like it's stuck in my arteries.
These poor playa-haters are the motivators.
But I get my paper, paper.
The same rappers that hated us bought the verses, so we can take from them.

Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show y'all soldier ass niggaz
I'm murder city's Sargeant Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
This pussy wrecker and white water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to leave her swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What's up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
And creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Nigga know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggaz need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta click
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke, cook it crack, saran wrap it
One muthafuckin' verse and it's already a classic(x2)
Killer Mike nigga!

Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you

I'll box you in your muthafuckin mouth

My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin', speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, 'cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, 'cause you hate

Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus

Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talkin' about

Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches

Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'

So in love with you

Now you were after me for so long
But I would walk by you and roll on
Had all I needed thinkin' I'm so strong
Just believin' that nothin' could go wrong
But never seein just really what goes on
You'd start speakin', I was like hold on
I'm just fiendin' like I could do no wrong
All that time I'm out cheatin' just all along
But lookin back I was treatin' you so wrong
I admit its seemin' if I chose wrong
But I've been meanin' to change now for so long
And this is the reason I wrote just this whole song

You are all I ever need
You are my everything
You are my only thing
And the reason why I sing

Just like that, well everything changed
And I started lookin at you in a whole different way
And it's kinda strange, but really I'm amazed
How ya caught my eye and ya called my name
I'm the type of guy who thought he had it made
But I can't lie, ain't nothin been the same
Since the time I changed and ya came my way
Rearranged my whole space in such major ways
And to think I used to just take your name in vain
But I'm so in love wit you, that I jus won't contain
The way I feel, 'cause I jus can't explain
And this is the only way I can sum up what I'm sayin

You are all I ever need
You are my everything
You are my only thing

And everday you find a way to make me smile now
So all I got to say every time now
I don't ever want to stray just any time now
I want to know all your ways just every time now
And just for all my days I want to find out
That your love and your grace well its all mine now
And this is all I can say in every rhyme now is that...

Fuori qualcuno urlava scendi sotto ti offro un tiro
E suona il cellulare
È l’ennesimo attacchino
Da sempre qualche infame dà il mio numero in giro
Fa parte del gioco ci sono I pro e I contro
Al mondo
Niente è gratis dico pronto, pago il conto
Guardo lo specchio senza ribrezzo
Con gli anni che ho ammetto adesso
Potrei dare un prezzo a quello che ho
Pensavo bastasse il rock’n’ roll
Bastasse l’instabilità
E invece anch’io ho scadenze tasse e responsabilità
Così la vita assomiglia a quella di mio papà
Ora capisco ho una famiglia
Se sto disco non va non mangerà
Non sono quello che magari ti aspettavi tu
Che mi hai giudicato dai tre minuti che hai visto in tv
A volte mi sento la cavia dei vostri tabù
Ma non pensiate che sia quello che voglio io

Voglio di più di gossip e mode
Di quello che vedi sesso e banconote
Voglio di più di un tormentone
Di questi anni amari di groupies e droghe
Sai che non striscerò per farmi valere
Vivrò così cercando un senso anche per te

Ieri mi sono alzato alle quattro del mattino
Dopo i concerti dormo male chiudo gli occhi e li rivivo
E suona il cellulare la mia band è ancora in giro
Il concerto è stato uguale a me
Tutto esaurito
Sembra impossibile il mondo gira sul mio dito
Ed è incredibile se penso a quanti mi prendono in giro
O se penso a quanti mi credono un mito
Ma io ho capito senza lei io sarei solo col mio oro un fallito
E anch’io ho scadenze e responsabilità
Ma questa vita è facile confronto a quella di papà
E meno male perché quel coraggio non l’avrei
Dopo due anni andrei al lavoro col cannone e sparerei
Non sono quello che magari ti aspettavi tu
Uguale a 100 altri cantanti che vedi in tv
Non voglio il posto da sciamano della trend tribù
O quello da santone o dell’esempio di virtù io

Voglio di più di gossip e mode
Di quello che vedi sesso e banconote
Voglio di più di un tormentone

Vivrò così cercando un senso anche per te

Voglio di più di un tormentone
Di questi anni amari di groupies e droghe

Vivrò così cercando un senso anche per te

E cerco un senso
Perché quello che mi date è vecchio
Non ci credo

Sto sistema più mi ribello
Più mi mette al centro

Loro prendono 50 di paghetta
Hanno la moto la tipa la compagnia
Io gioco solo sul cantiere del cavalcavia
E come un sasso
Cado giù sulla periferia

(Come un sasso che)
E scrivo un'altra canzone
(L'acqua tira giù)
Mentre mi lascio cadere
(Come un sasso che)
E non ne voglio sapere
(L'acqua tira giù)
Nessuno mi può capire
(Come un sasso che)
Solo un altro uguale a me
(L'acqua tira giù)
Solo un altro uguale a me
(Dove vorresti tu non vado mai)

Ventiquattro anni faccio i dischi per campare
Nessuno ci credeva
Adesso è un caso nazionale ma per me questo successo
È solo fargliela pagare tipo alla più carina della scuola
Che ora mi vuole fare
Io faccio il cretino mi faccio le veline
La nuova scimmietta nelle loro vetrine
Eppure dentro sono a lutto anche se ho tutto
Sono tornato dal mio bullo e gli ho fatto brutto
Ma I miei amici stanno litigando
Per il turno per il bagno per lavarsi via
Un po' di fango la gente mi sta addosso
Non mi sta più accanto e dicono è un montato
Si è venduto sta cambiando
Solo mia mamma sa bene chi è alessandro
E non ci dormo con la para
Di fare come un topo per un po' di formaggio
Prendo le gocce e collasso
Senza sogni come un sasso

(Come un sasso che)
E scrivo un'altra canzone
(L'acqua tira giù)
Mentre mi lascio cadere
(Come un sasso che)
E non ne voglio sapere
(L'acqua tira giù)
Nessuno mi può capire
(Come un sasso che)
Solo un altro uguale a me
(L'acqua tira giù)
Solo un altro uguale a me
(Dove vorresti tu non vado mai)

Ripetevano stai calmo
Un po' più controllato
O arriverai a trent'anni e t'han dimenticato
Ma grida sei il capo in fila al supermercato
La signora il benzinaio e pure l'immigrato
Non ho bruciato tutti I soldi e I neuroni
Grazie al sacrificio dei miei genitori
Che non mi hanno viziato come han fatto tanti
E mo hanno figli in casa fino a 40 anni
Io non finirò mai come kurt cobain
Non mi uccide la musica prima uccido io lei
Ti stupisci se tuo figlio mi prende ad esempio
Io parlo la sua lingua e con te resta in silenzio
Non legge il tuo giornale se ne fotte del partito
Per questo resto un mito anche dove mi hanno bandito
Divento la sua arma il suo sogno di riscatto

J-Ax,"Tanta nostalgia dei bei tempi andati
Nella mia radio sulla mia t v
Qui gli orologi si sono fermati
E scusami se non ne posso più

Quanti ricordi dei bei tempi andati
Quando la musica era dei professionisti
Artisti intonati e incravattati lo stesso dopati come ciclisti
Sempre la stessa storia cambia la cornice
È il tempo in cui lo si fà ma non lo si dice
Il sangue lavava il nero via dalle camice
E si vedevano in chiaro tutte le partite
Poi siamo nati noi gli anti eroi
Che hai tutto quello che vuoi ma beati voi
Obbligati a fare il militare te la sei fatta e l'hai dovuta sposare
Forse nel ricordo la vita è più bella
O se stai dentro troppo ti manca la cella
Noi siamo quelli senza spina dorsale
Avete fatto un lavoro esemplare

Tanta nostalgia dei bei tempi andati
Nella mia radio sulla mia t v
Qui gli orologi si sono fermati
E scusami se non ne posso più
Tanta nostalgia dei bei tempi andati
Le stesse facce coi nomi cambiati
Quei tempi qui non sono mai passati
E a noi non passa più

La nostalgia e precoce nel mio paese
E prende ogni italiano dopo un bicchiere
Anche la gente della mia età
Che si commuove coi duran duran
Ma il mio ricordo non è positivo
Tutti vestivano americanino
Tutti sfottevano il mio cappellino
E venire dai quartieri non faceva figo
Al parco dove andavo da bambino
Chi si faceva non faceva un tiro
C'era bettino e gente col bottino
Ma tutto ciò non si sapeva in giro
La gente andava a ballare riempiva il locale
Comunque a me non mi facevano entrare
Invece con 'sta crisi nei privé
Entra la classe media e le bestie come me

Tanta nostalgia dei bei tempi andati
Nella mia radio sulla mia TV
Qui gli orologi si sono fermati
E scusami se non ne posso più
Tanta nostalgia dei bei tempi andati

Stiamo affogando alla rotonda sul mare
Non mi passa più
E questo disco è il mio regalo d'amore a noi
A noi non passa più
Ma quando tocca a noi
Ma quando tocca a noi
Se chi ha la palla non vuole passare a noi
A noi non passa più
È così facile dividere il gruppo
Con voi l'han fatto ai tempi di woodstock
Poi è bastato darvi uno stipendio
E anche il vostro movimento è andato distrutto
Ci lasciate un pianeta coi minuti contati
Diviso a comparti sigillati voi bianchi o colorati
Noi mescolati non targhettizzati crollano i mercati
Abbiamo già stroncato la discografia
E diamo gli ultimi colpi all'editoria
Guardateci ammazzare questa melodia
Ma l'assegno siae quello me lo dia

Di spacciatori e di imprenditori 
Amo l'inferno dei miei gironi 
Amo l'invero con i suoi geloni 
Vivo a Milano con i suoi grigiori 
Vivo in Italia con i suoi valori 
E vivo al mio posto tra i disertori 
""E vai avanti così che muori"" 
Fin dalla scuola elementare ma

Notti e bevute e lavorare 
Fare bambini ma 
Poi vedo papà
Della mia età
Con debiti e casini 
A volte qualcuno va dai vicini 
Con i fucili 
Società che nuoce alla salute 
A me piace starne ai bordi 
Sputare quando ti sporgi 
È che un tot di gente fraintende 
Ancora il mio modo di pormi 
E dare fastidio a chi non ha senso dell'umorismo 
Mi piacciono i cantanti napoletani 
E sono un fan dei loro video 
Mi piace guardare tutte le sere 
Tutte le serie americane 
Per osservare l'Italia poi 
Bucarsi la lingua 
Sputare su villa e famiglia 
L'eredità culturale su
I miti da provinciale

Tutto quello che amo fare è immorale o illegale 
E suonare musica da macellai 
Per quel pubblico che fotte il copyright 
""Ma perché?"" 
Tutto quello che amo fare è immorale o illegale 

È mangiare schifezze 
La puzza di sigarette 
Le feste con la figlia del dottore 
Così mi scrive le ricette 
Amo il Malox Plus 
Perché sono per il fast food 
Per le cuffie con il Bluetooth 
La super-gangia e le pokerooms 
Con raggi gamma divento Hulk 
Questa fobia non la sento più
Corro contro l'armageddon facendo su
Un vodka e redbull

Padre perdona il mio peccato originale ma 

""Tutto quello che mi piace fare"" 
""Ma perché?"" 
""Tutto quello che mi piace fare"" 
""Ma perché?"" 

Fatti di meta 
Fatti di keta 
Fragili come fatti di creta 
Chi se ne frega 
Tanto ne muoiono cinque come me ogni sabato sera 
Schiantato sul male 
Dal quale stavo scappando 
Liquidato dal giornale 
Quelli si stavano tutti drogando 
Cazzo ci lamentiamo noi abbiamo tutto qui 
Possiamo scegliere tra tè vodka o gin 
Tre, Vodafone o Tim 
Liberi però senza vie di uscita 
A me piace il rosso sangue quindi mi serve una ferita 

""Tutto quello che mi piace fare"" 
La litigata con il più grosso 
Tornare a casa con l'occhio gonfio è 
""Tutto quello che mi piace fare"" 
Mi fa sentire un po' meno morto 
E se mi fai male, io me ne fotto

Vecchia scuola non mi serve il chalis

Fino a quattordici anni avevo l'ora di dottrina
Poi la mia prof d'italiano era sessantottina, ho
Partecipato a una protesta che non so ricordare
Come la seconda strofa del mio inno nazionale
I miei volevano vacanze in meridione
Io sognavo le disco, scappavo a Riccione
Se qualche riccone si è comprato lo stato
Non mi sono scandalizzato, già lo davo per scontato
Quindi non chiedete se credo alla nazione
Mentre pago il pizzo senza avere protezione

Sarà che il primo amore mi ha fatto cornuto

Il mio miglior amico è stato detenuto
Siccome il mio pianeta se lo son venduto

Colazione col mulino, bianco come l'omino
Così che ora voglio solo roba industriale
La gomma senza zucchero con dentro l'aspartame
Che bello mangiare come un dodicenne
Che quando vai al bagno, poi sciogli le piastrelle
Ho un danno permanente, un fegato che prega
Poteva andarmi peggio, e diventare vegan
Che costa sempre un botto mangiare roba buona
Il prezzo più no-global è solo da McDonald

Ma nessuno da la colpa alle politiche sbagliate
E miss Italia festeggia con la sangria
L'Europa vota a destra ma per strada c'è la anarchia
Non sono gli immigrati, come dicono i giornali
La colpa è di chi guida, e non dei passeggeri

Io sfotto la bandiera vieni qui e costringimi

Il suo amico è un perfetto nessuno
Infatti ha disturbato i calabresi
E gli hanno rotto i piedi
Arrivi bella fresca e che credi
Che qui giochiamo noi qui cresciamo
Non lo scegliamo no no
Milano

C’era sta tipa veniva dal Nord Est e
I primi tempi andava a letto alle sette
Chiamava a casa dal call center
Ora stringe le tette sotto mezze magliette strette
Cambia guerra cambia città
Suo figlio si confonde ha troppi papà
A casa sua si prendeva una televisione
Raccontava di un paese allegro e caciarone
Poi è venuta qui e ha visto la bugia
La perversione che c’è dietro sta scenografia
La sottile linea sporca tra marca e marchetta
Di un paese che di notte la cerca e di giorno l’arresta
Una sbornia di vodka le ricorda la Bosnia
Abbiamo l’Hollywood ma non la California
E questo è un film con produttore pappone
Uguale come in paullese col bidone",Tre Paperelle,2009
J-Ax,"Ma la serata è incominciata male ed è finita anche peggio
Sapete peraltro che l'alcol e droga hanno segnato tutta la sua vita
Una morte, la sua, che ricorda peraltro anche
Come Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, come Jim Morrison
È crollata sul palco, esanime, tra i fischi dei fan inferociti

Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
In radio gira sempre una mia canzone
Chissà dov'era tutto questo amore
Quando soffrivo, quand'ero vivo
Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
Bruciare il santo e fare la processione
A cosa serve tutto questo onore
Se non ero un mito quand'ero vivo?

Prima di chiudere, una notizia che è arrivata proprio poco
Poco prima dell'inizio del telegiornale
È stata trovata morta 
Non riusciva neanche a star dietro ai musicisti, non si reggeva più neanche in piedi

Su dieci che mi amano quattro mi odiano e uno mi sfotte
Il successo non ti rende più forte
Mi sono fatto come un cane ieri notte
Le belle canzoni le scrive chi soffre
Per dormire ho preso una boccetta intera
Adesso vedo un poliziotto e una cameriera
Vedo me stesso morto sul pavimento
Di quest'hotel a tre stelle e mezzo dopo un concerto
Mi giro e sono in conferenza stampa
Radio e TV presenti in massa
Anche chi non mi passava una traccia
Intervistano perfino mia mamma
Ancora sotto shock, che piange come da programma
Ora la casa discografica investe davvero
Fa la pubblicità che prima gli chiedevo
Persino in rete nessuno odia o dice che fingevo
Sono il cantante più amato del cimitero

Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
In radio gira sempre una mia canzone
Chissà dov'era tutto questo amore
Quando soffrivo, quand'ero vivo
Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
Bruciare il santo e fare la processione
A cosa serve tutto questo onore
Se non ero un mito quand'ero vivo

Oggi, la musica tutta s'inchina alla fine di un grande talento
Ci sono molti santi di dio
Il cantautore si suicidò in una camera dell'hotel Savoia, lasciando questo biglietto d'addio

Perché? È la domanda questa
Un proiettile è l'ultima cosa che mi è passata per la testa
Bang, è entrato dalla bocca è uscito da un orecchio
Il processo inverso di quando cantavo un testo
Non mi è mai piaciuto molto guardarmi allo specchio
I fans mi amavano più di quanto amassi me stesso
Depresso, scrivevano, ha bisogno d'aiuto
Se non somiglia a nessuno deve avere un disturbo
Spararsi è come confessarsi, ammettere di essere anormali
E ora perdonatemi tutti i peccati
Che pena, si fingerà mio amico ogni collega
Gente che da vivo sopportavo a malapena
E qualcuno c'ha basato una carriera intera
Se eravate i miei amici dov'eravate quella sera?
È strano il destino, da divo a divino
Incido più sul mondo ora che coi dischi che ho inciso

Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
In radio gira sempre una mia canzone
Chissà dov'era tutto questo amore
Quando soffrivo, quand'ero vivo
Adesso finalmente sanno il mio nome
Bruciare il santo e fare la processione
A cosa serve tutto questo onore
Se non ero un mito quando'ero vivo

Adesso non mi fanno male le voci su di me
Non c'è più niente da guardare, soltanto musiche
E tutto questo amore non lo sentivo
Quando ero vivo
Quando ero vivo
Io tutto questo onore non lo sentivo
Quando ero vivo
Quando ero vivo",...Quando Ero Vivo,2011

E pure andare a letto senza cena

J-Ax,"Nell’aria la gomma bruciata e il profumo di caffé
Che storia è sempre diventata musica per me
Oggi ho messo le illusioni nella borsa
So che cammino su una strada che impedisce la mia corsa
Con una processione che trasporta la madonna
Per un inchino fuori dalla porta
Di un boss della camorra
Una moschea sgomberata
L’odio striscia, davanti a casa
Non serve andare sulla striscia di Gaza
Si ripetono gli abusi subiti dai genitori
Succede ad Israele tra I bambini al parco giochi

Con uomini senza le palle da sempre custodi di questi bordelli
Ma senza le palle non riesci a goderti le cose come Farinelli
La colpa che viene affidiata a chi viene da fuori se il lavoro manca
Dai miei genitori terroni emigrati in Brianza negli anni 60
Il vetro lavato al semaforo dal pakistano a cui manca la gamba
Che sembra sia quando due secoli come una chiesa, come una statua
Sotto il cartello della campagna pubblicitaria
C’è il travestito che apre il cappotto
L’auto che passa cose evidenti che nessuno guarda
Da quando c’è un grattacielo il mio quartiere si è involgarito
Come i signori di mezza età, con le parigine e il botulino,
Al bar, i vecchi bevono vino, il Pusher ricarica il telefonino,
Un altro viaggio in Italia, per ora sono ancora vivo
Nell'aria la gomma bruciata e il profumo di caffè
Un altro viaggio in Italia e tutto fila liscio
Con dossi, buchi, suoni in strada e ogni Ghetto con su lei
Un altro viaggio in Italia, per ora sono ancora vivo
Nell'aria in mezzo alle tossine, forse un po di rabbia c'è
Un altro viaggio in Italia, Un altro viaggio in Italia
Quest'aria è sempre diventata musica per me
Un altro viaggio in Italia, Eh Alé

E in centro l'apple store è la sola cosa nuova,
Nel vicoletto medievale dietro il MC Donalds.
Rifugio ideale quando bigiavo la scuola,
Dove un tossico mi ha messo col coltello alla gola,
Mentre vomitavo per paura, tra, le siringhe nel bidone,
Fuggiva con la catenina della prima comunione,
Per cambiarla in eroina, in fondo alle campagne,
Dove nonna da ragazza lavorava alle risaie.
I figli non sanno la storia, fanno aperitivi a base di cognac,
Si scannano per le tartine come dei maiali nella mangiatoia,
L'odore letame che dalle cascine arriva qui grazie alla pioggia,
Cade sull'attico della modella, che in coca smascella con la paranoia.
Davanti ad un'alba su Roma che toglie il respiro da tanto che è bella,
Ma la bellezza scatena, nell'uomo il bisogno malato di possederla,
Guardarla con odio bevendo una ceres seduto per terra,
Quando passeggia con il cane chihuahua e il filippino raccoglie la merda.
Davanti alla cassa vecchi cd, ma, nessuno li vuole,
Come i numeri di cellulare, scritti sul cesso dell'autogrill,
Con i camionisti a giocare alle slot machine, ignorando la puzza di piscio.

E ora mi ritrovo ste foto con la faccia di Zoolander
Avevo addosso jeans xxl sopra una jeep piena di neve e di modelle
Già, la vita io volevo fermarla, la tipa accanto a me vedeva solo un bancomat
E io vedevo solo dramma depressione e ansia
Fidati che io non ne sento la mancanza
Lascio ai discepoli perché è da secoli
Che se ti guardo ho le farfalle nella pancia.
 
E ora io ho bisogno di te per dormire la notte
Basta che mi stringi forte tutto va a posto ed è come quando tu
Nel casino che c'è trovi sempre le cose

E proprio come ai nostri tempi si spaccano
E poi succede quasi sempre che in un attimo
Distruggono le cose che amano
Tu dammi sogni e prendi certezze prendi tutto e dammi le carezze
Ogni giorno penso
Non è vero che il grande amore dev'essere perfetto

Odio tutti serve canna
Pranzo mamma vecchia stanza
Apro la finestra canna
Col vicino finanziere sul balcone che mi guarda
Voglio che il quartiere veda bene chi comanda
Così non mi nascondo
E gliene fumo una in faccia
Bacio mamma chiamo Uber
Chiedo fumo dice vada
Me ne schiumo almeno un paio
Prima di arrivare a casa
Passo in fronte ad un controllo
Con paletta sollevata
Ma io sto su un auto blu
E mi aprono la strada
Ogni vizio una condanna
Ciò che ami poi t'ammazza
Fumo nero dama bianca
Rete 4 pasta grappa
Ma entro in stanza
Lei già calda
Via la gonna maglia tanga
Suda grida birra canna
Guerra vinta canna
Nanna!

Oh Maria Salvador
Te quiero mi amor
Tetraidro rivoluzione
Tra le note di questa canzone
Non è verde soltanto l'invidia, che divora la società
Ma è verde una foglia che vibra
Piccolo spazio pubblicità

J-Ax,"Siamo noi
Quelli che non hanno credito
Dal carattere epilettico che nascono col debito
Ogni generazione ha un prezzo
Ogni generazione ha perso la sua guerra con il tempo
Col governo e col medico
Ma noi non siamo come voi

Non ci spaventa stare al verde
Non contiamo i soldi non contiamo gli anni
Non contiamo niente
Non conta questa gente
Che morbosamente fa la fila per guardarci come un incidente

Le nostre donne odiano le altre donne
Peggio dei misogini
Di fianco ai loro uomini dai giorni poveri
Allo stadio coi fumogeni
O sotto i lacrimogeni
Col grammo nel rossetto
Nel ghetto col tacco dodici

Le nostre donne sono il vento
Che rende un mozzicone incendio
Senza ci sentiamo frankenstein
Dei mostri ai quali manca un pezzo
Lei è l'ultimo frammento
Mix letale più di Bonnie & Clyde
Siamo Miss&Mr Hide

Siamo noi
Che il tempo ci fa il solletico
Mentre gli altri si sistemano
E si sposano, poi si spengono
Ma noi non siamo come voi

Le nostre donne invecchiano con gusto
Le vostre coi fusò, cameltoe e chirurgo
Ma la bellezza pura dura più di una stagione
Le vostre kim kardashian
Le nostre Sophia Loren

Le nostre donne sono il vento
Che rende un mozzicone incendio
Senza ci sentiamo frankenstein
Dei mostri ai quali manca un pezzo
Lei è l'ultimo frammento
Mix letale più di Bonnie & Clyde
Siamo Miss&Mr Hide

Siamo noi
Coppie che danno spettacolo
Che però non si separano
Al limite si sparano
Cattiveria e sangue freddo
Perché dentro c'è l'inferno
E non crediamo più allo specchio
Ne al diavolo o al pentagono
Ma noi non siamo come voi

Le vostre donne amano il diamante
Le nostre ci amano come uno squalo ama il sangue
Loro rendono le vostre vite più tranquille
Cioè convertono in artista anche il peggiore serial killer
Sono la ragione per cui si canta, scrive e dipinge
Al posto di mettere bombe e di cercare risse
Le coppie normali si vogliono bene
Noi siamo soldati che sono stati in guerra insieme

Le nostre donne sono il vento
Che rende un mozzicone incendio
Senza ci sentiamo frankenstein
Dei mostri ai quali manca un pezzo

Vuoi una botta? No
Vuoi una bocca? No
Dai, no
Dai, no
Dai, no

Oh questo bar mi ricorda l’underground duro e puro,
Gente che mi odia e intanto mi lecca il culo 
Le donne non le chiamo cagne di sicuro ma la tua mi guarda 
E tra le gambe fa la schiuma come cujo,
Questa scena se la abbaglia, 
Se dici ha casa ho una beretta so che è una caldaia, 
Dammi del fallito, che se il successo lo misuro da quanto ti rode il culo, 
Noi siamo I Beatles

Yeah yeah,questo pezzo è una notte da leone 7
Atto di forza Gue Peque e tipa con tre tette
Uh, sono il peggio, come le scritte nei cessi 
Tu sei fake come le mosse nel wrestling, uh 
Io non faccio free style come dice la parola stessa zio
Io di free non faccio niente mai
Ciao Tokyo mai sobrio e non ti ho mai cagato
Guarda come sono messo e dove mi han taggato

Come no, siete hard core come un tredicenne che ha appena scoperto I Doors, 
Siete in posa come Vogue, invece io lo so

Zimbelo, beviti il tavernello di merda
Gia ai tempi di mifisto con coca e cartier 
Sciampo in bocca più di fructis di Garnier

Frate sto senza capelli senza fisico ma le vostre fidanzate 
Le conosco tutte in senso biblico
Zecche senza me zio se voi siete hard core io sono heavy metal, 
Voi non fare rap, fate moneta

Che se non ci davo un taglio mi fottevo la carriera
Con le zoccole a Las Vegas come Tyson
Come un insetto con il Buygon
Perchè non ho mezza misura e se tiro aspiro polvere come un dyson, 
Poi cerco una che fa schifo tipo 
che ti prendi il tifo dal piercing arruginito 
Che c’ha sotto il clito, 
Ho smesso quando I preti hanno iniziato a farsi righe 
Che oggi vomita sul palco anche Justin Bieber

Come no, siete hard coree,

Come no, siete hard core 
come un tredicenne che ha appena scoperto I Doors,
Siete in posa come Vogue
Invece io lo so, cos'è solo il sesso e il rock’n roll

La mia carriera è dalle stalle alle starle 
Giù da quanto sputi palle sembri uno sputa palle
Io fuori moda come il mallet
Però quando rappo fidati sembro il principe di Galles
Cazzo vuoi insegnarmi ch’ero in giro a fare I pacchi fra
Spacchi fra, ma io ho il tridente sulla macchina 
Non fare dance frate bevi le gazzose
Io non sono uno che esagera vado in overdose
Per quanto digiti minkiate c’hai la tendinite
Io sto con la tua tipa in stanza con le tende unite
Dopo di me porto la crew e lei la darà a tutti
Non siete farabutti, state in para muti

Rimo dai fine novanta Fifty Malaguti,
Potete vincere soltanto una gara di rutti
Tu duri fino a domani sei arrivato oggi 
Non cagare il cazzo una legenda come Ozzy

Io a questo punto ho tutto quello che mi serve, 
Fondo etichette, fotto le tue etichette
Ho I numeri del pop, il pubblico del rock, 
L’ego del repper ,l’erba del regge, 
Vecchio teschio come I Rolling Stones noi siamo Dave Croll , 
Voi siete Carly Loff , vuoi comprarti la droga poi copiare 
Il flow però ti manca il sesso ed il rock’n roll.

Qua c’è da ricostruirsi un’immagine, così
Passa la cerveza che canto una canzone de
Rivolucion con el mi hermano sabor latino
La ditta è andata, (beber)
Stipendio nada, (beber)
Donna incassada, mi ha chiuso fuori casa. (beber coño)
Vodka gelata, (beber)

Lei era enorme, però ci stava, (oh)
Bella balena sono il capitano Achab (salute)
Nel nome di Bacco stappo come De Andrè, Monet, Picasso
Mio nonno arando il campo col fiasco, come Guccini sul palco
Intanto bevo perché sono un coglione, ma se non bevo sei un coglione te
Scemo, lo so che il fumo ucciiide ma se non fumo voglio ammazzare te
Ee drop
Cos’è il drop
Eh, drop è quando si svolta la base e I ragazzi stanno
Li tutti fermi, poi scende il basso che picchia e si pestano in pista.
E devi aggiornarti fratellino: più fresh, più swag
Ah, sì
E non fare nomi che poi mi tocca litigare come uno zarro alle giostre.
Il primo coffeeshop in cielo, l’hanno aperto da trent’anni.
Io mi immagino già John Lennon far su l’erba di Bob Marley,
Accendendole con I lampi, tutti fatti reincarnarsi in dei piccioni,
E cagare in testa a Fini e Giovanardi.
Per quelli come loro siamo dei balordi, con I nostri volti sconvolti,
Intanto si intascano I soldi, massa di ipocriti ingordi!
Ho sognato che ero in uno Stato,
Tollerante e più informato, più corretto e meno corrotto, poi che peccato…
Questa mattina, mi son svegliato e ho fatto ancora colazione con il Maalox
Chissenefrega, noi ci si piega e poi cantiamo una canzone all’invasor.
Bevo perché sono un coglione, ma se non bevo sei un coglione te!
Scemo, lo so che il fumo uccide ma se non fumo voglio ammazzare teeee!
La mia ragazza mi ha lasciato, colpa dei tempi moderni
M’ha beccato con giù I calzoni mentre mi facevo un selfie
Lei in lingerie, io col computer e I giochini
Così nerd che posso fare sesso telefonico con Siri
E’ la crisi che rende più pigri gli uomini
In Italia così sì dall’anno domini
Più che giovani dentro conta essere dentro delle giovani
Che se ci si intossica si broccola di tutto
Perché la vera figa è come la lucciola, la vedi raramente e solo al buio

Che se non mi uccide quel fast food che mangio in chimica
Mi ucciderà lo stress, la banca, la politica
C’è già il mercato che ci stermina, prima dell’ebola
Tanto noi qui stiamo a pezzi come Legoland
Questa mattina, mi son svegliato e ho fatto ancora colazione con il Maalox
La gente annega non ci spiega
Cosa la fermi dal bruciare le città Il pub
Bevo perché sono un coglione, ma se non bevo sei un coglione te

Scemo, lo so che il fumo uccide ma se non fumo voglio ammazzare te
(Studenti e pensionati homeless)
Bevo perché sono un coglione, (autisti Uber)
Ma se non bevo sei un coglione te (i designer del salone del mobile!)
Scemo, lo so che il fumo uccide (gli sfollati del Macao, Daltanious!)
Ma se non fumo voglio ammazzare te! (e I politici onesti!)
Ma ancora
Ecco, niente, silenzio
Abbiam capito!

No, guarda che abbiamo capito.

J-Ax,"Allora zio mandami una base vintage
Così vintage che piace agli hipsters
 
Così
Odio essere un cantante impegnato
Ogni mattina mi sveglio e devo pensare
Ma quale t-shirt esprime al meglio il mio punto di vista
Sul dramma palestinese 
Poi da quando ho installato Linux sull'iphone
Mia mamma non riesce più a chiamarmi
A volte mi sveglio piangendo e penso se forse 
Non sarebbe più facile indossare 
Una tuta blu da metalmeccanico o da benzinaio? 
Si, il benzinaio è il brand che I miei follower su instagram
Apprezzano di più
Oddio è già il primo maggio? arrivo
 
E' la storia di un ragazzo ignorante
Nato a metà tra città e campagne
Che non ha fatto I compiti delle vacanze
Ma vuole capire chi ci ha messo in mutande
Intimissimi come la mafia con Violante
Siccome in classe feci la lotta
E non studiai la lotta di classe
Sono catatonico con la Bignardi
Meglio farmi un allucinogeno
Che ste due palle allucinanti
 
C'è servizio pubblico alla tele mi calo un fungo messicano con Fedez
Ci credi vips potenti io vorrei solo un retweet da Giulia Innocenzi
Effetti dei funghetti ci mettono nei guai
Più del marito della Mussolini con le minorenni
Vedo Grillo con le squame come in District 9 o come tossici di crocodile
 
Io nella vita ho fatto tutte le cose più idiote
Ho mixato alcolici e rap con I Gun's N' Roses
Ho vissuto di notte, ho vissuto di note
Ma l'errore peggiore è stato mischiare
Santoro e peyote come il lavoro e l'amore
O quando cade il sapone in prigione
Cose che fan male più delle droghe
Mi stringo I cojones seguo Santoro in peyote
E vedo I mostri nel televisore
 
Vedo un dibattito dove si battono 
operai imprenditori su un elastico
Fuori il popolo è più famelico 
Gli mandi Ruotolo ma se lo mangiano
E divento grande grazie al fungo come Mario Bros
Ma l'esercito e I marò mi sparano come a king kong
In cima ad un grattacielo vogliono che cado
Finalmente so cosa vuol dire essere italiano
 
I nervi si stendono con le tangenziali
Il mio corpo assume dimensioni nazionali
Perdo la memoria pechè I monumenti cadono
Respiro veleno come all'Ilva di Taranto
Il fegato si spappola cirrosi epatica
Faccio una lampada soluzioni di facciata come L'Aquila
Sedere vergine come la Val di Susa
Inculato dalla TAV nella mia parte più pura
 
Io nella vita ho fatto tutte le cose più idiote
Ho creduto ai libri ai cantanti alle mode
Ho amato certe vaccone tatuandomi il nome
Ma l'errore peggiore è stato mischiare
Santoro e peyote come il lavoro e l'amore
O quando cade il sapone in prigione
Cose che fan male più delle droghe
Mi stringo I cojones seguo Santoro in peyote
E vedo I mostri nel televisore
 
Vedo nuovi governi appena fatti già putrefatti dai soliti vermi
Politica allucinante altro che LSD
Vedo il pacco come a modelli D&G
Italia game over la testa mi esplode
Batoste Battisti battute battone
A destra uno spruzzo a sinistra un coyote cado io nel burrone
Santoro in peyote come il lavoro e l'amore

Scende uno con il mitra
Io mi dico oddio è finita
Poi mi spiega che in caserma ci sono tanti miei fan
E’ la moda che oramai è in crisi di creatività
La maglietta dei Romones senza mai ascoltare il punk
La camicia di flanella presa in prestito dal grunge
Alla fine t'è toccato riscoprire anche J-Ax

Mi offrono la droga, mi squilla sempre il cell

Senza addosso grandi marche
Con problemi con il padre

Però che sono dolce dillo alla mia ulcera
Che sono giovane dillo alla mia prostata
Come Coppola con il padrino sbanco con il primo e con il follow up
Dillo alla fashion blogger che mi followa
Che la fama è come quella che ha un bel viso e un brutto culo
Non la voglio più vedere subito dopo venuto
E la mia ex non la sento
Manco la saluto

La mia ex è un genio del male
È Lex Luthor

Dove vanno I tram ma non ci vai tu
Dove San Valentino lo passiamo all'Ikea
E I balordi non hanno il chopper ma il T-Max blu
Ci sono bar che cambiano gestione
Chi dopo un viaggio a Ibiza organizza feste cool
Chiamano dj e la drag queen e fanno zero persone
Riempiono solo con la Champions League in pay tv
Dove prendi mano un libro solo per fare un filtro
Dove tutti fanno rap e nessuno compra un disco
Sulla piazza della chiesa a non fare un Cristo
Ci sono I miei ex amici a pregare che fallisco
Il sabato la pizza con le compagnie rimaste
Stordite dalle paste che hanno preso ai rave
E le ragazze col trucco pesante copiano
Anna Tatangelo e Lana Del Rey sembrano più Moira Orfei

Che bello non sentire più I vostri cani sul balcone
Che bello non sentire abbaiare neanche il padrone
Vantarsi di trombate o di connessioni mafiose
Che spacca dice e fa ma alla fine non si muove
Stesse droghe col pallone
Sedici anni col pancione
Sempre là in cattività come il destino vuole

Avevo nostalgia ma non lo riconosco più
C'è il pieno di architetti e creativi
Gli artigiani sono schizzati via
E gli affitti schizzati su
Prima era più real anche se ne odiavo la monotonia
Odio di più pagare 15€ una sangria al bar
Con sti qua che non parlano di calcio ma
Dei film di Lars von Trier
 
A questa periferia vorrei rubare la Vespa
E rapinare questi hipster di merda
Pensa che bellezza
Ricordare a chi s'atteggia
Questa periferia un paio di cose le insegna
Come distinguere chi c'ha la paghetta
E parla di protesta con sti jeans a sigaretta
Basta trasloco in una zona sopra la media
Di disoccupazione e zanzare media
Di attività illegali sopra la media
Di giovani arrapati sopra la media
Di tipe con il culo sopra la media

Ieri t’ha visto al locale buttare schiaffi a caso al tavolo di un balordo
E che alle sei stavi giù al chiosco sporco di sangue sbocco
Ah all’improvviso vieni a preoccuparti
Tre mesi che chiamo l’assistente per parlarti
Per te davo testate al muro mo’ manco mi guardi
Ho fatto gli anni e voi nemmeno gli auguri bastardi
Era tre giorni fa gli auguri gli ho fatti
Poi per ogni compleanno tu dai almeno quattro party
Svegliarsi tardi è un lusso che non ho più
In doccia alle otto e mezzo e poi riunione per il tour

Tutti che infamavano a bestia ma io dicevo va bene così
Vecchie storie che tiri fuori ma un pretesto
Ho dato tutto li doppio indietro ma non è per questo
Che ora sclero almeno parlo in faccia
Nessuno ti fila dagli anni 2000 sei fermo hai novanta
Per me Milano si inchina
No tutta Milano fai pena
Tutta la gente ne parla

E la tua ambizione più grande
È una ventenne e una cena
La chiami vita mondana ma

Puoi combattere quanto vuoi
Ma i pensieri con le mani vanno dove sai
Questo lo dice Freud
Che l'amore non paga mai
Ma l'amore è chiaro che la paghi prima o poi (ah, sì)

Dopo secoli di quadri, romanzi e canzoni
Ho capito solo che l'amore non ha manuale di istruzioni
E tu sei ancora mia nonostante Freud
Dica che non siamo compatibili come iOS e Android
L'unica che non manderei via la mattina dopo

Eppure ti vorrei prendere in piedi in mezzo alla cucina

Ti hanno detto non si fa, ma sotto sotto vuoi

Siamo come siamo, ma l'amore cos'è?
Il tuo baricentro, un gioco d'istinto
Eva contro Adamo e c'è chi fa da sé
Qualcuno l'ha scritto
Sul muro qui sotto
«Freud è uno di noi»

E non saremo mai una Polaroid
Da tabloid, né supereroi

«Freud è uno di noi!»

E balleremo poi, in equilibrio sui rasoi
Ma decidiamo noi, noi

Questo lo dice Freud
Io direi che non si sa mai

Che dice che l'amore è una psicosi non m'importa (no)
Sto bene con la giacca e la camicia di forza

Questo lo dice Freud
Che qualcosa nasconderai

E non curiamo il sintomo
E non cerchiamo un simbolo
A volte per l'amore, a volte un sigaro
È soltanto un sigaro

Siamo come siamo, ma l'amore cos'è?
Il tuo baricentro, un gioco d'istinto
Eva contro Adamo e c'è chi fa da sé

E balleremo poi, in equilibrio sui rasoi
Ma decidiamo noi, noi

Questo lo dice Freud
Devi mordere prima o poi
Cerchi sempre con la bocca quello che non hai
Io non so cosa sia
Ma la pelle non cambia idea
Che l'amore fatto bene mica è una teoria

Siamo come siamo, ma l'amore cos'è?
Il tuo baricentro o un gioco d'istinto
Eva contro Adamo e c'è chi fa da sé

Dopo secoli di quadri romanzi e canzoni
Ho capito che in questa materia
Al posto di neutroni e protoni
Ci sono visioni, emozioni ed ormoni

È uno scherzo candid camera dei deputati
E come stiamo ce lo leggi in faccia
Cittadini dello stato d’ansia
Le lacrime che bruciano quando escono dai pulpiti
Non hai spina dorsale sono allergico ai molluschi
La testa in multisala io mi faccio i film
Perché è molto meglio che restare qui
La vita che ti viene incontro corre a fari spenti
Devi saper fare affari insieme ad affaristi esperti
Con esperimenti fatti solo sopra a un certo rango
La gente terra terra quando piove si fa fango
La luna ha mille facce ma ne mostra solo una
Vado in shock anafilattico pizzico di sfortuna
Mentono da tempo immemore addestrati per dividere
Ci dettano le regole perché non sanno scrivere

È l’allergia che mi muove verso i sogni e il futuro
Oggi non voglio vedere nessuno

Che mi muove le ossa
Che mi prende la mano con forza
E qualche volta anche per i piedi
Per fare sì che io non anneghi
O che ritorni quello di una volta

Da ragazzo mi chiedevi se stavo bene
Così secco mi si vedevano le vene
Il dottore perché non mangiavo ed ero blu
Mi diede il tavor e io pazzo ci ho bevuto su
Ci stavo dentro solo quando ero fuori perché
Per distruggere il mondo partivo da me
L’alcol come medicina per la noia poi alla fine della storia sulla schiena 
Senti il peso dello scimpanzé
Ma la musica ribelle prude sulla pelle
Sono allergico al contatto con la polvere di stelle
Non so pensare in piccolo allergico al compatto
Meglio precipitare spesso che volare basso
Da ragazzi soffrivamo una fame diventata bulimia
E poi allergia alimentare
Ma per scrivere io devo alimentare l’allergia

È l’allergia che mi muove verso i sogni e il futuro
Oggi non voglio vedere nessuno
Tu mi lasci e mi prendi

Una lacrima che evapora e sale nell’atmosfera
Forse ti raggiungerà

J-Ax,"Una storia è una salita
Una strada, una matita
Un microfono, una stretta con il sangue fra le dita
Che Dio ci maledica sento le sue impronte di una croce incisa
Con l’olio bollente sulla fronte
Un animo bastardo, una cieca convinzione
Un rifugio, uno sguardo, una ricerca di attenzione
In bilico fra l’odio profondo e la redenzione
Ho scelto la beatitudine dell’eterna dannazione

Hey, lo sai che ho perso troppo tempo
Il sasso e tu l’hai ritrovato
Chi dice marchiato, chi dice macchiato
Di indelebile c'è solo un destino segnato
Cercavi conforto in un uomo contorto
Ma il fato beffardo è del fiato e già corto
Per noi non c’è cura non c’è medicina
Se poi mi sento solo quando mi sei vicina

Coscienza lava a secco
Una doccia di sangue freddo
Sono talmente perso che non trovo più me stesso
Nulla accade dal nulla ne son certo
La mia ambizione ha superato di gran lunga il mio talento

Si potesse cancellare tutto il male
Lo berrei come assenzio stanotte
E quante volte avrei voluto urlare ma sono rimasto in silenzio
A pensare alle cose che ho perso
Ad immaginare fosse diverso
Non mi guardo da mesi allo specchio
È da un po’ che sospetto che dentro al riflesso 
Ci sia quella maschera che mi hanno messo

Eh, come un alieno per tornare a casa
Punto alle stelle sono a metà strada
Da bambino ero felice quando nevicava
Adesso blocca il traffico rovina la giornata
In mezzo a una folla di voci che acclama
Avere un radar e sentire solo quella solitaria che infama
Che poi la fama non ha utilità né importanza
Quando vedi chi ami andare via sull’ambulanza
E allora ho chiesto scusa al cielo
Per la mia vita intera
Mentre l’infermiera le infilava i tubi nelle braccia
Ho pregato dio ""prenditi i soldi, la mia moto e la carriera""
Ma non portarti via la mia ragazza
In un attimo solo capire veramente quello che conta
Realizzare per tempo che nessuno vive per sempre
Quante domeniche a casa in hangover
Invece che andare a trovare la nonna
Adesso mi manca della dolce vita
Me ne pento ora me ne pento amaramente
Perché quando corri per vincere non vedi quello che perdi
Tua mamma chiama in ufficio
Tu rispondi in fretta e coi nervi
Tra chi è troppo avanti e chi arriva in ritardo, comunque nessuno è in orario
Io voglio tagliare la corda più che tagliare il traguardo

Nulla si crea, ma qualcosa si distrugge

E non so se nel tuo armadio hai più scarpe che scheletri

Ognuno ha i suoi fantasmi proprio come Scrooge
Siamo due persone ma per molti siamo solo titoli
Ero dentro la tua sfera poi ho sbattuto sui tuoi spigoli
I nostri sentimenti sono geometrie imperfette
Due galassie parallele, col destino delle rette
Mi scopro più vecchio, ma mi sento più nuovo

Dalla fame alla fama, hai raggiunto i tuoi scopi
Ma non cambio idea: l’amore andava prima testato sui giochi

Gli amanti e frasi fatte di rimpianti
Fra i tanti hai scelto uno, ma non uno dei tanti
Inseguiti dalla gente
Viviamo sotto scorta di calmanti
Che non ha senso interrogarsi su quel che pensavo giusto
Abbiamo un problema
Dove sei Houston?
In fondo onestamente sai che cosa ce ne fotte?
Barcolleremo a casa verso la mezzanotte

J-Ax,"Ho aria condizionata e moriamo di caldo
Diamanti veri ma sorriso falso
Ormai reggo meno la gente che l’alcol
Odio le feste
Indosso il VR
Non guardo modelle
Non mangio la carne ma ho sedili in pelle
A casa del magnate russo vado in panico di brutto
Tutti nudi come Woodstock desolattico di lusso
A metà tra un lager e un castello delle fiabe
Tu sei collassata, bella addormentata nel bosco verticale
Principessa da svegliare con un bacio
Ma forse chiuso in questa torre sono diventato il drago
Quindi ignoro lo skyline guardo l’America in tv
Più che non dormire mai la mia città non sogna più

Dove si va dove si andrà
Se non ci danno da bere qua e nemmeno al bar
Vorrei guardarti ancora ballare se lo stereo è spento
Voglio una gif del tuo movimento
Non ho l’età e non ho le tag
Io per amare e scriverti la, la verità
E mentre passa già la prima metro sotto il pavimento
Sopra ci sei te e tutta Milano intorno

Eh sì, ho il cane è di razza ma sono un bastardo
Vite che passano sempre in ritardo
Se bevo non devo se bevo straparlo
Che basa, il cervello s’intasa la testa
Che sfasa, e ho perso più chance che chiavi di casa
Il tempo che scorre dentro le mie vene con donne più condivise di un Meme
Chiedere scusa non sempre conviene ho tanti difetti ma li porto bene
Mentre la mattina aspetta un’altra birra e sigaretta
Non andiamo da nessuna parte ma siamo di fretta
Le nostre vite semplici senza salsa piccante
Io credo nella gente ma non sono praticante
Geloso anche del vento che ti accarezza
Se vieni dal basso hai sempre paura di non essere all’altezza

J-Ax,"Eh
Ed io che ho realizzato un sogno, il mio più grande orgoglio
Non è la Porsche che ho appena parcheggiato fuori
Per quanto finto il sottoscritto sa di avere vinto
Solo quando ha estinto il mutuo dei suoi genitori
Qualunque inquilino condivido la mia stanza
Quello che si dice convivere con l’ansia
Dalla cameretta al camerino
Tutti ti stanno accanto, nessuno ti sta vicino
Il cuore come un iceberg circondato dalle navi
La paura di affondare, scontro fra Titanic
E più parlo d’amore, più non so come amare
Le canzoni non sanno mentire, ma i bugiardi sanno cantare

Quanti anni ci vogliono
Per raggiungere l’euforia
Per le piccole cose che non hai ancora
Perché a volte puoi spingerti
Oltre ogni confine
Arricchire, svuotare un’esistenza intera
E sentirsi felice
Anche solo ad immaginare
Quelle piccole cose che non hai ancora

Sì
Quante macchine veloci compriamo in leasing
Che non ci danno l’emozione della prima bici
Quanti hotel con la piscina e la palestra, doccia iper moderna
Poi non capisci l’acqua calda e l'fredda
Quando scende la fattanza crisi di coscienza
Vuoi distruggere la stanza, Breaking Bad and breakfast
Quanta fatica per salire in cima
Per poi scoprire che c’è poco ossigeno e non si respira
Per riempire buchi, riscattare amori mai compiuti
Ci nutriamo dei “mi piace” degli sconosciuti
Con milioni di canzoni in streaming
Si torna ad ascoltare sempre quelle che si amavano da ragazzini

J-Ax,"Da ragazzini era normale non avere soldi
E prima d’ordinare controllare il portafogli
Guardavamo le vetrine con occhi enormi
Sull’autobus che dal centro ci riportava ai bordi

Tu andavi bene a scuola
Io con la testa in aria ero un asino che vola
Poi sarà il mondo del lavoro che ha mentito alla tua laurea
E ai miei sogni mantenuto la parola ma

Questa sera andiamo in disco
Entriamo con il timbro
La mia ragazza porta due sue amiche single
Con questa boccia ci paghi l’affitto
Scroccare è ancora meglio che esser ricco

Come il crimine, senza regole
Come le ragazze con il grilletto facile
Entriamo senza pagare
Come dei calciatori di serie A
Ci guarda tutto il locale
Ma alla fine nessuno ci toccherà
Come il crimine

Andavamo ancora al nido con mamma e papà appesi ad un fido
E poi la vita che ti sfianca sempre con la faccia stanca
Senza gli abiti di marca con due cuori e un mutuo in banca
E invece adesso l’alcol scorre a fiumi
E solo donne di facili consumi
È un museo dell’ostentazione
Colleziono quadri della situazione
I ricchi all’ingrasso
Le fighe all’ingrosso
Selezione all’ingresso
Ti sembro depresso?
Mai il riscatto sociale
Solo ai ricchi è concesso il lusso di non pagare

Come il crimine, senza regole
Come le ragazze con il grilletto facile
Entriamo senza pagare come dei calciatori di serie A
Ci guarda tutto il locale ma alla fine nessuno ci toccherà
Come il crimine

C’è una macchina scura
Con una luce blu
Sembra quasi la luna
Sia arrivata quaggiù
E bisogna essere un po’ criminali per salvare il mondo
Dalle stelle alla strada
Essere troppo buoni non paga

Do-domani, do-do domani, domani, do-do domani

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (domani)
E se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

Oggi c’ho in testa te, non so perché
Domani chissà, perciò se ti va senti qua
I ricordi sono in fila e non mi mollano
Ad uno ad uno salgono e mi tormentano

Sono in para-noia dura, dolce tortura
Paura, come quella sera
Indeciso sul baciarti o meno, a parlare sul divano ore
La prima volta che assaggiavo il tuo sapore

E già ne ero strettamente dipendente
Shhh, cotto immediatamente
Ed era tipo “che c’importa di domani? Stringimi le mani”
Ma I baci non risolvono i problemi

E ora non ci sei, domani è già arrivato
E brucia dentro sai, anche se ero preparato
E cadono parole come pioggia sulla strada
Forse verrà domani il sole che le asciuga

Non so dove mi porterà questa marea
A largo o a riva non ne ho idea
Se con qualcuno o se con te
Non so domani neanche se sarò con me

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (domani)
Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

L’autostrada scivola veloce
Sto mangiando quel gelato che ti piace
Che ti fa ingrassare tutte le menate
Quante volte le ho sentite
Mi gira in testa ancora la tua voce
Dolce musica, pure quando isterica
Quasi psichedelica, senza dubbio erotica

Ah, e pensa a quanto spesso son finito nel tuo letto
A smaltire quel gelato, a restare impigliato
Nei tuoi capelli con il mio orecchino,
A fare casino, per farmi stare zitto mi schiacciavi
Sulla bocca il tuo cuscino.
Fumare sigarette, raccontarti barzellette fino al mattino

E mi divertivo quando mi correggevi se sbagliavo un congiuntivo
E come t’incazzavi quando t’abbracciavo
E non m’ero tolto l’orologio e ti graffiavo
Cento volte buonanotte e non dormivo, ti fissavo
Poi mi muovevo e ti svegliavo
“E lasciami dormire Ale, ti prego”
Ed eri così bella che non ci credevo

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (domani)
Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

Forse domani un nuovo vento
La mia passione soffierà via (domani)
Chissà domani quale fuoco ecciterà i peccati miei (domani)
Perché domani non ci sei, perché domani non c’è “noi”
Perché domani, c’è solo domani (domani), domani

E ancora cambio umore se ti penso
È un bel po’ che non ti sento
Ma non mi frega cosa stai facendo
Dentro ho un’immagine di te che non parla
L’ho fatta per guardarla e non voglio rovinarla
E tengo solo il buono, come il tuo profumo
Che mi ha sballato più di ogni cosa abbia bevuto o fumato
E mai nessuna foto renderà giustizia al tuo sorriso
Quando esplode all’improvviso sul tuo viso, lascia stare
Domani avrò un altro posto dove andare
E un’altra rima da inventare
E neanche so dove saranno i miei pensieri
Forse sarai solo una luce che illumina il mio ieri

Ma ancora rido se penso ai soprannomi che mi hai dato
Li sapesse anche il mio amico, sarei rovinato! Non credi?
Sono ancora in piedi, e lontano che non mi vedi
Ma oggi tu sei la mia musa, baby
Fata benedetta e strega maledetta insieme
Faccio di te le rime mentre domani viene
La notte muore schiaccio l’acceleratore
Oggi sarà un giorno senza te, domani pure

Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani)
Però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà? (domani)
Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani)
Tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà

Non so dove mi porterà questa marea
A largo o a riva non ne ho idea

O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
E non così
Sono in preda ad una psicosi
Rischio una nevrosi
Mami
Non posso continuare questo andazzo da funky-gigolò
Ogni giorno sul mio palco recita lo stesso show
Di pupe a gogò
Cristallo e Pinot
Dolce vita però
Spesso in stile Peppino e Totò
Le mie ex dicono che sono
Un bastardo bugiardo ma io gioco d'azzardo
La mia vita è un casinò
Ogni sera nel night di King Mauri
Con i ragazzi della banda
Cospirando manco si trattasse di una rapa in banca
Per cacciar la bimba da portare in branda
Seppur la compagnia di pupe non ci manca
Trattasi di avventuriere straniere
Amori che si rivelano chimere
Le puoi vedere sparire
Alla luce del mattino come un sogno
Adesso basta! ora so di che ho bisogno
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Prima o poi io devo metterla 'sta testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Magari una che mi contraddica
Qualsiasi cosa dica
Che non mi faccia uscire con gli amici
E poi mi porti al cinema
Io, lei ed una sua amica
Che mi ripeta
Che sono disordinato
Che mi chieda
Se ho bevuto
Che quando sono affamato
Sia a dieta
Che non mi creda
Se sono sincero
E se mente lei
Pretende
Che me la beva
Che mi telefona mentre sto lavorando
E se le dico che al momento
Sono occupato ti richiamo
Quando la chiamo dice che non l'amo
E fa l'offesa
Che abbia la pretesa
Che ogni giorno le faccia una sorpresa
Sììì
Mi ci vuole un pò di disciplina
Che mi obblighi a svegliarmi presto la mattina
Che mi faccia stare un'ora a esaminare una vetrina
Che quando danno un filmone in tv inviti gente a cena
Che mi svegli per chiedermi se sto dormendo
Che tenti di cambiarmi
E poi mi accusi di stare cambiando
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché io devo mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuole la fidanzata
Una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto
In fondo la mia vita non è poi malaccio
Con i casini che faccio e i guai in cui mi caccio
So che non è serio cambiare ogni sera
Ma preferisco un'overdose di libertà che una dose di galera
Cattivo coi nemici con le bimbe un agnellino
Ho più pupe io del gangster di Chicago
Perfino al bar del Giambellino
Dicevan che ero un mago mi chiamavan Drago
Mò aspetta che ti spiego
Forse la fidanzata non mi serve come prima ti dicevo
Continuerò a fare zig-zag
Tra soubrette e vedette e tete-a-tete
Con ballerine di
Tip-tap
Ad essere infantile
Ma con stile
Fidanzare me è un'ingiustizia
Per la popolazione femminile
Quindi una alla volta
Avanti c'è posto
Questo è il modo che mi dà più gusto
Quindi è quello giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Così le faccio mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché sto già vivendo in un modo giusto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Nessuno mi fa mettere la testa a posto
O mamma mi ci vuol la fidanzata
Perché per uno come me è questo il modo giusto

Questa tipa, attacca a parlare
Io continuavo a bere, facevo finta di ascoltare
Dopo circa una mezz'ora di stronzate e paroloni
Mi mette una mano sopra i pantaloni e dice
""Ho voglia di pene-pene-pene-penetrare
All'interno del tuo ego per poterne ricavare l'essenza
La dissidenza, e quel tuo sentimento di reazione violenta""
Le dico, ""senti bella, adesso ti spiego
Ho voglia anch'io di penetrare, ma non certo il tuo ego
Ma la tua fig-fig-figura di donna
Inserita, nella società moderna
Quali sono i tuoi interessi? Cosa ti piace fare?
Quali sono i tuoi progetti per stasera?""
""Per essere sincera avrei un appuntamento
Un corso di pittura, non posso mancare
Stasera ho proprio voglia di usare un pennello
Con un pennello in mano mi posso realizzare""
""Senti bella, potevi anche dirlo
Che avevi solo voglia di prendere il pennello
Il corso di pittura puoi anche lasciarlo
A casa io ho un pennello, lungo, largo, forte e bello
Lo uso proprio come fossi un vero artista
E con il mio pennello sono un gran professionista""

Così la porto a casa mia, lei si siede sul divano
Io mi metto in libertà
Apre la borsetta, si accende una sigaretta
Mi guarda intensamente con la faccia sospetta e dice
""Guarda, non so cosa tu voglia fare
Sono una tipa intellettuale e certe cose non le faccio
Un uomo per potermi conquistare
Deve avere un grande ca-carisma
Cerco un maschio con una grande personalità
Che sappia sco-vare le mie particolarità
Deve essere istruito, intelligente, acuto
A un uomo così darei persino il cu-cuore""
""Veramente"" le dico
""Ciò che di te meno mi interessa è il tuo cu-cu-cuore
Non è per offendere il tuo cervello
Ma siamo venuti qui perché volevi il mio pennello""
Lei mi dice, ""giusto prepara il colore
Ho voglia di scoprire qualche nuova posizione
Ortogonale, mica male però il tuo pennello posso toccare?""
""Tocca, tocca pure ma fai piano è delicato
Non esagerare è appena appena bagnato""
Ma lei non mi sentiva più e pensava solo a quello
E non ha lasciato tutta la notte il mio pennello

J Ax e DJ Jad ancora insieme
E siamo tornati 
E allora?

Muoviti tranqi funky 
Slega i legamenti col tranqi funky
Segui i movimenti tranqi funky 
E le vibrazioni del tranqi funky

Questo suono è funky
Questo suono è tranqi
Perchè io la musica la tratto con i guanti
Slega i legamenti
Se mi senti ti accendi
Delle vibrazioni segui i movimenti
Facce sorridenti e beviamoci una birra
Ma poi scendi giu' in pista
Se non ti piace il ritmo hasta la vista, vai pure via
Sono io l'animatore che sta sulla regia
L'intrattenitore
Che viene dal quartiere
Tu muovi il tuo sedere
E fammi fare il mio dovere
Sai che tranqi significa tranquillo
E su questo funky mi scialo e non strillo
Come il parmacotto
Accattativillo
Dimmi sai il mio nome? Si
E allora dillo JAx
E tranqi funky è il nome del mio ballo

Muoviti tranqi funky

Ogni nota è un'atmosfera
Questa sera un po' speciale, se lo vuoi
Muoviti tranqi funky con noi

E mi ricordo i tempi
In cui eravamo in venti
A muoverci col funky
Oggi siamo in tanti 
E domani saremo sempre di piu'
E adesso muoviti con me
Ai piatti DJ Jad
Butta giu' la base
E quando entro in fase
Ci sputo su una frase
Come sempre
Rigorosamente
In rima
Funky sinfonici, oggi come prima
E ba-ba-baciami piccina 
Sulla bo-bo-bidibobocca piccolina
Muoviti arrapante tipo play
Metti play poi ok
Tutto fila liscio come con i Casadei
Hey ci sei? ci siamo, andiamo
Sono appagato in pieno, vi amo Vi amiamo

Di voglia di parlare ne ho poca
Ma è inutile parlare se nessuno
Ascolta
Dunque io ringrazio tutti quanti
Specie la mia mamma che mi ha fatto cosi' funky
A me piace la musica quando trasmette i sentimenti
Dire le mie cose senza complimenti
Bere birra, fare tardi, accidenti
Ballare con le tipe con i vari strusciamenti
Yahoo Sono in posizione
Portare il funky nella mia nazione
è la mia missione
Se vuoi darmi una mano fatti avanti
Scendi in pista tranqi
E ballati sto funky

J-Ball,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day

Yo, I'll fuckin, I'll
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fuckin' ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin' G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you,
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin' up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses
And close it back with a lit match in it

But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there

I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray every night (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk

Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her

Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager

I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin he're?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games

We don't play those games

Got me on the run

I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

[Chorus]

I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock
And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over

I'm comin' straight for your goods, nigga I don't want your lil' hoes
I seen ya smokin' opthimals in your benz at my shows
I'ma wait and be patient
Your boy was flossin' on Daytons
Caught him at the right time
Tec-9 bullets went to flyin'
One got hit in the spine, but he made it, that was luck
why'all drawin' plans to see the man, lil' Frankie here, so what's up?
I drew some plans of my own
Your partner's home all alone
Shouldn't have been slippin', hollow tips gone have him sleepin' too long
Beams work better than a scope
He got a red dot on his throat
I pull the trigger, now yo niggas moppin' blood off the floor
I'm screamin' all out wars
I'm runnin' back to my car
Bitches gone bleed to they death
For fuckin' round with a vet
I got'z to finish my mission, pipe bomb, hit the ignition
Only nigga wishin', mashin' out in the expedition
All black chucks, black jeans, and a black hoodie
Smoked out, puffin' on a Keep Movin' goody
Fully paid from jackin', I'm stackin' a nigga shit
Will invade your mansion, and snatchin' what we can get
Guess you didn't see us comin' 'cause we came in the dark
Blew that ass up, like it's centennial park
Bombs Away!

why'all thought Insane couldn't flow
But I took control of the show
And these soldiers ain't lettin' go til' your people hit the floor
i got'z to get to your G's, 'cause mine come on a freeze
I smoke a gang of that weed, then I straight be blastin' with thieves
Goin' all out for this shit
How many domes I'ma split?
I'm just a hustler from the door with a hundred chickens to get
Your day gone fade in the black
The camp be on the attack
You think it's cool? I got my strap, I blast ya clean off the map
I'm representin' Big Boy
Killer men takin' they cars
Got twenty G's, and I'm jettin'
Loaded nine, fuck a Smith & Wesson
Bullets made for cuttin' and bustin' a nigga chest
Dynamite, one light put your whole firm to rest
Hate to be the nigga had to find that bloody mess
Nose still hurtin' from inhalin' the burnt flesh
Niggas gotta wear a vest, for fuckin' round with the best
I'ma psycho sniper killa, on the foreala
Thrilla from Manila, quick to fluffin' your coffin pillow
Hit'cha for your scrilla then crack the top on the 'ze
And when you make it, tell your maker that Insane don't play

I'm standin' over your shoulders
Right there in the middle of your crib

I bet you bitches never disrespect the camp no more
I roll with nathan but felons
Soon as they finish we bailin'
J-Dawg be chokin' your bitch, for all the screamin' and yellin'
Never had love for no hoes
I hit that hoe with bow-lows
She got some knots on her head
Her man about to be dead
Grab my weapon, ain't no time for guessin'
That's out of the question
Niggas tried to blast me, cop killers taught him a lesson
Four niggas against a veteran
Can't win, in this profession
My life, be like a mission
With Tokyo ammunition
I'm wishin' I catch'em slippin'
One of them niggas missin'
Big Mitch in the other room
With a bomb strapped to the broom
We made it out to the van
He got the switch in his hand
That's the plan
Make them bitches think they gettin' away

Like I really want to see the shit, a drunk ass slut and her fuckin titty,
And when it comes down to the sex part, they say love shit and try to soften my heart.
But a bitch will always give more head, with a cold double barrel pressed againt their forhead.

In my neck of the woods Id'a never met fear.
Me and the boys the rumblin we always drop the hoes even though I might be fumbling.

There rollin hp's. it'll never end, 'cause I saw Johnny butt fuckin one of his friends, 
So there on my case about it, because I told everyone he likes to suck a good dick.
Now were all grippin in a 68 bucket
Seen a fine bitch, but I said fuck it, 'cause I know how that story goes,
First she buys me dinner, then I fuck that hoe.
But I was in a hurry to get down town , A yo Mexican festival, you don't want to miss the show, with brews and faygo we was chillin too much never stop and my homie Kid villain
there's mother fuckers starin at me all night, given me a look like I was fuckin his wife.

Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer

He goin' lead to where he at, I been in the going stuff for crack and that
Big homie knew I had it on my mind
He ain't like it but it right that run it through my bloodline
He knew what he decline and what goin' be hard for me to find
So he choose to put me down, and I got up on my grind
The dawg and you hoes say I'm glorifying crack
My momma lights off, the whole house pitch black, bitch!

Refuse to talk about just, cars and bling-bling

No more crying, no more tears 'cause ya champion is here
I'm the superman you seek, I sweep ya off ya feet
From the moment our eyes meet, girl, you in for a treat

The attraction is so unique, the conversation is sweet
Love making under the sheets, it'll make the mission complete
Your body language is loud, girl, you speaking it well
But maybe I do the fool, put you under my spell

I'm suave and debonair, you sexy with long hair
This chemistry's so rare, just kick back and chill
Let the moment take control, ya Prada goes my gold?
But baby, let's take it slow, lemme show ya I'm real

If them looks could kill, ya be wanted in every state
Ya body shape is great, collaboratin' is fake
When you open up the gates, be ready to love make

I'm the answer to ya prayers, we make a perfect pair
I handle with great care, I'm packing, girl, beware
Go on, come back to my lair and I'll make you believe

Some slow jams and candle light, make the mood right
I do it just like ya like it, sweat ya out of ya weave
From the second you arrived to the moment you leave
I'll have you huffin' and puffin' but please don't forget to breathe

Ain't no tricks up my sleeve but I know you still debatin'
But baby, no more waitin', it's time for Mr. Slayton
Them other clowns been fakin' but I'm here for the takin'
No worries of baby makin' 'cause I pack a Gary Payton

Me and you layin' naked in them birthday suits
Is reserved in body rockin', baby, knockin' them boots
Now you know you lookin' cute but it's time to decide
All playing games aside, you gon' ride, baby

Get closer, baby, tonight, I'll give you what you need
From the moment that our eyes met
Girl, I knew that you were meant for me
You and me and chemistry

So what you wanna do tonight?
I'm tryna be with you tonight
'Cause you're lookin' so nice
So nice

A bowl of strawberries and some ol' wet rose
Some ya sweet talkin' in ya ear, make ya come out them clothes
When the moon light reflect off the sweat of your skin
I'ma demonstrate, then separate the boys from the men

Lemme swim inside ya ocean, ya body is smooth as lotion
Let's get full of that potion and leave ya head full of grouse
Baby, it ain't no jokin' when I tell ya it's real
So baby, tell me how ya feel, what's the deal, baby?

This is a true story ladies and gentlemen
You might not believe it though
But fuck it, that's why I'm the Ghost

I'm about to open up
Listen, one day I fell asleep and my knife woke me up
He said

Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' bout I get the most action he about to soak me up

So I went to the closet said ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""

You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you

I said I just beat a case daddy
And I'm trying to take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said

Man listen, used the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never

I said hammer take it easy baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while
And then the hammer said ""cool"" cause you know that I feel you Styles

[Chorus:]
I got a story to tell, my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell, my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me
I got a story to tell, my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell, my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me

My knife said to me

I hawk niggas down, bust arteries

And he get bright red for me
Knife you my nigga but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man Haze to get in the zone
I said ""Haze what the hell is up?""
He said

You know how we do, you know that we crew
So where's the vanilla dutch

Rolling something up, 
Thinking about killing every rapper in the game
And holding something up
My haze said to me

You need to calm down when the rage come to you
'Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you
But you don't give a fuck 
So just open up your book and let your page come to you

Even though I'm humble and noble
I don't give a fuck
You ain't tryin' to hear me I'ma shoot through your mobile
It's funny, I'll stalk you
Hold up my niggas, it ain't a convo 'less your money start talking

[Chorus]

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye
I said money you the root of evil
How they print ""In God We Trust"" knowing what you do to people
But I'm a hard felon
So I grabbed two stacks, dirty and bloody cause I heard my car yelling

J-Ivy,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get
Get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin' legend and I'll tell you why

J-Ivy,"Yeah, yeah, yeah

I, J, I wanna write somethin' immaculate
'Cause that's what you are
I would say you're bright, like the little lights in the night
But you're so far, beyond the stars
Me lady you're bad like the water found on Mars

You see when she places the violin
Under her chin and begins
A melody breezes through the atmosphere
Like angel's wind

Her harmony feels right like when angels bend
When she strikes a chord, my Lord
She impacts the earth
Like Mr. Bojangles tappin' in Timbs

With her, no, my flow can't be down, I scribe of fountains
'Cause she makes me feel like I can climb mountains
Like Proto in Sound
Isn't it obvious this ma'am isn't merely a queen
This clearly, this gift is Miri, Lord of the Strings

I can't fake this, I can hardly wait
Either way you got excited

¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

(¡Es el turno del gorila!)
Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal
Yo no vo'a atacar si tu combo saca'l* (¿?)
De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Tienes que ser el flow, brother!
A la buena o a la mala!
Cohitre de monte!
Y es que son años, mi pana, luchando!
Imagínate, ""Las Gárgolas"" otra vez!
El mismo flavor, otra vez!

Y la nueva generación!

Ay world, this Streets 101

Derty run his mouth 'til the album drop (why's that?)
TrackBoy beat like a freak, work a king on the block
I'm seventeen, name ain't same on the block
And beat and knock the nigga out his frame on the block
And he'll come through and let rang on the block
And all they got to say is it's a shame on the block
I'm hot HOMEBOY! don't ever get it twisted
Number's unlisted, stayed in 3rd district
For real, I'm ready to get naughty
Best of both worlds so, hey shawty!
Show me the party, and I'll show you the coke
I can show you my dick, you can show me your throat
If a nigga trip-trip then we'll show him the fo'
If his niggaz run up to you, we'll show him so mo'

When I put that on the hood, I'ma strike back
And niggaz talk shit, but I don't like that
Sayin' I don't like G, but I ain't write that
And baby mamas mad they ain't 'bout shit
Basically what I'm sayin dude, fuck a bitch
And if I had two, I'd touch a bitch
In the same breath turn around and touch her clit
And nigga if I said then I fuckin' meant it
And nigga if it's rented I ain't fuckin' in it
TrackBoyz give me money so I fuckin' spend it
y'all roll Sprewells but not the authentics
And fuck ya-fuck ya fo' and ya roof clown

Yeah, Yeah
Yo, two step wit' me, two step wit' me

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the nineth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore

Here comes the three to the two, to the one
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from a hun
While she goin' down I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass now I'm lookin' at her thighs
Why she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl you 21 girl that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' wit' those fries
If so baby, can I get them super-sized?

Here comes the four to the three, to the two
She stay feelin' on my Johnson, right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' thats cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run wit' the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

Three, then comes the four to the five, to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man, son of a bitch
Brushed it off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Wit' some orange juice man, this some good 'ish
Homeboy trippin' cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my click

It's cool if I bring my other cats
From St. Louis on this one?
Come on.

Girl as you came through the door, you heard it before
Err'body in this bitch better hit the floor
Your man got some money, but I bet I got more
I heard he got a Bentley, but I bet it ain't a Zoure
She braggin' bout his Cadillac, bitch I got four
She keep runnin' his mouth I might go climb in four more

I like 'em heavily beated, conceited, you can't beat it
Bust some pussy like a cookie with no milk I can't-can't eat it
Okay you love me? No lie, but watch it my charm bright
That don't mean that you can kick it, from grippin' my arm tight
Plus you lookin' good, that-that I can't perform right
In a U.S. club, down the lot p-p-pourin' right
Jamaica born, I don't mean to toot your horn right
But ya' ass super fat, w-w-was you be born right?
And right now, I'm just chillin' with Murph Dert!
Your girl's in the club, but feelin' on Murph Dert!
And half of these hoe's be askin' for Nelly team
I don't know where Nelly team, but I know where my ding-a-ling

I beg yo' pardon I've been pimpin' since kindergarten
She had the nicest boobies and remind me of Dolly Parton (Tits)
My first grade teacher bought my first set of markers
My second grade teacher, she kind of favor Ms. Parker
Third grade, I switched schools, then my teacher was a dude
He taught me how to pimp the teachers into breakin' the rules, shoo'.
My fourth grade teacher man she had a badonkadonk
If I would shot from a ""A"", she would give me a couple points
Fifth grade, I exposed my first ass, 
Sixth grade, I skipped my first class
Seventh grade, is when I first smashed
Eighth grade, I smoked my first grass
Uh, I'm not a bad dude been on more backs then tattoos
Girl's scared to say ""Hi"" so they just blush and just ask you
To ask me, autograph, pictures and hugs

And what's ya' name? 
My name Ali, I want to stick it to ya'
Now as I sit there and check ya', ya' lookin' kind of tight but you act too fly to me.
Push this thing in ya' mouth and right before I nut I pull it out and get ya E-Y-E.
Now you know I go hard on them know, got a pimp card that I show

All I need is a sign
Lord, just give me a sign
Can you just, just show me a sign Lord

Dig it I dug it, some hate it some love it
Politic in the game, I'm just a puppet for the public
If I, spit it you can quote it
If you, read it then I wrote it
Knew it's dirty in this bitch y'all let me in it so I sold it
Niggaz pussy (Why?)
'cause they givin they clothes up
Sayin that they pimpin' but really givin they hoes up
Am I sick, exactly, from takin care of the family
Carry a scar on my nose, that came from my granny
A major player in this game, knew it since day one
Lookin for shit to be the same, nigga keep waitin
I done done, all I can do for the streets
Humble now I'm waitin to see what the streets do for me
Got a child, so I'm like payin support
Still a child, now who the hell payin support

Still rappin, while watchin my papers stackin
Tryin to leave coke alone but the streets callin me back in
And I ain't actin, watchin homie subtracting
Check the murder rate I ain't lyin that's a fact and
I'm from a city where they want they corners back
Body bag, toe tag if you don't know how to act
Picture that, niggaz straight scrambling for crack

Straight 2 faced like them niggas at Sony
(now ain't you the mayor)
I'm the one and only
For the longest me and my niggas 
Been hittin this town like a storm
And now you gotta see me and Penny arm to arm
One day you'll get it 
Keep tryin nigga
Yeah right you ballin, keep tryin nigga
I know a lot of ballers 
Half of em' hate me
Bankrupt, bitch you must ain't see my moms lately
Be damned if you like me
Give a fuck what you rate me
I only know 2 words
And nigga that's pay me
Now we finna stop talkin shit about J.D

I thought you knew Kwon keep 8 on the waist line
I'm from the Lou
Kwon flip H to waist time
I spit it, for niggas who don't fee my shit
She a whore I don't like her 
You can get on my bitch
She want a war, what for I'll peel this bitch
Body lifted gun wit it I don't need this shit
You my enemie
Dressed in my friends clothes
But when I shoot I do better
Than Shaq doin free throws
A bunch of niggas trippin 
That got the game wrong
A bunch of niggas fealin like me who bumpin' the same song 
I'm evil, why you think you goin take my spot
Waitin till my album drop quit thinkin you pop
And you rappin hard core 
When oyu knowin you pop
And you sayin you a realla when you knowin you not

Ya know, right now, whatever you smoke
Right now 'cause they ask me, and they ask me
And they ask me, they ask me

[Verse 1]
Now they ask me 
How you know so much at 17
What you mean?
You never seen a dysfuctional teen
Mama cared for me 
Papa wasn't there for me
Older brother sold dope and murph blurr for me
Times got hard I had to get harder
Let me take that back I had to get smarter
16, I had me a daughter
Hold up J-Kwon lets get shit in order
Baby mama that's a whole 'nother story
Both too young both too horney
Cell phone rung, but I didn't anwser
Check my voice mail, my grandma got cancer
Now she layin' up in a old folks home
When it seamed like yesterday she was home
A month later stroke poped up 
Her brain cells gone
The last thing she said was let no one steer you wrong, I'm grown

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
They ask me, do I believe in God
So I ask them, did I defeat the odds

[Verse 2]
Shit fucked up but I can't turn away now
Sold dope around the town, self esteem way down
Jessie made me tougher, he boxed me up
My mama put me in the system, she locked me up
Now this around the time that we lived on hanley
When I think about it I don't know none of my family
Except, for the immediate ones
that's why I run to the streets and the jennings hand guns
He don't talk much so everybody want to fight him
Every school I went to nobody liked him
Never could it be right
I'd try sometimes
So I chilled by myself and cry sometimes
And all I ask from Gods to buy sometime
Would I bring his name in it If I was lyin'
Now look at what the fuck I did, done
Terry Jones last son, this is a blessing
I'm grown

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Now they ask me how you know so much at 17
What you mean
You never seen a dysfuctional teen
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, woah

Let me take that back I had to get smarter

Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour

Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores

If not I gotta move on to the next whore

If so baby, can I get them super-sized?

Here comes the four to the three, to the two
She stay feelin' on my Johnson, right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' thats cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two

Knew you had freak in ya blood from the get go
Yo' you showed a nigga some love from the get go
Cute too, so you ain't get caught in the image
Friends got in I shouldn't of tossed out our business
So religious, yeah
In other words, sorry couldn't explain the way I was feelin'
Back to the story 'member when we used to hit concerts
Mainly legit and Nore's
Tryin' to get on that was exciting for me
And exciting for you that was something to see
Plus you had ass and I loved that
Back in this I was ya boyfriend I rubbed that
Tryin' to get on, girl I achieved that
Everybody hands out from you I received that

I just want to have you here wit me
I'm there for you, always be true

I'll be there and I'm always goin' back em'
I'm there for you, always be true
It's just you and me you and me (I can't promise that)

How you said them words it had to be love
Basically it had to be us
Against the world not giving two fucks
But know soon as shit picked up
I start actin' different so you switched up
I don't blame you, but I blame us
Kept shit smooth even when it got rough
But, I don't see that no more
Got one half our wait hope he sore
What the fuck is hopin' for
When I can't be the man I used to be no more
No time, we don't go out to eat no more
Barely home, you don't see me before you sleep no more
You love me, and I know you ain't playin'
'Cause the first week gone, you callin' me sayin'

Business got good, but we got bad
Money got happy, but we got sad
But in the midst we had a daughter
Even though we floatin' clear like ocean water
Came home two bags of Fendi
It was gone that started to offend me
Child support hit, that really offend me
Puffy was right it's all about the benjie's
Bitter now 'cause the loves still in me
In my boxers on couch, sippin' Remy
Thinkin' that she need to be killed like Kennedy
Then I listen to I got the remedy
After all I still give you what you need, 'cause we got a daughter to feed
Though you supposed to be here at least you sold me that
Why the fuck did I listen when you told me that stupid

Dis the new improved hood hop
A nig girl mutha fucka in this bitch do the wop

I ain't tryin' to change hip hop
Put money aside and make your hip hop
Not dirty right always flip flop, ding
More flip cot, dirty pick rocks

G.I . just lean on 'em
Bitch, get scared and swing on 'em
Problem too big, put the team on 'em
They still running up, put the beam on 'em

I don't give a damn if you dun like me
I ain't gonna do the right thing, I ain't Spike Lee
Lopside 9 in your ice tea, choke 'em
While I sex 'em like Ike T.

St. Louis ain't ridin', that ain't likely
I roll with some real fellas that on strike three
Snatch ya ass up if you strike me
You ain't happy with that coward, then bite me

Now do you gotta gun?
Welcome to tha hood
Gotta pocket full of crack?

Uncle Tars said the gang needs me
So I keep the red bling to make the aim easy
You put me on gang the baby train weazy
An? all he told me dude pimpin' ain't easy

You used to pop big poppa work
Now my diamonds big and blue like Papa Smurf
And rude I'll pop a jerk
Had my homie ride his brothers now his pockets hurt

Like Jay I did it my way
I didn't get it here from freestylin' Friday
Kwon dun care if and or talk child ways
I got work up and down King?s Highway

Plus you bring the hood to the rap gangs
Wanna bet, some like the crap gangs
Rings these gangs better have my exact change
Before I run in the boy and clap thangs

Third gifted so I represent
I the white city you look like a peppermint
Shake your frame, it's what's on peppermint
Cops can't spray dudes face with peppermint

Man, 'cause I put thern on 'em
Every start, put the whole 9 on 'em
Every spark, now the dirt land on 'em
Who's my bad found out it was laying on 'em

Got a flat, needa car-jack
Betta yet, needa strap that's the car jack
Crack Boyz where the stores at
Have you gotten to the track like top cats

Now I never leave my hood dirty
If I fell, then the money got my hood dirty
Even when I get this brick thirty

J-Kwon I'm known to stay pretty, when they
From the lou' we known to stay pretty, we be
Like the shine, I'm just like get it, get it
Do it mix, since when I said get it, hit it
No it don't but it sound good when I did it, did it
True gangstas, girl they let me hit it, hit it
Then we pass 'em, when they show off them

Now shorty you know how I do when I'm off in the club
Sipping apple juice too young to sip the bub
With my whole crew, about ten or fifteen thugs
All up in here, we not giving a what
And then I spotted shorty
Looking good and she's calling me
Small jeans, cute, had on a baby-tee
Looking like she want to get with me

Shorty! I came to get down
Well don't mess around in this party
I'm grinding on you, you grinding me too
Shorty! I'm feeling you, you're feeling me in this party
I know that you're down and baby I'm down

Shorty's dancing all over me
I can feel the heat and girl you're sweet
The way you're grinding to the beat
Baby drop it, nonstop, back it up, shake your butt
Bring it on, baby I can see your thong
Now baby get in front of me
I like the way you move your body
The way you're looking at me
It's got me going crazy out of my head

Don't mess around in this party

Get, get to get it girl
So go on and get, get to get it girl
Another round of bub, 'cause she love this thug money
She love the club, c'mon

Yeah, uh

Let's Do This

[Chorus]
Look uh
Money ain't never move me
Dog, this ain't a movie
This is real life, so why you tryin' to do me?
Sit back and relax and think about the past
And make your next move your best, it might be your last
Look
Money ain't never move me
Bitch this ain't a movie
This is real life, so why you tryin' to do me?
Sit back and relax and think about the past
And make your next move your best, it might be your last

Look
Money don't make the man
But still, I understand
If you ain't gettin' dough, what the fuck you in this for?
I see you chasin hoes, and all your fancy clothes
You say you hate the music, then why you at the show?
What all that yappin' mean?
How the fuck that fit the plan?
Where the fuck you from homeboy?
You ain't from my land
I see you in the club, in the corner mean-mugged
With all your little thugs, go pop a bottle of bub
And think about it first
And drink away your problems
Before a nigga out here on the streets help you solve them
See, I ain't mad at ya
I'm just tryin' to relax you
And teach you somethin' homie, before them killers snatch you
I try to keep it thorough
Keith done been around the world
And never understood how a man could act like a girl
But see I'm just a squirrel
And this is your world
And I wish you the best
So get it off your chest

[Chorus]

Louie, done made my purse
Well, he ain't write this verse
Some people put they money first, and don't care who they hurt
Always talkin' bout how they, finna do this and finna do that
Finna get that new Benz and finna buy they girl a Cadillac
I try to mind my business, they strike at me with a vengeance
Don't know I'm young and visicious and know how to throw them fist-es
Say I don't keep it real, (what?) say I ain't got the skill
(we) mad cause I got a deal, give a fuck bout how you feel
I represent the streets and that's the way you gotta be
And when my album drop, some people gon' be mad at me
Bitches don't wanna listen, don't wanna play position
Ain't got a pot to piss in, but they call they self dissin'
Your next move should always be your best move
Never follow what the rest do, and they'll respect you
Cause money come and go, don't front like you don't know
And when it's all spend up and gone, you ain't got shit to show

[Chorus]

Now my baby mama hate the fact, now that I'm gettin' scratch
So she go and react, hold up man, matter of a fact
Now that I'm thinkin' back, when I ain't had no scratch
No ice, or no 'lac, hold up Kwon rewind it back
Now was you gon' react?
That's when I hate the fact, I laid her on her back
(hold up man, don't say that)
Nah, let me spit the facts
Y'all know I love my son, but she only care about if he got some air force ones
Now ain't that shit dumb? Now where we both come from
Like all your life, you grew up running around spending funds
We was broke as Hammer, t-shirts for pajamas
Cribs small as llamas, eating corn flakes and bananas
Now it's vests and Hummers, we fucked the whole summer
The only reason, cause your man be tryin to take me under
So now I sit and wonder, like I ain't got no clue
And yes it's true, that the money might have moved you

J-Live,"With or without the mic when my mind gets phonetic 
The mouth gets kinetically energetic its simple as your alphabetics 
My words you mark and never mock long as my name has been Jean Jacques 
I keep you open like your pupils in the dark. 

Dogs bark at the gate to negate what I create 
Still I write rhymes regardless of the stop signs 
In tough times or nice times 
For shade or for sunshine 
Throughout time all times have been the right time, to recite mine 
To mankind 
Who wants mine, come get mine 
You best combine minds 
Before you cross that fine line 
And say who is so called inclined 
Press rewind 
You'll find if you're blind, you can't see 
How this defines and redefines M you S I see 
Who I be 
H I P H O P, you know we 
As them strangers 
That some wish they could be or not to be 
Impossibly 
As it transcends from hte pen, to the key to the mind 
You will find an emcee, good enough to envy 
As long as I'm alive 
It'll send me to that next shit 
That some just can't get wit' or F with 
My almamada tolf you that ""it don'why quit"" kid, it don'why start until it 
all seems to be so easy 

[Chorus] 
Easy, Emcee is my ambition, The incredible, lyrical and 
original emcee is my ambition 

Who in their right minds thinks they can put a stop to hip hop 
If it don't stop till I stop 
And I don't stop till it stop 
Fake emcees that soak props like rag mops must get dropped 
Risin' to the top of the bottom 
That's how I got 'em 
If your hearts glass ceiling is my mind's glass floor 
Whose style do you suppose 
Reaches higher plateaus 
While you kick those sellout flows 
In hope to sell out shows 
But get your spots taken easy as the wind blos 
J remains repin all the heads whole steppin 
Whose style shall be the illest 
With or without the weapon 
With or without a doubt I maintain with just the facts 
Improving skills with or without the record contracts 
And yet still 
If that beez the case my presence was a gift in its own right 
So I remain strong 
Long as 
Hands cap on 
Snare drums tap on 
J's word stays bond 
And cornballs who rap get snapped on 
Live lyrics will be just that 
Just phat 
Just right for all those who feel my flavors tight 
I'm dedicated to the flow 
The only way the true lyricist could ever make it seems so easy 

[Chorus]

As I reserve the right to renovate the Raw Shack with lyrical 
scaffolds 
Heads are battled as tracks are travelled 
You're unraveled 
Or should I say unrapped in this world where mics get checked and 
all cornballs get slapped 
Alright rhymes get rewritten 
No bullshittin 
Perfected 
JL run point and stays on it 
Mastered styles look back and laugh at first drafts 
Freestyles make toes want to paydownponit 
Do anything but lay down on it 
Anestesiatics get trapped like rats in attics 
To craftmatics 
but then transform like skilled wax to insomniacs with my name in 
your almanacs infact 
I let my glory be that never ending story 
Like those that still inspire since seven albums before me 
Cause yo 
From this old school comes a new degree 
Yet to be mastered till longevity seems to be so easy",Longevity,1996
J-Live,"Go 
Go to the mountain if you must
Go to the burning bush
Happy would ease your troubled mind
How do the fade just stay behind?

I know you better than you think I do
Don't worry this is why I fell in love with you
The man in the looking glass
Is looking back at you at last

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide

If happy times are too few and far between
It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
So disappear, vanish if you wish
Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go

May not be true to see that you would return one day
But in your present state you may as well not be here at all
You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall

Now presiding in this quarter hip-hop
Justice, my rap forté
Judge, jury, bailing for prosecuting D.A.
Et ceteras, paraphas
My modus operende
It's carpe diem whether the fact or word is your way
Comprende?
The people versus, you ain't no Sensi
Teaching that style of word-play
We got the words they
Regardless of what your friends say
They're all disable
Striken from the record and deemed indimissable
And this long arm of the law grabs a mightier
Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
The sentence of this live litigator
Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim
What they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as in' with lies will
I brew skill with free fills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

Baby I don't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, 'cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth

Cut you in half then watch you fall like Darth Maul

Soundin silly like Wesley Snipes needin a sun tan

J-Live," 
Let me tell you about the time I had to solve this case
When some crab motherfucker straight invaded my space
It was approximately 8:47 P.M.
I was on my way home comin' back from the gym
My muscles kinda ached, they felt rigid and stiff
But my mind was at ease from this Coltrane riff
Playin loud... out at Fulton and Truce
?Till a Jeep drowned it out with Xzibit and Snoop
As I get closer to the heezy baby
Certain parts of my body started actin' crazy
My ears got to twitchin' and my right hand shook
I had the sudden need to speed so I decided to book
As I arrived on the block to see a bunch of kids scopin' out my building
Noticin' the door wide open
As I jetted up the stairs past signs of forced entry
Expecting to see my humble abode stripped empty
Oh hell no!

(ah, ah, ah, ah,) X8
Ay yo, my trip from the front door to the second floor
Had me feelin' so alone, embarrassed and insecure
My worldly possessions that I cherished in pride
Flashed in a matter of seconds before my eyes
But not photographic, more like alphanumeric
You know, VCR, TV, laptop, C3
VS, MP, LP, CDs
RL, (?), N-I-K-E
Not to mention USA and RC3C
That opened up in D.C. for Run DMC(?)
This has gotta be a nightmare, somebody pinch me
When up the stairs I see my ten-speed GT
Right where I left it, rather bizarre
Still felt violated, my apartment door was ajar
As I stormed in, thinkin' it's about to be on
The window was wide open, but nothin' was gone
As I dashed to the edge I held my head past the ledge
I seen two hooded figures jumpin' over a fence
They was way beyond capture, so I took a step back
So I could figure this shit out 'cause it was getting intense
The computer was on, file cabinets wide open
Bookshelves was tipped over, they searched, but didn't steal
Wait a minute, the picture from my built-in safe
Was slightly tilted to the side, I was beginning to feel
The same tingling in my fingers and hands
Everything else in the house was there, so work with me one time
But my instincts failed me not
The safe was blown wide open
They stole my priceless book of rhymes!
Oh hell no!

(ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah, shit I've been hit, Elizabeth this is the big one
Fuck it, these niggas got me pullin' out my big guns
So be it, so what if they got it? They can't have it
Dagnabit! The last thing I needed was static
But I got a briefcase for just such an occasion
So I grabbed it, jetted downstairs, hailed a cab
I knew this shit was gonna happen, I was gettin' too nice
From the briefcase I pulled out a homin' device
Three times better than lowjack, these MC's is so whack
That now they gotta resort to stealin' my text
As I fixed on their position for my intercept mission
The cabbie was feather-footed, it was getting me vexed
As we headed toward Jersey the signal got stronger
Even in the tunnel was right on they tail
A green Volkswagen had the nerve to blast ragged
A dead giveaway, now watch justice prevail
I told the cabbie get closer, but he had no heart
Next thing I know we was like five blocks apart
But they was headed for the airport, a getaway plan
Traffic was getting' thick, so I got out and ran
Followed the signal all the way to this drive in hanger
These niggas wanna... with a lear jet?
I drove a luggage cart up the runway to no avail
They pulled out just in time, but I'm not done yet
So watch this

You think you can get away clean?
I know every rhyme in that book
You got five seconds to turn that plane around!
It's like that?
Aight, then!
If I can't have it, no one can!

The way a song sounds better on stage

And rhyme books get better with each page
What before the first bar was written
A first verse was spittin
Before label execs was bullshittin

Before food was bitten, consumed through a nipple
I'm talking about when times were simple
To make a long story short it goes

Port-au-Prince Knoxville Anvan love and the city that never sleeps
From thought to finish I was born just a couple of weeks late
Stayed home longer just to make sure everything was on straight
All systems go cut the umbilical cord

From old earth to new earth Manhattan to turf
For what its worth my mum held me down one deep
Pops was absentee but minds you don't sleep
It took her feelings to raise me lean taught me how to read

By the time I went to school I was in high speed
Ready willing and able jackie taught me how to add with
Dried up black eyed peas on the kitchen table
And coming home to a mothers love and good care

Never wanted it was always enough
But when it came to education its like she had one rule 
There's no such thing as too much school
Not to mention lean taught me how to play the piano and then

Every summer I was out in south ben
Grandpops a bartender at a country club
Me and my cousins from grand rapid was living it up
Me and granny watching ??? football golden blue

She said you can't beat the team and them be	's too
Some say I got my sense of humour from her
And I learned patience from making models in the basement
Brookyn, new york to wherever you at

This is autobiographical taking you back
With no time for refrains I barely got enough time to explain
How hip hop captivated my brain
My mama raised me on soul and beethoven

Sports clubs from private school put me up on soft rock
That was cool but I left Z100 and WGLJ
To find bliss with real s and kiss
Video music rocks showed my what time it is

Wrote my first rhymes as corey but j-live was sparked
Making pause mix demos with my main man mark
Playing ball in the park, there was other heads too
I was the herb of the crew, then I learned what to do

Got my way from school started battling fools
G nice my friendly rival at the lunch table
He started spark at a dark with damian and I date
I was down for a bit but that was just a DJ

Starting spinning in the PJs with satcho and them
Back and forth from the tables to the pad and the pen
Then I had to do a bit upstate but wait
I wasn't incarcerated but college educated

As soon the Albany I was a full time student part time emcee
At the time raw shack was the place to be
Living on judge Clark
Started building with gods

16 man squad
By the time knowledge was 120 we was just 5 deep
I went from Mecca to Albany a student and landed in medina as a teacher
I had this rhyme reacher

We recognized what what's happening
I'm making records and I'm winning
But that's another story and it's only the beginning

Loni Smith and Loni Lin
They sorta share a common sense
And if you spend enough time
Listenin' to me
Then this is what you'll find
Inside my mind's contents
It reads like Chronicles 13
The Constitution
The Kama Sutra
Morrison, La Ruda
Buddha
Mansa Musa
Pharaoh Monch & Pharaoh Sanders
It seems I got low tolerance
And high standards
Seems I got questions
That defy answers
If you were rich while I was starving
Tell me
How are we crew
I'm feelin' like a throw-away-blue
Like God's first draft of the sky
Balls it up for something new

I been
Listenin' to records I've collected
Records I've selected
And inspected
Dissected on examination tables
'Til my technique was perfected
Records that have served and protected
A confidence
In my own perception of the world
Once the wax is reflected
I found myself connected
To the music
Like the lyrics were injected
So now when times are hectic
I close my eyes and listen
To the words
Like advice from somebody
I respected
When I was found dejected
That saying about art and life
Is really just the half
When you recognize
That music is math
Like a true song
Is really just a product
On the answer sheet
Life's craft is a scrap
When you show your work
I would listen with a smirk 
From irony to Irief
From Bob Marley smokin? stones
At the building refused
My girl left me
Roberta Flack said
Never you mind
Love may lose
But at least you tried
The wisdom hit me in the eyes
And I almost cried
Stevie Wonder saw my tears
And put the joy inside
Sade showed me a love
That was stronger than pride
Minnie Rippleton
Invited me to come inside
Marvin Gaye taught me
Lessons of anger and time
That's just the tip of the ice berg
Floatin' in my mind
Not to mention
All the jazz and instrumentals
That's essential
And the Hip-Hop elders
That taught me to rhyme
That's why I'm still listenin'

Kola Rock:

I'm competent with competitions
I'm competitious
I'm compliment my compositions
With lots of pictures
An album full of mental photographs
And sorted similes
Back between the documents
Of dowries and pedigrees
Hip-Hop is like my family
On holidays we bitchin? like
Why you don't freestyle no more!?
I'm better written
I like to place my posture
In a positive position
I like to be the conduit
Controlling my condition
I'm sittin' on the back porch
Thinkin' and I'm listenin'
To the earth spinnin'
To trees rustle
Wind whistlin'
To the grass being crushed
By the feet of small children
Generations of women
Whose end was my beginning
Settling
The foundation of the building
Settling
Of the foundation of self
Knowin' that my best work
Has yet to be written
I'll probably never press it up
To put on the shelf
But when times are rock hard
And money is skin tight
I'll write my love songs 
On the back of my battle rhymes
The question wouldn't be
If I sold my soul
My soul's been sold
The question is:
Was it worth your dime
Listenin'
Listenin' to this
Listenin'
Listenin' to this

""Give it up! Oh Lord.... give it all to you
I try, but - it's - just -  no - use!""

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Aiyo, give it up, rush you up, no fuss, blood rush
Cuss much, what's mine? You bust nuts, crunch crunch
Spark the bud, what's what, the white King Tut
Out in so-fuck, look who they dug up, yup, it's the Rugged
On the record with J-Live, I could hardly believe this
I never thought I'd be rapping on no record with school teachers
Hair flinch from the eighties, library, lies bury
TV, tell lies visually, kid you wit me, hostility
Humility, hillbilly, gorilla, he mentally illy
Still is he, actually, really killed me, billy
All that stuff you heard about me, is probably true
Heard I got the AIDS virus, I probably do
Ammunition spitting is him, is it, you listening
Littering written, it's in slippers, get the rebel in him
Sticking it with sinners, sizzlin' rhythm, verbally hit him
Did he did it, or did he didn't, admit it
Pretend he ain't offended, the men and women
Every minute they in it, don't be
Every illiterate ignorant critical dissed it
Every idiot that ain't live it, they talking shit
I'm R.A. the Rugged Man, get off, my dick

[Chorus]

[J-Live]
Give it up, for the Gods & the Earths, ladies and gentleman
All the human families, the wicked can't stand me
The righteous man hands me the mic, it's uncanny how
One man's penalty's, is another man's boo-whore
The label pun's ironic, courtesy of this sport
Still can't stop a grown man, from pressing report
A free man can either be freedom or free label
When you spent, what you make, to keep making, you can't save
A damn thing, no savings, that's how life'll enslave ya
That's why I strive daily; to be my own savior
I know when shine glows and reflects in my behavior
So caught in between checks, I spilled it in respect
So give it up, if your mission's belittling my position
As a microphone physician, making you listen
Me and Rugged Man relate, through a previous poem
Like he said, I'm mad famous, for being unknown
On records for ten years, I can hardly believe it
Never thought I'd be perceived, as just some rapping school teacher
Just some dude, that can cut and rhyme, same time
Just some conscious kid, that's try'nna save the world through rhyme
Just another underground, hand-to-mouth microphonist
Stop your mirror rap, just to stop you in your tracks
This will stomp you on your track, justice is not just
Another ordinary rapper, I'm the crown royal block
With a velvet bag, matter of fact, and since the swagger is back
And backed by, a whole nation of millions
You can't hold me, my new floor is my old ceiling
That's why I'm guaranteed, to leave you with something you lack, so just

Enamorada, de ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Oh

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny how

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)

I’m in a mood to get it started
I wanna see you gettin’ down on the dance floor

It’s that classic so remastered funky sound
Whenever you rock with Kool & The Gang
You’re guaranteed to dance

No more standin’ around, get up, get down
If you feelin’ this sound, come on, just give it up
Give it up to me, girl
Everybody put your hands together
Movin’ your feet

Give it up, girl, give it up

Now I know that you can feel the rhythm of the groove
So come on and start, just rock this party
I wanna see you get out on the floor with your dance move

It’s a party whenever the band comes through your town
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with doin’ your thing
So come on y’all just dance

No more standin’ around, get up, get down
If you fellin’ this sound, come on just give it up

I come up from the slums and I run, motherfuckers
No other than the gang, it's the slang and prosper
And bang us mobsters, while claiming oscars
While most niggas froze, they control their coast
They be home and broke, 'cause they've been known to choke
Like Malone, be gone when the playoffs come
But I'm a stay off one, liable to spray off some
Ammunition, I handle missions one on one

Professional Xzibit break you down 
Like correctional Facilitys 
Limit all capabilities muthafuck MC's 
Hard to read like Japanese 
I'm spreading like disease

Cold as Henne-sota 
I smoke 12 MC's a day 
Just to fill my quota 
From forty 0-hio 
All the way to Ore-gin

Down to Mi-ti-ami

Understand me?

Tash: 
So Elizabeth it's MC's 
That's comin' to join ya 
Some will be from NYC And some will be from California 
Cause I drop the lyrics on you 
From beneath the Earth's surface 
Where I write rhymes so fresh 
I try to bite my own verses 
Cause the purpose of my flow 
Is to let you know 
My style is badder than the water 
Down in Mexico 
Cause RICO blend styles like juice and gin 
I got the Likwit shit

J-Ro,"I get drunk and I stumble to the mic
Stay drunk all week, I'm at my peak like pike
I'm never at my peak, I'm killin' fifth after fifth
I drink mo' 40's than Tash and E-Swift

Uh, huh, I drink more than both of y'all
I hold more liquor than a bank on Crenshaw
And Tash you can't drink brew, you know you the nigga who
Be all on yo' nads after just a swig or two

Nigga you trippin', must be that Zima you was sippin'
Yo' accountant couldn't count how many bottles I be grippin'
And flip it in the trash 'cause I downed 'em with ease
While you on yo' knees
(About to pass somebody yo' keys)

I even had to pay the taxi the last time you asked me
You start off on yo' feet but always wind up on yo' back G
Bro you should know you can't drink with Rico
While you down yo' shit slow, I'm on my ninth Cuervo

Aiyyo at every single show, you be layin' on the flo'
Swearin' up and down, you neva' gonna drink no mo'
But I get to' up, from the flo' up, and never throw up
One little wine cooler and you wanna beat yo' hoe up

I never call it quits, I don't know my own limit
This Alkaholiks shit is for real, it ain't a gimmick
You might fuck around and catch a liver disease
Fuckin' with these Likwit MC's, hip hop drunkies

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Curvoiseir, coke and rum
Alize and one five one
Heineken, Hennesey
Juice and gin, brass monkey

Yo, yo, I pledge allegiance to the bottle, the cup and the can
In front of the bar, that's where I stand
And to the alcohol for which I fall
And the cold porcelain in the bathroom stall

One drunk nation under God inebriated
With liberty and justice to anyone who's faded
Drink drink drunk until I can't hack it
Until the little man fall off the horse on my polo jacket

When I get drunk once again
I spent all my yen on ten bottles of gin
Likwit 'til I'm stiff, damn I love this riff
The Ro gotta go, I pass the mic to E-Swift

I drink a lot of beers, my life's a black version of 'Cheers'
Everyday sit at the bar and take shots with my peers
I've been doin' this for years, ain't no amateurs here
I've been drinkin' 40's longer than most niggaz careers

I've got the bitches grinnin' while the whole world is spinnin'
You suffer from double vision and I'm just beginnin'
You always pass out, wake up and don't remember me
You could write a book with all your hangover remedies

I thought you knew, I've been drinkin' since high school
While I down this Olde English, you sippin' your O'Douls
I'm makin' beer runs at ten minutes to two
While you still sippin' on your first motherfuckin' brew

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Curvoiseir, coke and rum
Alize and one five one
Heineken, Hennesey
Juice and gin, brass monkey

A lot of niggaz can't drink, but hoes is even worse
They order three drinks but can't finish the first
I see 'em reachin' in they purse about to roll that sack of weed
Knowin' that's the combination that they really don't need

'Cause girls take a sip, get fucked up quick
Pass out, wake up
(What's this?)
It's a dick
Baby girl, you lookin' sick, you lookin' plastered like a poster
You was talkin' all that shit, now you need some Alka-Seltzer

You wobblin', weeblin', fuckin' up your evenin'
That smoke that you breathin' got that ass on spin
While yo' homegirls is like
(Where the fuck you been?)
In the girl's bathroom, fucked up since ten

Yeah, I seen her, she thought she was a graceful ballerina
Now that ass is too drunk to drive herself to the marina
So she comin' home with me because, I don't give a fuck
Might fuck an ugly bitch, but only when I'm drunk

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

When I get drunk
When I get drunk

We doin' big thangs, knahmsayin'?
Ha ha, we fucked up now
You know what's goin down, Alkaholiks

Yo, who hold guns and rock ice bigger than life
Got bitches throwing they drawers on stage, that ain't me!
I raise kids, push whips, piss an MC
Love money like I love my moms
Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets
Wall to wall bullshit I got hardwood floors
Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine
So why y'all are fucking the same hoes who used to be mine

[Tash]
And I've been waiting three summers to rhyme longside my people
Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal
Dose of hop-hipping if you thought CaTash was slipping
Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sipping
CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

[Xzibit]
Yo you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist, how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew
Yo get rid of the niggas before the same thing happen to you

[Pos]
And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue
Blood leaking out, girls freaking out, motherfucking cops tweaking out
Got you on your knees like a freak, juggling deez nuts

What you know about what's weak, what's tight?

What you know about niggas fronting for the light?

What you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

[Xzibit]
Yeah, yeah, look
I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor
The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol
My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fucking shots I called
My niggas gotta ball, never settle for less
Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts
Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll something
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole something

[Pos]
Yo these style I kick should be called ? rap
Drawing the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet 
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L.A.
With connecting flights to rip it elsewhere

[J-Ro]
Drinking up Black and Tan in the back of a van
 
I learned as a young man, long trip, piss in a can
Getting a house for two grand, now you got your own land
Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan

You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand
Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand
And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty)
Dirty like Uncle Red, hey yo
Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo
Dirt you dishing out, chef telling it all
Face down in the dirt, doing my dirty work
Expert, trying to regulate my network
Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it
If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it

[Chorus]

[Tash]
And I've been known to get it on, past the break of the dawn
Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave 'Potholes in Yo' Lawn'
(C'mon!) You making diss songs? Spit that rhyme my way
I can shut why y'all niggas down like the why-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggas coincide
(Right-right-right) The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album going classic

[J-Ro]
This is for the DJ, bring it back one time
I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme
I'm, old school like my dad is
So add this, to your collect', Plug Won, who the baddest?

[Pos]
Hey yo, we theme park status, upstage these niggas like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blaming they legs, while I'm claiming these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

[Xzibit]
Yeah, we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is making sure that Hollywood burn,
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (Below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box

Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head till his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a ""Black Cop""
X and E's, out for cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uh, give it to y'all, in ""Any Given Sunday""
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot

I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin' ten G's
Cause we need a bag of weed (Can you smell it)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquid by the gallons

[Tash]
Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who want to get it

Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference

When I was a kid I rode crates on a skate 
And I ate everything momma put on my plate 
Niggaz walked around packin BB guns 
Knock on yo' door and run  just for fun 
We went to the sto' and sold bottles fo' a nickel 
To feast upon a big bag of Cheetos and a pickle 
You could get a soda foe less than quarter  and 
People used to speak even if they didn't know ya 
We fought in the streets like little black soldiers 
Shake hands, and still be friends when it was over 
We used to play tag and, hide and go seek, or 
Hide and go get it if we had a few freaks, but 
Now thangs changed, kids ain't the same 
They bang, and slang, and blow out brains 
I wish I could go back but, wishin is for suckers 
Life was so simple then 

[Chorus:]
I remember (I remember) ohh 
When we used to hang 
On the porch, drinkin brew 
And now they drive-by (bay-bee)

But now they gang-bang (bay-bee)

Runnin through the streets of Onessa P-A 
I take you through my childhood step by step 
Daddy always told me to maintain my rep though 
Daddy was a dog he ain't raise no punks 
In the midst of the trees we learned how to thump 
At the tender age of nine momma put us on a plane 
Next stop -- the land of the insane 
Compton California where the killers grow 
Forced to live a life that I didn't know 
Wore the wrong colors cause I didn't know the facts 
Call her bitch, caught a case, caught a slug in my back 
But I adapted quickly, suckers tried to get me 
Now the fools better run cause this just drive-by Billy 
Little black boy from the East 
Forced to be a killer, but I can still remember

You know what I'm sayin? Playin still to the chest 
And I was the best, playin kickball at recess 
I play Pop Warner, golden pairs for the losers 
We used to hop corners on the fresh deuce cruisers 
Playin Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin Reese's 
I had all the women cause my tough skins had creases

[Chorus]

[Vamp]",Dime Piece,2006
J-Rocc,"You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinking with a one track mind
Keep talkin' about heaven glory but
On your face is a different story
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty
Wash out your mouth
Your lies are getting rusty
Can't believe nothing you say
'cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you're funky as a mosquito's tweeter
You gotta mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game, same old thing
You never changed
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing

I got something to tell ya
I got something to tell you baby
But you ain't hip to baby
Blowin' minds is a thing of the past
You blew your chance that's why you never last
You want to be a graduate mother
But in reality just another brother
You think you slick but could
Stand a lot of greasing
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you funky as a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing
You beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

Brought yourself a pot of baked stew
Nothin' worse than an educated fool
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation
But peace and love is a famous generation
What's in your head has really started
Showing your conversation gettin' kinda boring
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you funky as a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game, same old game
Same old thing you never change
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing",[Untitled Track],2010
J-Shin,"Hey cue that shit that the verse mixed up

(See what I'm sayin)

Gotsta hold on
I been trapped for so long
Gotsta hold on
I been trapped for so long
Gotsta hold on
I been trapped for so long
Gotsta hold on

See,
See marijuana got me copin wit my problems
And hennessy got me hopin I could solve em
My baby mama ull of drama
Tryin to scar me
But unlike my old sorry ass father I tried harder
My baby raised to hate her daddy
Her mammy playa hate and wishin that she had me
She hate to see me on tha street
And still on my feet
Betta yet this bitch wish them crackers had me
See everybody wantsa hustle
But dont nobody wanna suffer
Nobody wantsta die cuz they all bustas
And suckaz
Aint never gon have nothin
Cuz they be frontin
Gotta sacrifice
Three time for every dime they be wantin
And believe me
Being a thug it aint that easy
I once was a fool but see they had to free me
I'm undercover man
But still they aint respectin me
Tryin to get the best of me constantly stressin me

hook

We gotta hold on           (hold on)
See you must be strong     (so strong)
Against thug happiness     (gotsta hold on)
You can go wrong           (i been trapped for so long)
For my homies in the hood  (gotsta hold on)
What will you do           (i been trapped or so long)
Which life will you choose (gotsta hold on)

(I been trapped for so long)

See big daddy gave her diamond rings
He introduced her to the finer things
Looked out started buyin her things
Minor things for the small change
And had her off the chain
And it's a awful thang
She aint even cost a thang
Even though I'm thugged out
She loved how
I did wrong for so long
And still got by
See thug money got blood on it
Plus it leave residue
Boy I'm tellin you
I put mo bread on it
I lost a homie in the stuggle right
And just the other night
Somebody tried to take my dogs life
Atempted homicide
They outside and aint gon let em ride
Dont wanna talk
And aint gon let em slide
They want war instead
They want more for dead
Rather die open fire or do life for their's
Take a life instead
Kill his wife in bed
Ten times to tha head
what tha shooter said?

hook

See
I thinkin bout whaen i was younger
I had to hustle in the summer
No time for cryin had to help my mama
Any time and any weather
Whatever's clever
And hardly ever never
Had to step and get my shit together
I left my homies in tha pen and reason being
See every man got his own sin
But I'm a always remember yall
Cuz after all yall still my dogs
And when ya jump we can still ball
My nigga Ronnie, Lil Willie and Fat Fred
Big Black, My dog Sparky and Lil Ed
It be times like this
I sit around like this
Cryin bout this
Thinkin why my clicque
Gotta go and die like this
No duckin
No fearin nothin
Hearin nothin stayin rich but buggin
We call that thuggin
But dont be thuggin for nothin own somethin
Do or ya kids and ya mama
Save the drama
Young nigga hold on

hook

Na it aint no time or no suicidal shit nigga
While you still thinkin you a thug
You might as well go head and suffer
Cuz that's what we doin
That's what it's about
I ya forgot",Hold On,1998
J-Shin,"Mama I want to thank you 
For sharing your blessings upon me 
Taking  time to understand the lady I want to be

Yes mama 
Mama I want to thank you 
For sharing your blessings upon me 
Taking time to understand the lady I want to be

This cold world had me num the pain like novacaine
Till mama sat me down unfold the gate
Showed me the straight path through the narrow lane
Sunshine after rain the joy of pain
Mama you raised a good girl don't worry
You used to say take it slow trina don't hurry
Use to tuck me in with the bedtime story
Now I grown up and you still there for me
My shoulder to lean on 
You kept my dreams goin
I owe it all to you me now I got the green flowing
And I'm gon always be yo baby
And I  can't never repay you for all the things that you gave me
You raised me to be a lady
And you scoot me to the game so them niggas couldnt play me
You was more than a mother you was a friend 
The greatest love of all comes from within 
I know ill never kknow love like this again
And beneath my wings you was the wind
I love you like none other
Cause you can only live your whole life but only get one mother
 
Being there for me through the thick and thin
More than a mother your my best friend 
Look within and take yo place

Sometimes I want to run to ya
Through the ups and downs I know I can still come to ya
I think bout the things I done to ya 
But through all the drama I know I'm still number one to ya
Uh, look at how far you brought me 
All the things you have taught me 
Money couldnt bought me
You never wanted us to make the same mistakes
When the game got high and they raised the stakes
You was still in my corner to press the brace
Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe
Through the thick and thin I'm gon be there for ya
I say a prayer for ya 
Lord knows I care for ya 
Through hard times we got strong  or mother to daughter 
When I was weak you was my bridge over trouble water
Can't nobody replace you 
I'm forever faithful
For you mama I'm grateful 
Your baby girl is a reflection of you
I thank the lord up above cause he blessed me with you, uh
I love you like none other
Cause you can live your whole life but you can only get one mother

(yes mama)
mama I want to thank you 
For sharing your blessings upon me (oh mama)
Taking time to understand
The lady I want to be (keep reapeting till fades out)",Mama,2000

J-Status,"It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sunshine through the rain
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby, here I go again

Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then (baby)
My heart remembers when (my heart remembers when)

Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss dem days when we used to chill (used to chill)
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril (West Nigril)

I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train
The way he said my name
The brother had a lot a game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

How am I gonna tell my mama?

Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need

Cash money still a army and I earn my stripes

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm a gangsta millionaire since
You could put me on the scale and weigh everythin'
I'm 36 old fish scale still stand
Then eat the nigga
And I'm gonna ride fo' my people nigga
I'm in the hood where the dudes be
Whoever assumed that me a be runnin' around with c and b
I gotta a army and I'm the general nigga
Money plentiful nigga, then why your old lady into the nigga
I'ma button down bricks and voices off in my head
Like murder bout the spirits and watchin' out fo' the feds
Fo' real I got Mexican friends, I ain't gon' lie about it
And I took a few losses I ain't gon' cry about it
But I'll front you a brick if you down and tapped out
A nigga shot your homie in the head, you just getting high about it
Yo Gotti straight up I'm a snitch killa'
Don't even speak to me Garth, you ain't a real nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Now I'm riding through my town got the key to my city
All the tin mo things brand new in the minute
Every nigga in this mothafucka' no me dog
Livin' legend, ridin' fly, nigga ball til ya' fall
Methomine project where I started the struggle
Gladis run around Sams in the circle we hustle
K.C gave me the game, I took it and tuck it
Nigga brought it to another level cookin' and cutting
From the half 17's, nigga 50 n hundreds,
I done made the Lamborghini's, rolls royces on buttons
And I done did my time, I wouldn't git it, wouldn't git it
And got it on my mind cause it's money over bitches
All the time I'm bout mine, nigga workin' from digits
Green bag full of cash nigga how we feel it
Stunna island poppin' bottles nigga fuckin them bitches
Got the money and fame and them and them come on wit it, mo hundred

Check  check it 

Fuckin with a nigga like myself your lyrics fail 

LaVerne's gear shows your record so molest the hoes buttnaked 

Youse a loser  your crappin shoulda kept it to your lonesome 

But you like  'Look everybody  I'm a silly microphone crumb' 

You oughta turn to me  I flaunt essential vocally 

First team all university while your squad is benchin locally 

Don't mention joke to me, aiyyo dem niggaz ain't atomic 

Ain't the comic niggaz gutsy, after the disembowelin 

Don't fuck around, I eat out with your shorty with the crew 

and she be late for head, she want a tape and dreads 

and thought of you, a little stinger 

My shit'll bring the epitome of bitterly jealous 

Forever living crazy minded trying to tell us 

how you do it on the power-you, it's simple shit'll get props 

Don't let me bring it God I swing it hard like little kid bops 

So front I keep the tone vexin, but to the heads 

stay pleasant to the ears just think of Lauryn Hill on phone sexin 

[J-Treds] 

Relentless poetic rhyme never ceases infinity 

Forever smokin the mic lyric contact I be open 

Naturally high and no need to pass the Dutchie 

I'm the living circle circle dot dot, nobody can touch me 

At my post, the most high exalted, mind blower 

When I rap it it's strictly 'I can't believe he just said that shit' 

Material crews, who can't think straight sober 

My flows over your head, I enjoy the aerial view 

Focus from the bird's eye, in my scenario, of dominance 

Filth eatin weaklings, we're bumRussian/rushin like dirty communists 

Raisin, my Iron Curtain revealin my words the gospel 

No apples or giant serpents, the enlightened apostle 

J-Treds, I lace heads like tennis players top seeded 

Not meanin to cause a racket, or front the menace 

My words speak for themselves, so feel me 

Cause on the mic I've got more presence 

than attendance in a class of schizophrenics, hear hear 

Drink to that pick up raps, intoxicating 

Got your craving my living proof, mixture of speech and wine 

To' up from just the flow but pass the liquor it's over 

Henny dead even when twisted I get open like Venetian blinds 

Company Flow, the fire in which you burn slow 

I remain Indelible

Check check check check check check 

I the Don Digital, slash, piranha morph 

Alongside poor terrible surgeons, who blur comic perspectives 

and wonder how to get bent, that flaming Malatov shit 

Unstoppable object hits unmovable wall and space split 

This rogue cherub got his own twisted agenda, catch that 

Walkin on flatlines, you witness me grow WAY beyond corporate control 

Let them eat cake, cause I introduce myself as a mistake 

Slipped through the quills with a serrated barb stabbed, sharp in the 

gut 

Now we can all become Lord of the Flies 

when this industry sees it's demise 

Hold it up and try to destruct you get zapped with dead eyes 

The five factions giganti the fuck up and get touched 

The group hugs you received from your support group 

can't protect you from the bumrush 

I'm known to slip arsenic mickies and talk shoot then reform 

With an unprecedented fierceness, display these powers of Storm 

I wasn't born in a manger but I still received three gifts 

Alphabetically listed they're Big Juss, Mr. Len, and I 

See the field creatures scurry, I the killer, caution 

Try to merk off of the pile but you choked on my motherfuckin portion 

Spade within my excrement bitch parody 

Your insanity is my clarity, not to mention convention 

is a great war weapon, disguised under the guise of institutionalism 

but still prison, the bad batch of jism 

Who stands, who falls, this is the one the DJ calls lick the ass crack 

On the wack I keep tabs like Timothy Leary and/or ASCAP 

The iron lung is now rustable, you're overrated 

As in smoking dust or sonic contracts that haven't been thoroughly 

debated 

Got my name up in your mouth like cock or gingivitis 

when every rhyme becomes the official new blueprint for wannabe 

writers 

Catch a smack to the face on principle 

Even when I say nothing it's a beautiful use of negative space 

Indelibles is invincible, El-P don't forget the fuckin name 

Come on Columbo I know you figured this shit out, nobody sounds the 

same 

[Bigg Jus] 

It gives me great pleasure when true elements get together 

and lace the track rough enough to withstand, any type of weather 

If you want it I got it, chemically hemming up the seams 

with a poly-epoxy type of a mixture that be, fatal if you sniff it 

These, stupid ones pop the microdots 

then lean into the sound's religion, watch these styles straight box 

you up 

Coming with clean concise thoughts, penetrating patterns 

Not beyond your comprehension but ejected wide beyond the barrel 

Yo, catch the rarest glimpses of the planet once known as Earth 

that gravitated, before inner violence heated it up, then it burnt 

It be these two style slide niggaz who will rock off 

any beat you push 

Cell Therapy Down South Goodie Mob and Special Ed's The Bush 

It's like this, for the niggaz who got caught sleepin and didn't know 

It be these four actors crazy kings, worlds to revolve around CoFlow 

Coming at you in a blazing orange hunting vest thirty yard night scope 

first day of deer hunting, you got scoped out like the foreign Juss

J-Treds,"[Queen Heroin]
Asides from gettin in you, the words will stain you
Permanent like ink in epidermis, from tattoo artists
To scar this, thought of partnership you may have fought
For this position and status, this entrepeneurship
Matter of fact, madness I planned this like serial killers are banished
Flows aquatic like fishes' surroundings, underground and
It's pounding, like pregnancies, with the expectancy
Of three times three, use my mental nine to climb
Like gladiator on wall, on call like physicians
To deliver my labor you savor the flavor like Punisher to the cure
A parent's birth picture, evade mixture of offspring
Ring ring the alarm, cause I set strong cases of fire
From my wire connections and disconnections
To settin sparks cause then I'm wettin, microphone checkin
Disrespectin amateurs plus they mentors don't be a sore sport
If it's meant yours, just pretend I liked yours

[J-Treds]
I can be a bit demanding, acceptin, nothing less than the best
I don't just flip shit anyone can kid, I stick the landing
And stand out, amongst most so don't stress
Trying to touch us, you can't come close like phone sex
I stay ahead of the pack, if you fuckin with Treds
Know that I cover the spread so always bet on black
I'll give you your money's worth, serve up somethin delicious
While, most of these rappers be makin my tummy hurt
Got me upset, sick of these crabs who can't kick it
All addicted to rhyming, I'ma stick them in rehab
Get em cleaned up you know, show em the light that they're
All bark and no bite, like a tree trunk
We slash and burn em, Indelibles, The Fire In Which
Suckers are finished, may they flow, rest in pieces
Cause we're dominating, so while they're busy happy
Just to be nominated son, we give acceptance speeches
Takin the crown, front doors, breaking em down
We some BAD MOTHERFUCKERS, that's what many said
They also said, your time will come, it's time to take it cause
We just couldn't stand the wait like Jenny Craig

[Bigg Jus]
Now that's my man the scripture puzzler, bringin a pain device disguiser
For infinite wisdom seeker knowledge of life rhyme provider
?on dudes that just strip time codes down for my feet?
To master one-twenty-four bits at ninety-six KhZ
While you just now trying to get up on Dungeon D&D
Thinking Indelibles will crash and burn you must be lazy and obscene
We fire sequential flyers, my verse ?provides wrecks in concert D?
Slingin em 40 bottles frozen from rooftops and projects
Beware watch below for falling objects, rupturing your optical
Two one-hundred watt mono blocks is optional
To try to match wits with the Diamondback unstoppable
Background poseurs fiend for limelight exposure
When we rally back touch the microphone playtime is over
Who's trying to see the CF graf crew that visualize
Top to bottom, and stand out in New York like an L.A. gang tag do
Master of mathematical empirical principal
Metallic medicinal, mixed with herbs, science and mineral
Yo crews start to walk, when we crack the five series hood
Disengage the ?passive, rip open an issue casing?
Trying to sidestep backwards when it's this rhymer that you facing

[Brewin]
Aiyyo, the bullseye pulls my leg and beggin for mercy
My verse be the Don King-in, come out swinging
I'll to kill it, apply my skill shit and the floor's coming
Who ain't feelin my joint, so what that mean your jaw's numbing?
Chill let me stop, gotta get my joint dislodged
And retire armies of niggas, with my dishonorable discharge
And get real, pulling from deep and you gots to play up?
You talk about, ""Respect mines,"" steady missin your layups
Hoes to foes, I start staring, wild truculant
Heart tearing style, fuck you then, order your demise
I'm well stocked, shell shocked, describin the bombs alarms
Incoming, when drum and vocal localize
For niggaz talkin bout Lucci, must be modeling Susan
Erika Kane bitch like, reputation for losing
Listen do you hear voices saying, ""Damn that's a sucker""
Paranoid, looking like Fuzzy Zoeller at the Rukas

[El-P]
Hey yo my nihilist, stylus, cuts matter the finest
The prime of the sequence hides my vicious defense assignment
Your cacophonic visuals bond strictly to bitch tissue fissure
Yeah, the burn from what I'm worth operation
I hate, let's exterminate bandwidths and communicate physically
Bezerk non happers will sleep on third rails for their cemetery
Enlist as, from small pox to syphillis, all stars
Shit on punchlines insidious kid, that you barf off
Only buck fifty you ever handed out was with a Metro card
I can fit the sum of your Tom Thumb concepts in a thimble
Simple bitches, Doctor Death lacing barbed wire stitches
A herd of mad cows bust through brick walls like Jumanji
Sixty-Five upsetter, malicious sickness scatalogics
Prophets turned skeptics, skeptics found Jesus
Right-Wingers turned leftist, everybody jumped on the dick of independence
Sorry we don't want you anymore get lost kid find an exit
Bugged, isn't it? Huh, live you fuckin suckers
I woulda been a witness to collapse your fame squadron
Pardon me, still a fan trying to understand how to be a master
For our Peoples who I see Dilated turn your fuckin grill to alabaster

I'm workin hard son certain to get the job done
Excuse me flirtin with stardom but not a groupie
My ratin droppin a doosie watchin a movie
Because what I'm spittin a lot (tipper) than (hawk tooie)
I spit fire all you mcs are tracking about it
Try and dis gimme a mic I turn cats to liars
haven't given a thumbs up get your thumbs up
This isn't kids stuff fuck getting your thumb sucked
This shits for grown folks don't approach
'cause I got it sewn while you players are sowin oats
Id rather bless em and make em turn christian
Better learn and listen or become one of my burn victims

[Kimani]
I be the energies of people before they say shit
To peep they fake appearance like Joan River's facelift
By my name of hieroglyphics you could say I'm prolific
I left something for lost ones who missed the space ship
All aboard these concepts beyond your vision
I got intergalactic the minute your block formed your opinion
Born and raised off the boulevard of lyndon
Where people do what they feel regardless if they're forgiven
We all livin the X Generation of children
and we all givin what we got to give on this mission
Till this world's ended and meets with a sudden collision
Yo we bring it back ten times more efficient

[Oracle]
Yo yo yo yo we rock harder than jams by Vincer Carter
Using art of war tactics smash kids that oughta know better
Than to test the clique we flow better
From the NYC givin more Fitz than Ella
Set it off now you want to brawl we rock why'all
Cut you in half then watch you fall like Darth Maul
All of these kids hatin against my one band
Soundin silly like Wesley Snipes needin a sun tan
I be the one man here sippin Guinness and beer
As the whole hemisphere sittin quakin in fear
don't near to this kid quickly you'll learn how shits flipped
I got the whole world tapin my joints like Linda Tripp

[El-P]
Decrepit as the sweaty inner ass cheeks of Dennis Franz (???)
Son of a dirty monkey the thug grabs abusive
Whore and a smack before I rock toothless
Ambesin, Lake and palm is bad medicine
With brakes for hands dance to the pain game
Worker ant rebel rebel work car radio reject the fat though
Sliced nice exacto
Its a sunny night for gash and lure the tact contract
Killer villain sick villain
Blankets for indians this here's for children
Fun for the internet just say no to cigarettes
You're soft as pikachu on roofies in a bathtub
I can see the inexeperience in your aura slash coding
The perpetrator math that you taught is eroding
Fuck it I'm bonin

[J-Live]
I keep honey in my archives to transform crowds into beehives
You best to be-lieve that J be Live
Arrive at this conclusion upon my introduction
from distance when the name rings bells you feel the suction
So in order to survive while going to J-Live
realize to speak wise by the way your lyrics (arrive)
Because in the obstruction of justice in my construction
Will lead to your abduction which leads to your destruction
For those that oppose the will or doubt the skill
I put you on the clock when I got time to kill
And seein as how there's never been a time better than now
Rewind rewards you wit a free refill

[Mr. Complex]
We're right here and right now how
This way straight the lyrical blaw
that blow you away to kingdom come
Singin um me me me I'm self-centered when I wore my cords
Oh my lord give me strength and stamina
for the extra length of the diameter
I'm aires and a (rameter)
The same way I was diagramming-a
I'm figure a You're figure be	
?? complex it was hard to figure me
I'm outspoken broken english hairline fracture words
I'm on some Hitchcock shit throw me along from the pack of birds
Feel the vultures they about to die soon feel the typhoon
Say hello to your high ass right here at high noon
There's a war between these underground and these commercial acts
Put us on the same stage and well just hurt these cats
we hurt em
we hurt em

But I've got to tell you how I feel
Open your eyes, don't try to hide my love
So hard to say but I think it's best
Gotta give your heart its time to heal
When you're ready, I'll be there

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

I'm serious when I tell you, Love
That little heartbreak
Is ten to a dime
Don't be afraid
Just turn the page my love
I'm curious when the day will come
I see my reflection in your eyes
Take your time and I'll be there

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to

Only love, only love

Looking through my eyes at the world
can't you see
Every time i see your face
There's a choice to be made

Walking hand in hand
Through the sands of time
As I peer into the past
Foreign steps are terrorizing

Watching what is now
There's a fork in the path
Of the future of your life
Which road shall you choose

Choices to be made
Past and present
It's not easy
But my love will let me die
Until your heart resurrects me

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to

Que soy tu delirio
Y que en ésta vida
He sido tu cruz

Ay! Amor ya no me quieras tanto
Ay! Amor no sufras más por mí
Si no más puedo causarte llanto
Ay! Amor olvídate de mí

Me da pena que sigas sufriendo
Este amor desesperado
Yo quisiera que tú encontras
De nuevo otro querer
Otro ser que te brinde la dicha
Que yo no te he brindado
Y que pueda alejarma de tí
Para nunca más volver

Ay! Amor ya no me quieras tanto
Ay! Amor no sufras más por mí
Si no más puedo causarte llanto
Ay! Amor olvídate de mí",No Me Quieras Tanto,1995

J. Allister Choir,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1988

Recuerda que te entregaron amor por un sincero 
Un amor en el que nunca creíste 
Perdiste la confianza sin motivos, sin razón 
Explicación nunca me pediste

This is the remix! 

Nena, te llegaron con un chisme increíble 
Y tú les creíste, claro que lo hiciste 
Cosas del pasado nos dejaron cicatrices

No confiaste en mí, después de lo que yo te dí 
Tú segaste tu mirada, creíste todo lo que hablaban 
Gané, tú inseguridad 
Terminaste en otra boca 
Te pido que algún día no pienses regresar 
 
Porque va a hacer muy tarde 
Y cuando te mires al espejo 
Y mires que todo fue un cuento

Nena, te llegaron con un chisme increíble

Cuanto lamento, que hayas creído un cuento 
Y justo en el momento que más te amaba
Ay cuanto siento, que vuelo como el viento 
Todo ese sentimiento, que yo te daba 

Ayer subiste una foto, no te ves feliz ni yo tampoco 
En el amor no se juega al teléfono roto 
Me dieron ganas de ponerte un comentario 
Pero paré al saber que

Tus amigas te prohibieron mencionar mi nombre 
Se meten en lo nuestro y no les corresponde 
Nadie tiene que opinar 
No escuchaste mi verdad 

Hoy te veo con él 
Y se me viene a la mente tu piel 
No pude explicarte como fueron las cosas 
Y salí perdiendo, quemé nuestro tiempo 
No hay nada que hacer

Y me tiras de nuevo,y yo sigo llamándote 
Parece que vivo engañándome 
Ya entiendo,que en el proceso 
No sanas las heridas, la mente no olvida 
Todas caídas,promesas incumplidas 
Pero sigo esperándote (yeah) 
A mi manera amándote 
Aveces tenemos que derrumbar,para reconstruirnos 
El pasado hay que borrarlo no se puede revivirlo 
Lo que sientas que tengas el mundo en tus 
Hombros,una flor puede renacer de los escombros 

Tu no puedes,seguir jugando con mi esperanza 
Hay algo peor que no tener nada 
Y el que alguien te deje en a nada 
Vas si hoy sin rumbo 

Esto que construimos,nadie lo va a arruinar 
Si tu y yo decidimos,por siempre perdurar 
Si el amor toco la puerta(mucho menos) 
Solo dale una respuesta

Pero como esa cabrona se comio la fruta 
Por eso es que hoy en dia hay mujeres tan putas

Se tiran de espalda y se les ven las nalgas 
Entonces dicen que uno es un bellaco y no respeta (seguro)

Tú y yo tenemos química 
Tanto así que en la cama me ves y me haces mímica 
Expresando lo que tú quieres 
Y tu cara me dice como lo prefiere 

Suavecito y despacio 
Lento, como un cohete en el espacio 
Voy ha agarrarme de tu pelo lacio 
Y voy a hacer de nuestra habitación un gimnasio 

Y voy a darte taller como tú necesitas 
Yo le llego si tú me solicitas 
Esta noche tenemos una cita 
Yo me voy contigo a tu casa si tú me invitas

J. Alvarez,"Los Vaqueros, luchando por esto que llamamos vida
Vivimos día a día con mucha gallardía
Y demostrando siempre la hombría
Ser un vaquero no es coger un arma y sentirte más que nadie
Un vaquero respeta para que lo respeten,
No importando el ni el tamaño ni el corillo con que se encuentre el otro
Un vaquero siempre mantendrá la cabeza en alto
Porque esta claro en su andar
Muchos por ahí vociferan que son vaqueros y que son esto y lo otro
Pero mira mejor aprenda de los que saben de esto
Déjese llevar por los que le dan consejos para bien
Y no de aquellos que ponen un arma en sus manos para que le tire a un hermano
No sea un monigote, demostremos la inteligencia de defender la razón
Recuerden que cuando la verdad llega, la mentira baja la cabeza
Hago un llamado a que se respete a la familia,
A que no se le esté tirando a esos carros,
Que las mujeres o niños van monta'o
A nadie le gustaría pasar por eso
Para ser un vaquero te hace falta corazón
Para decir las cosas tal cual y siempre cumplir con tu palabra
Y éste que les voy a presentar es el líder de los vaqueros
Wisin, te habla tu amigo Gavilan
Despertando conciencia en los vaqueros
Doble U que dejen la nebula
Que saben que les tenemos el ojo clavao

¡doble U! Okay, los vaqueros llegamos, ustedes toditos temblaron
Hablaron, roncaron pero nunca me pararon, cambiaron
Quisieron medir fuerzas conmigo y se estrellaron
Hice un llamado y los duros del género se reportaron
En verdad los don ustedes no aguantan mi presión
No me hables de dinero ni de proyección
Movimientos millonarios de nación a nación,
Los que conocen la operación los vaqueros de expedición
De inmediato, liricamente esto es un maltrato
Y estaba pa rato seguimos en el liderato,
Ustedes huelen a envidia me lo dice el olfato
Midiendo fuerzas pelagatos yo tengo los campeonatos

La marash
Del aeropuerto al concierto tengo todo self
Cierro todo allí luego regreso al jet
Prendo un blon en el aire que el piloto dice oh shit
Y al bajarme del avión me monté en un corvette
Ando fuera de control parezco una epidemia
Tengo tanto Flow que puedo abrir una academia
Y enseñarte a vestir y enseñarte a rapiar
Todo me queda bien aunque en verdad me quede mal
Cuidado con lo que hablan o vayan a hablar
Hasta a Pablo lo mataron, aquí nadie es inmortal (Escobar)
Los rifles del pana mío están locos por disparar
Y si te dan, no te salvan en el hospital
Prrrra
Causan heridas difícil de ver,
Profundo ni un sastre te puede coser
Mala mía es que ya los mató sin querer
Pero si no los mato como mi familia va a comer

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh)
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedoo

Seguimos frescos, sacados de la caja
El princi
El cerebro
El mueka, brrr
Saliendo pa fuera, Jordan en piel de pantera
Dicen Cosculluela a veces exagera
Intachable, nunca me han declarado culpable
Y bajar al nivel de ustedes ya no es negociable
Marica, los oyeron lo certifican
Diamantes en mi Rolex ya parecen canicas
Es inmenso el motor en el Ferrari menso
Tu no me vas a alcanzar en un Mercedes Benz
El piquete, el águila tras el billete
En sociedad con el tirao negro del doblete
Rapero estás escuchando el verdadero,
Cosculluela comandando Los Vaqueros

Ajustame el audífono que esto es pa los vaqueros
Si hay que romper el micrófono
Leyendo lo que escribo en la nota de mi telefono
Ya soy un icono, apuntandoles el rostro como blancos de polígonos
'Toy pensando que yo vengo en la fe del piloto
Lambe escroto de ese rostro te vo a sacar el poroto
Ay ma, que el lugar teniente cambien el sendero
La sociedad del dinero y yo matando en los vaqueros
Siente el rantantan fue que volvió el animal dale siguelo
Con los de Guayaquil te la vo a busca
Ya yo estoy aquí no me voy a salir
Quien me va a sacar si como yo no hay
Así que no lo intentes
Porque quedarás con daños permanentes

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo
Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Andan vociferando de que pistolean
Que me darán muerte donde yo me vea
Quisiera ver tu cara cuando me meta tu aldea
Y le limpie la cacharra al frente tuyo al más que mea
Dímelo Wisin llegaron los vaqueros del futurum
Fue casi de seguro brincaran como canguro
Pendejo operaciones millonarias decisiones
Un quimico fresco pa hacer temblar las naciones
Bajando al enemigo del caballo a lo Billy The Kid
Un solo fantasmeo y doble U no salen de aquí
Fuego pa ti te va a caer cuando me activar
Los vaqueros tienen calibre y rompen al que se la vive

Yo los he visto como ladran, como se crecen en un par de meses
Pero cuando explota el peo, se desaparecen
Vociferan que son líder, roncan que son los killer
Se meten un par de pepas y los pasos no los miden
El miedo les falla el pulso, hacer calle ya no hay pulso
Vaqueros tamo aquí so que controlen los impulsos
Y los requisitos son hay que tener cojones,
No hablar mierda en las canciones, 'tar ready pa las misiones
Y se monta too el mundo, se respeta al que respete
Yo estoy en la calle desde que pito tenia grillete
Yo te la traigo como eco eco seo pa que llegue
Si no te mando a los dementes pa que de una te frenen
Dile Wisin que yo si que soy real,
Que yo no fantasmeo, que yo si soy un anormal
En moto seca a trabajar, los bajo el palo sin hablar
Dile jordán el significado de ser leal (Se reporta el menor)

Enmascarao como el Zorro, ando solo soy el Horrellender
Los enemigos me ven, se las ponen y gritan danger
Blindao de negro completo, abran paso llegó Darth Vader,
Batman siempre fue el mejor por eso nunca fue un Avenger
Vaqueros llegó pancho villa, me encanta el protagonismo
De que van a roncarme a mi cabrones de lo mismo
Ya yo estoy acá arriba sigue subiendo la cuenta
De aquí yo los espero con Las toro bajo cuentas
Me dicen Kevin Durant el 35 de los thunder
Por que sin mi la giny sin coger ni un solo conver
Esto no es Toy Story buddy agarrate el sombrero
Que el menor no está jugando, preguntale a los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

¡pusho!
Hoy cambiamos la history no tuve que engancharme en la fory,
Porque ando con 10 vaqueros y no son los de toy story
Reverencia tranquilo, abranle paso al pupilo
Que en estilo me lo tasaron este un millón de kilos
Tanto file, las tarjetas negras no me da decline
Yo nunca pierdo aunque me vaya Cinco veces over time
Tamos a lo fucker llenando hasta los estadios de soccer
El acto principal muchachos, volvió Paul Walker
Doble U me dijo que rompa
Que yo soy la A porque se come alas compás
Matando a estos rajeros que se meten en todos los agujeros
Soy el único novato rompiendo en los vaqueros

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa su entierro que andamos a fuego
Y somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego aquí no hay miedo

Tumbe esa cara de misterio,
Hagan planes pa su entierro que andamos a fuego

Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

Yo, she don't want war, we all want more
More hardcore drinks before I'm on tour
Got the kush in the cones, you know I stuff Raw
For an encore, big balling wherever I ball
I'ma keep bragging 'bout how I got here
20 year career it's always sincere
These dudes are just one hit wonders
You don't know who I am? Go ask your mothers
You got OG's, you ask your brothers
They will tell you what I did to these summers
And they gon' tell you that N.O.R.E. came to play to win

Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, lady
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

I peep what you're goin' through, baby
You don't know, but it is in your eyes
I think you need a 180
The total opposite'll be nice

Come have a drink with me, baby
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, lady
Singin' all night, all night 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby, oh

Otro trago mas, y enciende
Otro trago mas, otro trago mas
Que viva mi gente

Baby conmigo pásala bien
Sabes que te voy a tratar a cien
Hagamos travesuras
Sin perce, que locura
No se ven
Soy el crema en el caldero y el sartén
Barbie yo soy ken
Fuego pa’ la hoja, te toco y te moja’
Llegamos y el lugar se desaloja
Te doy hasta que termine, escoja baby

Si no es Ferragamo es Valentino
Mami somos gangster pero finos
La mesa con DJ y botellas
Y de camino tomate otro Red Bull si mañana
Nos morimos
Da te otro trago (Uno mas)
Y vamos a viajar sin que lo notes (Uno mas)
Y que tus labios
Quiero que pidas que yo te controle (Uno mas)

Y aunque no me creas, siento lo mismo por ti
No sabes cuanto yo te sigo amando
Extraño tus peleas, quisiera oírte reír
Pero por cosas de la vida dices que ahora te perdí por siempre
Cupido se olvido de mi suerte
Y ahora mis ojos no ven si tu no estas

Dime porque, como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas
Pero el sol no sale si tu no estas
Si tu no estas, que puedo hacer?
Como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas
Pero el sol no sale si tu no estas, no no no

Ok, ok, ok
Yo tengo toa's tus fotos y todas las he roto
Pero las guardo en una cajita, no las boto
Para por si quiero verte las busco y después las pego
Es en un rompecabezas sin el juego
Ya nunca me divierto, no tengo quien se ria de mis cuentos
Ni quien escuche to' mis embelezcos
Espero que no te demores, te busques un gato y que te enamore
Y yo siga aquí tomando pastilla de to's colores
Rotwailla!

Y a veces cuando pienso en ti, baby la cabeza me da vueltas
No quiero ni pensar, yo no se ni como actuar y si supiera
Que yo vivo pensando en ti, baby aunque a veces no lo sientas
No puedo mostrar, que vida me tienes mal

Si tu no estas, dime porque
Como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas

Si tu no estas, que puedo hacer?
Como yo le hago pa' volverte a ver
Llevo tanto tiempo y siento que te vas
Pero el sol no sale si tu no estas, no no no

Yo te he mandao' un par de fotos mías de los shows
Y un par de cartas, no se si apunte bien el zip-code
Porque yo manda que te manda y no recibo ni un recibo
No se si tu sabes que yo estoy vivo
O piensas que yo estoy muerto, me estoy volviendo loco como berto
En el amor nunca he sido un experto
Tuve que ir al hospital, doctor receteme algo, yo estoy mal
Llevo noches y noches despierto, lo que hago es pensar bebe

No quiero ni pensar, yo no se ni como actuar y si supiera

Que grite como tu quiera reggaeton que te quema

¡Dale movimiento, dale dembow
Menéalo rápido, ponlo en slow
Se pone dulzona cuando lo baila con flow
Rompe todas las ondas y roba el show
Cuando se combina un parcero con la maña de 'boriquizi' 
Hay mucho piquete pa la nena, estamos 'easy' 
Alguien va a pararnos, whoa whoa, difícil
Ninguna se salva cuando cae el 'missile' 

Que le den, que le den, que le den reggaeton  pa' ver lo que pasa
Que le den, que le den, que le den prueba la fiera y te caza
zumba y arrasa, me prende y pasa 
Yo lo tumbo y exploto la casa

¡Y dale movimiento dale dembow
Menéalo rápido, ponlo en slow

¿Por qué tú eres así? 
Loquito me tienes a mí 
Los ojos me quieren salir 
Si todo me gusta de ti

Ya ni como ni duermo 
Desde el día que yo vi tu cuerpo 
Aquí me tiene como un enfermo 
Nuevamente te tengo, 
Me acerco y aprovecho el momento
Y te digo al oído bien lento

Sexy baila, y me deja con las ganas 

Y yo hoy estoy aquí sediento y loco por tenerte 
Tu boca me llama, me pide que te bese
Tú eres la única que me hace morir de ganas
Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (farru)

Déjate llevar por el boom boom 
Del bajo cuando azota 
Pégate a mi cuerpo
No te hagas la loca y baila 
Tú no eres una santa
Como te gusta el dembow
Y el reggaeton te encanta 

Hay química entre tú y yo 
No miremos bebe el reloj
Si tomas este servidor te invita
Ya yo se lo que tú necesitas

Que bien te queda a ti esa faldita
Ella es señora no es señorita
Sexy baila y me deja con las ganas
Como te luces cuando lo meneas
Cuanto quisiera hacerte el amor
Enséñame lo que sabes

Que la noche no se va a acabar temprano
Siénteme y dame de ese calor humano
Anda con Yandel no con cualquier fulano
Lleguemos mas allá
Más allá de la ropa
Más allá de besarte en la boca 
Más allá de darnos un par de copas 
Tú haces que me eleve la nota 
En la cama me agotas 
Cuando te mueves así, bailando 
Sigue rozándome así, guayando 
Como te brilla la piel sudando 
Sigue sigue me estás descontrolando

Que la noche es pasajera

Me encanta cuando me baila de espalda
Me dice un secreto y se sube la falda
Hay algo en su mirada, no sé lo que será
Me lleva a delirar y yo no sé qué pasará

La luna me detecta, suave, que me afectas
Esperando el momento, esta es la noche perfecta
De ti estoy sediento, sabes que no te miento
Mis pulsaciones suben entre más cerca te siento

Bajo la luna llena 
Olvidémonos de las penas
Quémame con tu cuerpo, nena
Que la noche es pasajera
Bajo la luna llena 
Olvidémonos de las penas
Quémame con tu cuerpo, nena
Que la noche es pasajera

Hazme el amor como si me odiaras
Y bésame como si me extrañaras
Tan sólo deja tu huella en mi cama 
Y que las sábanas ardan en llamas

Es que me altero cuando yo te veo
No podemos ocultar el deseo
Tener tu cuerpo es lo que yo quiero

Bajo la luna llena 
Olvidémonos de las penas
Quémame con tu cuerpo, nena
Que la noche es pasajera
Bajo la luna llena 
olvidémonos de las penas
Quémame con tu cuerpo, nena
Que la noche es pasajera

J. Balvin,"La noche es larga y pa’ conocernos 
Tenemos tiempo tú y yo
Baby, suéltate, no pierdas tiempo
Vive el momento entre los dos
Pero no me preguntes pa’ donde voy 
Porque no soy tu boyfriend
Que lo que yo quiero es una noche

Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme
Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme

Detrás de tus lentes oscuros yo estoy casi seguro 
Que tus ojos a mí me están señalando
Dejemos el disimulo, que yo contigo me curo
Yo no sé lo que tú tanto estás esperando

Pero tu cuerpo me llama y yo veo que le contesto 
To´ está fuera de concurso, to´ está fuera de contexto
Aquí estamos los vengadores DJ Urba junto a Rome
Somos los campeones de eso no hay duda, señores

Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme
Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme

Yo sé que te gusta mi swag
Comó yo te llevo a volar
Sé que te gusta sentirnos vivos
Que lo hagamos agresivo 
Y que sea prohibido, mamá
Yo sé que te gusta mi swag
Comó yo te llevo a volar
Sé que te gusta sentirnos vivos
Que lo hagamos agresivo 
Y que sea prohibido, mamá

Ella quiere que yo la lleve, que conmigo ella se eleve
Cuando ella me mira de reojo, porque sabe que yo me antojo
Qué bonito le queda el rojo, qué pasaría si me la robo
Demasiado sensual, sacándole el instinto al lobo

Es esto soy una maquina, tú eres la que me domina
Se ve que le estás metiendo fuerte a tu zona abdominal
Tenemos cuenta pendiente, se mueve como una serpiente
Y ahora quiere que le apague su instinto caliente

Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme
Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme",Déjate Llevar,2013

Permítame estar a solas contigo má
Y tú veras

Permítame, oh, oh
Desnúdate, hagamos lo prohibido má

Sí señor, pues nos vamos
Baby, los papeles no chequeamos
Y no hagas la maleta ya compramos
Ni siquiera sé el destino 
Pero de seguro será bien fino
En gastos, baby, tú sabes, no mido

Qué recuerdos prohibidos 
Que me hacen sentir demasiado vivo
Viajar sin gastar yo no lo consigo, 
Pues vamos a parís por tu fragancia
Yo soy tu kanye west
Y tú serás mi kim kardashian

Y esta noche es pa´ los dos
Ya no dudes, mami, ven y vete conmigo
Sé que a ti te encanta cómo te hago el amor
Solamente quiero amarte
Si también me dejas voy a acariciarte
Calor y pasamos el rato, mamá
Y esta noche es pa´ los dos

Desnúdate, hagamos lo prohibido má
Y hagamos lo prohibido má

Permíteme hablar con el que de ti esté a cargo
Así sean tus padres con mi actitud los desarmo
Si quieres los llevamos, pero se van a otro barco
Hoy inventa excusas, que tiene vuelta de banco

Y esta noche es pa´ los dos
Ya no dudes, mami, ven y vete conmigo

Quisiera ver lentamente 
Cómo tu cuerpo tocas

Hace calor y ya te estoy imaginando, girl
De pensarte me lleva a la locura
Y sólo de tenerte cerca 
Eleva mi temperatura

Estoy imaginándome 
Cómo tu piel está rozándome
Tu cuerpo y el mío calentándose
Quisiera saber lo que imagina usted
Estoy imaginándome

Hablarte al oído, escucha mi voz
Sólo somos tú y yo

Tú sabes muy bien que mi cama te está esperando
No sabes hace cuánto yo te estoy deseando
Apaga la luz, deja esa actitud
Déjate llevar que yo sé lo que quieres tú
