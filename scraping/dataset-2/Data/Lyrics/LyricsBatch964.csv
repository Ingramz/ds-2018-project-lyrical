Russ Freeman,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in you arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name or someone's laugh
That is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store, should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring, but I should
Never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two",I Get Along Without You Very Well,2004
Russ Freeman,"Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so",Moonlight Becomes You,2004
Russ Freeman,"My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine 
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art 
 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak
Are you smiling? 
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay 
Each day is Valentine's Day",My Funny Valentine,2004
Russ Freeman,"The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone
I can see it in your eyes
I can hear it in your sighs
Feel your touch and realize
The thrill is gone

The nights are cold
For love is old
Love was grand when love was new
Birds were singing, skies were blue
Now it don't appeal to you
The thrill is gone

This is the end
So why pretend
And let it linger on
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone",The Thrill Is Gone [Alternate Take][*],2004
Russ Freeman,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
(Him, with her humming along)
That all I longed for long ago

Was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),2005
Russ Freeman,"The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The party's over, the candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon

It's all over, my friend",The Party's Over,2005
Russ Freeman,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me

There is nothing more I can say",Sweet and Lovely,2005
Russ Freeman,"I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard 
For love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love so easily 
I fall in love too fast
 
My heart should be well schooled

Russ Freeman,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me
",Imagination,2006
Russ Freeman,"Somewhere, someday
Well be close together, wait and see
Oh by the way,
This time the dreams on me

You take my hand
And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me",This Time the Deam's on Me,2006
Russ Freeman,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2006
Russ Freeman,"Whenever it's early twilight
I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you",It's Always You,2012
Russ Freeman,"Nights are long since you went away
I think about you all through the day
My buddy, my buddy, no buddy quite so true
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you

Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you",My Buddy,2012
Russ Freeman,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart",Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart,2012
Russ Freeman,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Russ Freeman,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Russ Freeman,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Feeling like someone in love

Russ Freeman,"For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into

Russ Freeman,"Nobody on the road,
Nobody on the beach.
I feel it in the air,
The summer's out of reach.
Empty lake, empty streets,
The sun goes down alone.
I'm driving by your house
Don't know you're not home.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy,
Remember how I made you scream.
I don't understand what happened to our love.
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

I can see you,

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.
A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was.
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever.
I should just let 'em go, but

And that radio on, baby.

And I knew the spark of love was still burning

Russ Garcia & His Orchestra,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere

Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesi

A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesi

She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?

And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesi?",Frenesi,1958

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

She's in love with a hustla
She only messing with them suckas
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on
And I know that she be feeling me

[Baby Beesh]
She in love with a hustla, someone she could trust uh
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas
Sleep all day, and grind all night
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

[Baby Beesh]
Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka romance
Love to see me get the lapdance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, but she don't give a damn

Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
And I trust you mom 
But the doesn't mean my lust for fun, want to bust my gun 
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
To the treasure up the post 
You just never fucking know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance 
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass 

I be sayin' though, livin' my life, wishin' and hopin'
I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

I be sayin though taken away from the frustration 
I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination 
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry

Russ Lee,"Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to everyone out there
Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen

Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her

So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah

I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same

Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls

These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words

Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us

I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites

And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone

She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself

She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love
Or at least I thought it was love, yeah

Ooh, on and on
She wasn't good at all
She wasn't good at all, yeah, yeah
I said I'm glad she's out of my life

I'm going crazy, crazy for you
And have you ever loved somebody that would give it all for you
I'm going crazy, crazy for you

I've always been by myself 
Lived life by myself
Never cared for solitude
Just cared for the wealth
Steady stackin'
Never slackin'
With no time to be wastin'

I was chasin' their paper
But then (but then) came you (came you)

And I ain't felt this way in a minute
And I ain't gonna lie to you ma

And every day you make it clear that you don't want to be replaced
Just by them little things you do, just by them little things you say

I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more

I keep hearing you laughin', screamin', callin' my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

Is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind

In the ghetto, I'm living in a ghetto world
In the ghetto (in the ghetto), it's a struggle but I gotta maintain

[Trae]
Welcome to the ghetto, where forever be the same
Hard times, got my people unable to maintain
Everytime I look around, it's somebody doing bad
That'll put you in the grave, for som'ing they never had

Everyday in the hood, it be the same thang
Poverty running my people, so they love pain
And I don't know if it's wrong, but still I know it ain't right
I seen a lot of people die, in the street life

The other day it hit my heart, when I watch the news
A lil' girl got killed, while she was 'sleep in her room
And she ain't deserve to die, cause that's a kid dog
Them niggaz took the life, that she ain't get to live at all

Sometimes I want to help the ghetto, but it ain't gon do a thang
'Cause I know that they ignant, and that's a god damn shame
It's an everyday task, trying to live a good life
Inside of the ghetto, where everybody be shife

[Yung Redd]
Welcome to the South, niggaz ain't sleep at all
Everybody out on the block, stay ducking them laws
A couple niggaz on parole, hustling by the sto'
I'm telling that ain't the way to go, play your role

But you don't hear me though, this what I'm living fo'
Hustle till I get mine, grind cause I need mo'
Shots release, too late for you to scream peace
This how it is in the street, leaving is obsolete

And still I maintain, seeing the same thang
Sometime I scream, my brain just looking for a change
But day in and day out, I move in and move out
Keep my bidness discrete, I'm on a paper route

I wasn't broke for nothing, still I was learning some'ing
If you ain't been through nothing, then you ain't seen nothing
This how it really is, around my way
Where anybody can get it, anytime of the day

[Lil Boss]
I analyze the block, babies are running round with glocks
Dope in they socks, can't skip hot so fuck the cops
Moving from crumbs to bricks, nigga these slums are thick
I try to tell my lil' niggaz, but they think they slick

These white folks don't play, they gon hot your way
They try to give you twenty years, just for living the wrong way
And who's to say now-a-day, right from wrong
They ain't living how we live, so they can't get in my zone

We get chased home for stones, and laws want to break our bones
In places in and out a high cell, to roam
And that's prolly the reason, we going crazy
Pissed at poverty, cause the system trying to fade me

Lately, I've been trying to stay out of trouble
But it's hard to stop from copping, the sack and flipping the double
Don't catch the wrong route, when you on that Metro
There's a sign in front of the hood, that says Welcome To the Ghetto

[Hook: x 2]

[Spice 1]
I wonder, if heaven got a ghetto
But be	-burning down the be	-block, I put the petal to the medal
Running with my cousins in Texas, Lil' Cross and Big Money
My nigga Trae and Lil' Joe, nigga all action

In the ghetto, I've been riding through the hood for years
And ain't a damn thang changed, mama still shedding tears
Niggaz fresh out the Penn, some niggaz just going in
Some niggaz gon run and stutter, turning they self in

Never seen a black man, flying dope on a plane
But they lock us up for it, shackle us with chains
Welcome to the ghetto, ghetto starts and mob cars
With bullet holes in it, niggaz shot up and scarred

But still living, driven by the game itself
To stay alive in these cold streets, mashing for wealth
Up in this ghetto, O.G.'s P's and see's
Thugs, pimps, playas hit the 6-4's or 3's

I'm a spit some of this real game
Some real shit, some real talk
Na, na, whoa, oh, whoa

Ugh, check my watch, check my chain
It's simple and plain, the Chevy wit the blew out brains
As I bounce and mash, count this cash
Floss and flash, cop and blow a zip wit Bash

Since everything is big in Texas then where's the zag's?
I'm across the finish line, tell me where's the flags?
Brought my rag top, should have brought the Jag
On the beach me and Beesh, look at all this ass

I could tell you stories but can show you cash
Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass
To the next playa hater and he'll break like glass
Now I got a bunch of people digging' through my pads

So I choose to floss 'cause who's the boss, let's ink it
It's Richie Rich for those who thought re-think it
Some yell it and tell it, I blow it and smoke it and smell it
Let's spend tokens wit my people who sell it, what?

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
But it's really nothin' though
But it's really nothin' though

I could show you somethin' dirty deep up in them corners mayne
What's the deal?
I could bend the block and make it hotter than a Forman grill
I got the keys to the Chevy Caprice
I could show you mother fuckin' snitches straight to Belize

Now that's low, fa sho', conspiracy and parole
I could show you real cats doin' time over a ho
I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design

I could show you streetlights and heart beak hotels
I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo
Down to do what I gotta do to satisfy the man in me
And from the looks of thangs the popo's ain't understandin' me

The original digital scale reader
The pedigree playa who be stackin' his Velveeta
I could show you boss stuntin' so fuckin' disgustin'
I could show you rapper's frontin' but mayne it's really nothin'

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
But it's really nothin' though
But it's really nothin' though

I could show you, I could reach you and teach you
I know you and where you comin' from, I understand it
This been goin' on forever dog, it's no end
Life is like a bullet in your back from a close friend

Disappointed to the point where I'm runnin' by myself
Never knowin' where I'm goin' start to wonder myself, yeah
Money was a necessity, my greed got the best of me
You think you smokin' Uncle be, who got the recipe?

I'm sayin' it's nothin', I say it sincerely, and speakin' clearly
I'd rather you respect me than fear me
I came a long way and still I got a while to go
You probably thinkin' to yourself, ""What's he smilin' for?""

My dog Bash about to be platinum doin' his thang
So if you hate him for it, boy you fakin' and know it
We takin' this money, big bundles of bills
I'm like a whole 'nother person when it come to this skrill

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me
I'm the Twista, I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy
Damn skippy, gamin' it from a shot of Mississippi, now pimp on

Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2001
Russ Peterson,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,2001
Russ Peterson,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,

When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

Russ Phillips,"I touch your lips and all at once the sparks go flying
Those devil lips that know so well the art of lying
And though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher
I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

For forty days
With only a spark
To light my way

And through the grief

Through the lies
And through the storms
Through the cries
And through the wars

Out at sea
I'm hoping these waves
Don't cover me

I'm turned and tossed
Upon the waves
When the darkness comes
I feel the grave

But I still believe

Through the cold
And through the heat

Through the rain
And through the tears
Through the crowds
And through the cheers

I still believe
You can't take that away from me, no

I'll march this road
And I'll climb this hill
Upon my knees
If I have to

I'll take my place
Upon this stage
I'll wait till the end of time

You can't take that away from me

",I Still Believe,1994
Russ Taff,"When you're up against a struggle, that shatters all your dreams
And your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes
And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fear
Don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear

Praise the Lord, He will work through those who praise Him
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you
Serve only to remind you, that they drop powerless behind you
When you praise Him

Now, Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think
That we are paupers, when he knows himself we're children of the King
So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won
We know that Jesus Christ has risen and the work's already done

Praise the Lord, He will work through those who praise Him
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you
Serve only to remind you, that they drop powerless behind you
When you praise Him

Praise the Lord, He will work through those who praise Him

Away from the lights of the city
Where an old time preacher pitched a ragged old tent
Looked like it was a hundred years old

He started out preaching to no one
But pretty soon a crowd started gathering
And he preached the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

I turned into a wild man
Some people said I'd gone crazy
But all too soon came the harvest
Of the wild seeds that I had sown

Well, I stumbled into that meeting
I was looking like death warmed over
But then I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope road

When they sing come ye sinners, lost and hopeless
Lord I was hopeless heaven knows
Something got a hold of me, something got a hold hallelujah
When I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

It's still a wide spot out in the country
Away from the lights of the city
I pitched that old tent he gave me
The day that he died and went home

Some times I start preaching to no one
But pretty soon a crowd starts gathering
And I now preach the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

And we sing come ye sinners, lost and hopeless
Lord I was hopeless heaven knows
Something got a hold of me, something got a hold hallelujah
When I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear

Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgement morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away.",Hallelujah,

I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away

Standing there with broken wings

Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

We see each other plain
'm'sieur le mayor,'
You'll wear a different chain

Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me! there is something I must do
This woman leaves behind a suffering child
There is none, but me who can intercede
In mercy's name, three days are all I need
Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll return

You must think me mad
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man such as you.

Believe of me what you will (men like you can never change)
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do (men like me can never change)
You know nothing of my life (no, 24601)
All I did was steal some bread (my duty's to the law)
You know nothing of the world (you have no rights)
You would sooner see me dead (come with me 24601)
But not before I see this justice done (now the wheel has turned around Jean Valjean is nothing now)
I am warning you Javert (dare you talk to me of crime)
I'm a stronger man by far (I'm the price you had to pay)
There is power in me yet (every man is born in sin)
My race is not yet run (every man must choose his way)

Russell Crowe,"Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he
To have me caught in a trap
And choose to let me go free?
It was his hour at last
To put a seal on my fate
Wipe out the past
And wash me clean off the slate!
All it would take
Was a flick of his knife.
Vengeance was his
And he gave me back my life!

Damned if I'll live in the debt of a thief!
Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase.
I am the law and the law is not mocked
I'll spit his pity right back in his face
There is nothing on earth that we share
It is either Valjean or Javert!

And my thoughts fly apart
Can this man be believed?
Shall his sins be forgiven?
Shall his crimes be reprieved?

And must I now begin to doubt,
Who never doubted all these years?
My heart is stone and still it trembles
The world I have known is lost in shadow.
Is he from heaven or from hell?
And does he know
That granting me my life today
This man has killed me even so?

I am reaching, but I fall
And the stars are black and cold
As I stare into the void
Of a world that cannot hold
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean.

No

My sister's child was close to death
We were starving.

You will starve again

A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield

Shall have their reward

And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame!

And so it must be, and so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price!

That I may see him
Safe behind bars

Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails. 
Because I'm invited to step out this evening 
With top hat and white tie and tails. 

I'm putting on my top hat, 
Tying up my white tie, 
Brushing off my tails.

Putting in the shirt studs, 
Polishing my nails, 
I'm stepping out, my dear, 
To breathe an atmosphere 
That simply reeks with class; 
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust 
When I step on the gas, 
For I'll be there, 
Putting down my top hat, 
Mussing up my white tie, 
Dancing in my tails.","Top Hat, White Tie and Tails",1995

And misery was all I knew
Trying so to keep my love from showing
All the while not knowing you loved me too

Yes, loved me in lonesome silence
Your heart filled with dark despair
Thinking love would flame in you forever
And I'd never, never know the flame was there

Then one day we cast away our secret longing
The raging tide we held inside would hold no more
The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken

And now there's twice as much grief
Twice the strain for us
Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us
As we had known before

The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Every joyous word of love was spoken
And after all had been said here we are, my love
Silent once more and not far, my love
From where we were before

Russell Garcia & His Orchestra,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"".

You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali.

You're Keats, 
You're Shelly!

You're a Berlin ballad.

On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I said how you've been though you still look the same
Now my heart pounds through like nothing has changed
And there were so many lonely nights
Round and round like a lost soul it just wasn't right

Seeing you when it's heaven tonight
Makes the hurting subside, glad you doing alright
I'm fine too, though it struggles sometimes
Try to figure reasons to why you walked away from love
Good to see you again

So I take your hands to get lost in your eyes
The blood runs from my head really no big surprise
Cos my greatest times was the time spend with you
When I make love I still think of you
When you walked away from me you kept walking
I was too damn blind to see, now there's no more
talking

Seeing you when it's heaven tonight
Makes the hurting subside, glad you doing alright
I'm fine too, though it struggles sometimes
Try to figure reasons to why you walked away from love
Good to see you again

Seeing you when it's heaven tonight
Makes the hurting subside, glad you doing alright
I'm fine too, though it struggles sometimes
Try to figure reasons to why you walked away from love

Oh oh wa. I know you have to go
But one more night can't make this goodbye
I'm all alone

Russell Hitchcock,"I'm in a light bulb hotel here in Austin
Outside I hear the cold Kentucky rain
It's been a long and lonely from where I've starter
Just to see the mockyside misspell my name
Tonight I play for empty chairs and people
But back home my love she says prayer for me
And to belong she sleeps in like Ranger
Between me and her is all but Tennessee

But she loves me like I'm Elvis
She treats me like I just might be the king
She won't mad if I'm never famous
She'll stay up all night just to hear me sing
We may not ever have a mansion in Memphis
But she loves me like I'm Elvis

The owner never pay me what he promise
The only autograph I sing was my bar tab
Last week van broke down outside of Austin
To get it run it cost me every dime I had

But she loves me like I'm Elvis
She treats me like I just might be the king
She won't mad if I'm never famous
She'll stay up all night just to hear me sing
We may not ever have a mansion in Memphis
But she loves me like I'm Elvis

But I may never brace the gates of Graceland
Make the upper stage of the silver screen
But as long as I've got her by my side
I've got everything that I'll ever need

But she loves me like I'm Elvis
She treats me like I just might be the king

Always stressing me out, but still bring the best in me out
I'm knowing little mama down when a little drama spin
I'm a big timer trying to flip thangs in the city
Streets got you racking ? foot playas on your pretty feets
Pretty face laced up, tight from the waist up
Thick from the waist down, that's why I chased her
Everyday I wake up, nothing could stop me
I'm cocky, kissing me smelling like it's a mi atay
I'm a thug on the block with my whodis
Spending two g's when we shop at the Foley's
When the beef pop, she be looking at Max funny
But she won't trip, cause she love spending Max money
If I shot a ten, she'll bring a twenty back for me
If she really love me hit the cut push it back for me
Ride or die, and here you go hide the gat for me
And I can't wait to be alone so you could act for me, what act funny

I know you wish you could run away from this institution

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance

I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry

Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen

Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her

So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah

I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same

Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls

These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words

Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us

I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites

And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone

She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself

She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love

I could show you mother fuckin' snitches straight to Belize

Now that's low, fa sho', conspiracy and parole
I could show you real cats doin' time over a ho
I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design

I could show you streetlights and heart beak hotels
I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo
Down to do what I gotta do to satisfy the man in me
And from the looks of thangs the popo's ain't understandin' me

The original digital scale reader
The pedigree playa who be stackin' his Velveeta
I could show you boss stuntin' so fuckin' disgustin'
I could show you rapper's frontin' but mayne it's really nothin'

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya
But it's really nothin' though

I could show you, I could reach you and teach you
I know you and where you comin' from, I understand it
This been goin' on forever dog, it's no end
Life is like a bullet in your back from a close friend

Disappointed to the point where I'm runnin' by myself
Never knowin' where I'm goin' start to wonder myself, yeah
Money was a necessity, my greed got the best of me
You think you smokin' Uncle be, who got the recipe?

I'm sayin' it's nothin', I say it sincerely, and speakin' clearly
I'd rather you respect me than fear me
I came a long way and still I got a while to go
You probably thinkin' to yourself, ""What's he smilin' for?""

My dog Bash about to be platinum doin' his thang
So if you hate him for it, boy you fakin' and know it
We takin' this money, big bundles of bills
I'm like a whole 'nother person when it come to this skrill

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya

Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time

Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me

Russell Malone,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain

Soothing and slow

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Russell Malone,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too",Lush Life,2007

So pass the shit that'll knock me out

Glad I'm back, I'd disappear (x2)

Whatchu' cookin' something different
Showin' them the shit I get is damn
Lose my train of thought

Russell Moore,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2013

Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say

E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia d'un elica

Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte ma quando
Vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte

Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assai ecc

Poi penso alla lirica, e al grande palco
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro ma due occhi
Che ti guardano, cosi vicini e veri

Ti fan scordare le parole
O in fondo I tuoi pensieri
Cosi diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti la in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita

Come la scia d'un elica
Ma si, e la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensava tanto
Anzi, si sentiva gia felice
E ricomincio il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai, ecc

Miserere, miserere,
Miserere, misero me,
Pero brindo alla vita!

Ma che mistero, e la mia vita,
Che mistero!
Sono un peccatore dell'anno ottantamila,
Un menzognero!
Ma dove sono e cosa faccio,
Come vivo?
Vivo nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo!

Io sono il santo che ti ha tradito
Quando eri solo
E vivo altrove e osservo il mondo
Dal cielo,
E vedo il mare e le foreste,
Vedo me che...
Vido nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo!

Se see'e una notte buia abbastanza
Da nascondermi, nascondermi,
Se see'e una luce, una speranza,
Sole maginifico che splendi dentro me
Dammi la gioia di vivere
Che anchora non see'e!

Che forse ancora non see'e.

Que yo te vengo a dar.

En tardes de toros,
Mujer que conserva el embrujo
De los ojos moros.
De sueno, rebelde, gitana
Cubierta de flores,
Why beso tu boca de grana,
Jugosa manzana
Que me habla de amores.

En coplas preciosas,
No tengo otra cosa que darte
Que un ramo de roas,
De rosas de suave fragrancia
Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena.

That I've come to offer you.

From the bullfighting afternoons,
Woman who retains the spell
Of Moorish eyes.
A dream-land, a rebel, a gypsy,
Covered with flowers,
And I kiss your scarlet mouth,
Juicy apple
That tells me about love affairs.

In precious coplas,
I have nothing else to give you
But a bouquet of roses
Worthy of adorning the brown-skinned Virgin.
Granada, your soil is full
Of beautiful woman, blood and sunshine.

We only sacrifice the future it's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes you sometimes see as fate

And yet still you're here for me

Places we have been
Sunsets we will see
Over seas and across the lands
I know that you'll be there for me

As the sun goes down and the times roll on
I know you'll still be there for me

Though there are nights so cold
I know your love, it grows and our hearts
Will never die, two souls entwined as one
Like an endless galaxy

Like the stars that shine
In a moonlit sky

As I gaze at thee

I know you'll still be there for me

I want to fly and make it all alone

But my theatre is empty and this crowd is silent

And yet you know so well I haven't forgotten you
Because till yesterday you were music to me
And that's why, never pretending,
I asked myself: “who am I singing for now?”

Till my last breath
My voice and my soul are everything I have

I don't want to waste my desperation
Don't want to hit rock bottom and write a song

Are hand in hand once again
In this crowded theatre
I've found myself again
I've found myself

Love and music…

In the choir I'll be like two hearts beating as one
As your song will be my pride
And our charm
Headlights on towards the darkness,
Like tender lovers
Wet eyes in the audience
And us, lost in the crowd
Love and music are still hand in hand
If in my crowded theatre
I've found you again….Found you again

Russell Watson,"Me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We meet every day at the same cafe
Six-thirty, I know she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations, and so do I
Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones

Well, it's time for us to be leaving
And it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
And now she'll go her way, I'll go mine
But tomorrow we'll meet at the same place, the same time

The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see

I'll never forget the people I met
Braving those angry skies
I remember well as the shadows fell
The light of hope in their eyes

And though I'm far away
I still can hear them say
Bombs up...
But when the dawn comes up

there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see

there'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow

The valley will bloom again
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again

Russell Watson,"Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on like a fairy tale come true
Sittin' by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed 
I would find someone and baby I found you

[Chorus:]
And all I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift

Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment if all of time stood still
But the colors fade away
And the years will make us gray
But baby in my eyes you'll still be beautiful

Thank you for the gift",The Gift,2017

When troubles come and my heart burdened be

Each restless heart beats so imperfectly
But when you come and I am filled with wonder

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.

I saw the news today

The world seemed to stop

Fear was everywhere

And hope was so lost

In the circus of darkness

May I reply

I see him coming in the sky

Yes, I do

I see him coming in the sky

Watching and praying

And waiting all the day

With all it's abilities

It walks away

God speed that moment when I can stand and cry

I see Him coming in the sky

I see Him coming in the sky

I see Him coming

I see Him coming

Splitting the heavens in the twinkling of an eye

I see Him coming

See your misery.

Into this open flame but now those days are gone,

Is everything I ever thought it would be,
As the puppets in my head have turned into hoods,
Well please bring the rain, bring the rain, rain

Hold me touch me baby as I thank you, you

& there's a pulpit in my head that's turned
Into a garden waiting for her lonely cry, cry

Cause there's bullets in the fire,
I believe I lost my head
Will you ever know what was sent down before those things went

Long before my head had turned to the blue sky speaking words

I'd have to find now, now, now
