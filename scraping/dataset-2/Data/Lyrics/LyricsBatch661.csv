Mark Alexander,"I sit in my living room thinking of you
And the feelings I fear are coming true
And everything about you is wrong I know it
But I still taste you on my tongue
And I still breath you in my lungs
And I wish I could stop breaking down

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul

It's 7:00am and I just want to call you
And tell you I'm falling in love
But, there's somebody else inside these four walls
If she smells you on my skin
I can't let her know where I've been
I wish I could be with you now

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul
Don't tell them anything
And I won't let you go

Don't say a word
Don't tell a soul
And I shiver at the thought of you
I can't believe that you love me too
And we quiver when we touch
I can't believe I love you so much
And I hate it when you walk away
I know we can't go on this way
But there's magic when we touch
I can't believe I love you so much

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul
Don't tell them anything
And I won't let you go

Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud",Love You out Loud,2003
Mark Alexander,"Listen
I was born on the other side
Just always looking to you
I made it over the great divide
Now I'm coming for you

Your forces lined up in battle
Your soldiers and your machines
The sun been blacked out by shadows
The darkest hour now you've ever seen

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

I rose up on the doctor's slab
Like Lazarus from the pit
And everyone wants to take a stab
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit

I've been held up on money
I've been beaten out of spite
You want a piece of me honey?
Lose or win

You know you've been in a fight
And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and
Tear him down.

Now there ain't much difference
Between a bridge and a wall
Without me right in the middle baby
You'll be nothing at all

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

Try and tear me down",Tear Me Down,2003
Mark Alexander,"Took a walk down paramount
(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train
(I've seen better days)
What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things
In my better days

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days",Better Days,2009
Mark Ameson,"Well, here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

Always just beyond my touch
You know I needed you so much
After all, what else is livin' for?

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all",After All,2005
Mark Ameson,"Never mind all the things you heard about me
You're never gonna understand it
Every time that I've given you the truth
It's never made a bit of difference

Disappointment takes you
Then the doubt, it breaks you
It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Never mind what you think that you had seen
It all can change in just a moment
Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe,2005
Mark Ameson,"You're struttin' into town like you're slingin' a gun
Just a small town dude with a big city attitude
Honey are you lookin' for some trouble tonight
Well alright

You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with the flash of your pearly smile
Honey but you met your match tonight
Oh, that's right

You think you'll knock me off my feet
'Til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is cryin' Indian and I'm begin' for more
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for

If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it

Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well you ain't so strong, won't be long 'til your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in
Dead or Alive
That's right

You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back
'Cause I'm ready baby
Aim and fire
Baby there's nowhere you gonna run tonight
Ooh That's right

Well you've had your way with love but it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away

So come on baby
Come on baby

Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say

If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it

Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames

You think you'll knock me off my feet
'til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is cryin' Indian and I'm begin' for more

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on

If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it

I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames

Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

I'm gonna shoot ya down Jesse James",Just Like Jesse James,2005
Mark Ameson,"Asking me discretely, when she can come meet me, later on tonight 
Talking super softly, how we both look gothy, but it's alright

Mark Anthony,"I speak to you in Jesus's name
As Jesus speaks through me,
The evil we do can't be blamed upon our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death-row to the shore
I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior, my Salvador!

It took me four years to learn
I was in prison not in church.
And two more to begin the book of my soul's search.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

A wild boy from the streets of El Barrio
An orphan from the hills of Mayagez

And when I wrote my story
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write I'll be transferred far away.
I'm leaving Greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the Latin population will soon be minus one.

Time is an ocean of endless tears.

I know how hard it's been for you these many years,
You say the Aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at El Malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son.

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street.
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state.

Correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
The politics of race.

A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white

If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write.

You were a child of sixteen
With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and batter",Loves Me Like a Rock,2015
Mark Anthony,"I been sleeping on the roof of my building
It's cooler than the street
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm living
Well they won't last for all of us
But they'll last for a long summer night
I can feel the fire in her eyes
Tonight, tonight
Under satin summer skies

Be my special one

You feel your peel so fine
I'm Hernandez, the umbrella man
Your future's locked in mine
The chaplains, and the golden guineas
The red wings and the crowns
The mighty mau maus, those shines from Brooklyn
They want to cut the vampires down, down
The savage skulls, the Fordham baldies
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this.

I think we got something to talk about
You're a coolie from the turf
That's cool, but you don't get no respect around here unless you belong to a bopping gang...
I mean, you either belong or you get hurt
Or you can buy some protection from me.

I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds

It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here

Stop playing you gamin'
I gotta leave you alone

Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here

Ain't nothing you can say to me that can change my mind

Mark Arneson,"You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last, to last
Cause baby you know I'm worth it

Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth

Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

If you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
Cause baby I know you're worth it

She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth

Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (spelled out for you)
Just hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value (better value)

Down Ketucci's last a.m.
With gufs and drafts and words of hope
And sleep around the bend

Throw the curtain back, take in the fresh air
Let the radio remind you
Listen to the things we say when we should be asleep
The purity of consciousness will never run as deep

Throw the curtain back, step inside my mind
Stroll around the grounds for hours
Every night she comes to me in conversation and in dream
I'm lonely as I'll ever be, at least I'm goin' home

Timmy and I were never more aware
Of what went wrong
So we pulled anchor for the shore
We'd been here for too long

Troll the outer banks, work against the tide
Float until your problems drift away
Every night she comes to me in conversation and in dream
I'm lonely as I'll ever be, at least I'm goin' home

Strings on my fingers and nothin' to fear
It's hot in this kitchen, I'm startin' to fry
Halfway to nowhere and hung out to dry

My view was an eagle's so I flew far and wide
Every new vision the further I'd glide
It's thin in this airway, I start to come down
Halfway to nowhere with my feet on the ground

My words are wise when I disguise them
But deep inside I bleed
I search for perfection everywhere that I roam
My head on the highway and my heart safe at home

But I'm closer to perfect, she's further from me
Halfway to nowhere and achin' to be, achin' to be, yeah

",Halfway to Nowhere,2000
Mark Bryan,"I was stuck at Sticky's on a Friday in July
All my friends were somewhere else
They never wondered why

A crowded table near me
Was probably feeling tight
So I stayed in the corner
And I think I drank all night

The less that you can see me
The less I have to say
But if it's up to me I'll fade away

I was reminiscing with the one that got away
But my heart just dropped
And my mouth just stopped
There was nothing else to say

I could see right through her
As the truth fell from the sky
And the walls around came crashing down
And the future drifted by

The more that you can see me
The less I have to say
But if it's up to me I'll fade away

More than one way to skin a dog
You say who's had his day
So take my hand and come
With me and we'll fade away

Raindrops on the windshield
Headlights in your eyes
In another lonely city
On another sleepless night

The more that you see through me
The less I have to say
But if it's up to me, I'll fade away

You know she's gone for good and you miss her
You think she's coming home and you're wasted

And you wake to find
That if you care then you'll be there
You gotta try a little harder
It just takes time

Stopped in town yesterday on my way to Baltimore
To play for the evening, I never thought to call
And I learned today that it'll never be the same
You can't recapture anything that isn't of it's time

But if you care then you'll be there
You gotta try a little harder

It just takes time, it just takes time
And it just takes time

And we're out of touch but

Headlines that I've casually read
Nothing good can be spoon fed it's obvious
I'm taking off into thin air, if I never land I don't care
As long as I am happy there, I'm there to stay

And the shadows are growing longer with the evening
I can hear a melody from far away
Drums are pounding, guitars slowly grieving
As the sun sheds it's last light upon the day

Melodies mysterious, the music is to serious
Chalk it up to experience and wander on
Seasons change but don't inspire the words
That work but aren't for hire
They're hanging off the thinning wire that is my brain

And the shadows are growing longer with the evening
I can hear a melody from far away
Drums are pounding, guitars slowly grieving
As the sun sheds it's last light upon the day

I feel it till I strike a note
That's sure to set my head afloat
With remedies, anecdotes I'm needing
As I head through space unknown
I'll take my first few steps alone
And hope that I'm not plain out prone and broken

And the shadows are growing stronger with the evening
I can hear a melody from far away
Drums are beating, guitars slowly grieving
As the sun sheds it's last light upon the day

",Last Light,2000
Mark Bryan,"The winds out on the highway carry other every man's tune
If you're going our way we'll see you there soon
The wings of an angel traded for wheels
Words aren't important if you know how it feels

Soon the sun will be gone, tie another one on
Frustrated and broken but lingering on
Praying this desire will never be gone

The warmth of a stranger can be found in his ear
The worst of your dangers is found in your fear
So drink another, coin a phrase
We'll be home one of these days

And you know the story goes on
You know the story goes on
Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on

It's a story of patience and faith till the end
No one's gonna break down but we've all got to bend
Like Call and Augustus when the dove is alone
We continue with a passion, destination unknown

So pull up a chair and open your mind
We'll be around for a long long time
And you know the story goes on
You know the story goes on

Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on, take it all night
Don't let 'em get the best of you now, don't put up a fight

The groove out on the highway is as long as it seems
From one joint to another as you follow your dreams
Through fables anon without a moral to lend
'Cause you can't have a moral if the story won't end

And you know the story goes on
You know the story goes on
Can't have a memory if you've never been gone
You know the story goes on
Can't have a memory if you've never been gone

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face

As he carried you away
From your father's hand

Reaching out to make you pay
He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

It tells me where you've been through
I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I need to bury the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden

Mark Capon,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1999

Mark Carter,"Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine;
Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Mark Casstevens,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

I'm down here at the bottom
And I guess that's where I'll stay

And everything we said we made sure the neighbors heard

But to walk away from love was more than we could do
It was almost goodbye

When I opened up my eyes
Outside I could hear a mockingbird
And I could feel your heartbeat as you laid there by my side
I thought of how the world could end with just one word

Goodbye comes hard for me

I love you , now your free

You know she always thought pretty well of me
She said that the wedding went fine 
And you were up in New York on your honeymoon
Tonight I'm down, in Tennessee

I got that letter you wrote, it tore me up
But I don't have anyone to blame but me
I had it all for a while but like everything else
I messed it up

in the river of love a little too soon.

After all the hell I've put her through
And the times I've let her down
She has more faith in me than anyone has ever found
Heaven knows how much I need her

She says, ? Boy, I still love you ?
Oh she's stronger than the ninety proof
I sent coursing through my veins
She says, ?Don't give up the fight
Before long you'll get it right ?
I pray to God someday I feel the same
Sunday morning beside her in the pew
Through blood shot eyes I try to see her point of view

And in the crowd that gathered ?round, there you stood
When it finally came your turn to say goodbye
Right then and there, I watched you break down and cry

And that's when I knew I was dreamin'
The vision was too good to be true
It'd take much more than just me dying
For me to ever see that side of you

At first I thought you were an angel
Waiting there to carry me away
Then the pain left my heart when I felt your touch

Than home sweet mobil home in his truck headlights

All I saw was a vacant lot

Wonderin' where she hauled it away
Yeah she's on a roll, which way do I go
I've been through every single trailer park and KOA
She's been mad before, but never this sore
You can surely bet from now on
I won't wander from from her lovin' arms
If I ever find my way back home

Guess my homeless situation is partly my fault
For another thousand dollars down I could have bought
That house in the country that she loved so much
With all that brick and wood there ain't no way it would budge
It's easy now to figure out where I went wrong
But a little harder finding love that's gone

Coming down, droppin' fast
I got a feelin' that it's gonna last
Here I come baby ooh, ooh, ooh

Smooth sailin' on a sea of love or
Runnin' aground on a rocky shore

Says he's only lookin' out for me

And discovered that you got no reason staying up
Right at the moment when
The caffine is kickin' in

So you break down and give an old girlfriend a call
Then after two hours of hearing her mindless talk
You remember what you dumped her for
And you wish you hadn't opened that door

Got something rollin' round loose inside

And max out your credit cards

Uptown, uptight, you?re way a living.

You got your powdered up painted on lipstick.
I got a hole in my brand new jeans.
You?d never be caught dead in a pickup.
I?d get mud in your limousine.

So what are we doing love. 
You tell me, cause I give up.
The odds are stacked a hundred to one.
So what are we doing in love.

Sweet tea, cornbread, fried green tomatoes, football, nascar, Redman chew.
You?re sweet champagne and caviar kisses.
I?m cheeseburgers and 90 proof.
I?m a dirt poor redneck cowboy.
You?re a woman of the world.
I don?t know what you see in my brown eyes. 
You can do so much better than me.

About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said two hundred agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

'Son', his daddy told him, 'Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with a hundred proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew?

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road

Sunshine seems to keep you off my mind

Lord, what did I do the night before?
My friends give me the same old answers
And I promise I won't do that anymore

Moving to the back porch blues
The guitar cries, telling me about the hard times

Something moves in the shadows
Giving me a little chill

Walking out across the field

There ain't hardly nobody
Left who even knows the tale
Gimme the blues at the Tunica motel.

And these streets ain't divorcing us

No cuttin' shorts with us
Here to stay, no abortin us, no extortin' us

When night falls - that's when it all begins
Be prepared; we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend y'all bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm like I'm nervous
Live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Start'n conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in their black magic
Suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready?  Don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti
Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy
Leave all the does behind that act iffy
We got maneuvers that's hard to beat
Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath
C'mon

[Mark Curry]
I told you that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill 
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till it's done
See, I got guns, and I'm sick
See how you said meet me here, and I came quick?
Them same cats on the most wanted list
We can hit them, then straight disappear in the mist
...Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill, and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile; break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening, and, but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work
The whole Brotherhood new verse
Gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat

We going to be eatin' your food
Time up in the new, then torture
I rip a niggas toe nails off
What, I didn't hear the news? 
Five slayin' the law
Man, how I don't want do these cats
I lay mousetraps for those mice-house niggas that house gats
They want to out me
I know killers from down south, B
Who know and understand there ain't a thing sweet about me
I earn my respect, and I was born to wreck
Spit techs by your rockets threw jets
Who's next to get hit by firepower that's so raw?
Go play; 4-4's ready for war

Want to blow, what, what

Benz on the runway
Don't be fooled; still squeeze tools
Money like that; why the fuck I need school?

It's who I hit I knew I hit
Who would understand though?

Program for our own channels
And flannel; this man knew any clan
We're here for the cats in the minivan
Got let this schemey plan
Pay me man, scan
Sex, cars, any money
Sex guard the money
With this gun; it be hard to run me
Get it right, or get it tonight
Better tonight
Set up your wife with the head of the night
Don't fold 'cause my goals embedded with ice
To my tents dimming the light

Now it's flowers; I think you best a round on up
Your entourage - slim chance of y'all gettin' large

Step in a territory that's corrupt, pushin' your luck
Intrudin' wishes is already sowed up; n**** fold up
You and your crew and peoples will get slain
This ain't the place to try and gain fame from
You gets burnt in the streets a n**** worked hard to make
And I'll be damned if I let another brother take it
Alive for his own sake; they better vacate
Promptly, 'fore they get they a** stomped
Listen, take heed to what we sayin', n****s

[Chorus]
We won't lie; sometimes we stick 'em up
Last time, it was enough, though word life some hos did 'em up
And nine glocks set 'em up
I know it was your dough 'cause I was right there when they split it up
I could tell you where to find the corpse
But that cheddar - I'm afraid, dog, that's gone forever

Greed for wealth got us stingy
We got a spot that's hot
N****s envy the fact that we clock mad dough
They want to see us shut down, but, no
I don't think so; the crew is still rakin' the cash flow
For every dime bag sold on this block, we want in
One slug behind the back; it's under the skin
When n****s try to step to the block and Bogard
We can't see it happenin'
Warn them first; get the f*** out of dodge
Better believe that; test it
See if we won't put you on your back, n****s

I'm bringin' more than that four-by-four
Watch me dispose of all y'all
Y'all fraud a** n****s
Tape me reboard a** n****s
Gun bigger than sword a** n****s
Now enter in the ring, gun drawn, makin' moves like pawns
Two at a time, comin' for mine
Like a song, n****, CBS, he can't be serious finesse
He don't believe I keep a gun in the vest

You think you can disgrace this empire we built from scratch?
You stupid; I wouldn't care how ruthless your crew is
We got defense on this area; try to attack
Mad n****s on the barriers that's dyin' of blast back
There be no givin' and no takin', definitely no breakin'
Laws we lay down; here's the situation
Severe torture is what those who don't feel us face
I show no love for a punk-a** n**** we hate
Try to pay me no bribe, then come up missin'
Happens to hard-headed n****s when they don't listen
I gave you fair warnin' 'bout the danger you're messin' with
A stranger invadin' the street corners are goners
Try me, if you think it's a lie, the attitude many n****s had
But in the process many die
Thinkin' they can step to the block and Bogard
And couldn't see it happenin'
Warned 'em first: get the f*** outta dodge

Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted

A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit, burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

Like Milan they run for cover
New 'cause this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is
I'm on it, act like they want it
I'm'll bring the heat
Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan

Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'

Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile

Mark Doyle,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2001
Mark Elf,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2006

I felt a chill go straight through me I've never seen a smile like that
I ain't worried ?bout Bill or Darryl, they're both wearin' wedding bands
The rest of us are fish in a barrel she could have her pick but I understand
She can't save us all from the lonely lives we lead
So bartender would you send her a drink and tell her it's from me

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

I'm not the kind to believe in superstition
Lately the truth I have seen is stranger than non-fiction
You race through my blood, some kind of sweet addiction
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I sleepwalk the streets of this town looking for your face
Ain't got nothing to show right now, but I can't give up the chase
Won't you give me a sign, some kind of saving grace
You're the only one I'm thinking of
Can't get you off my mind

I must be going insane
All these streets look the same
Nobody answers when I call out your name

CHORUS
I need you the most
When you're not around
I'm in love with your ghost
You're invisible now
I know that it's wrong
To keep holding on to something you can't even see

Guess you can already see that my heart is haunted
You are all that I need, everything I've ever wanted
Lost myself somewhere in between, can't you hear me calling
Wish I may, wish I might
First star I chance to see tonight

Wish I could disappear right now
Fade into this faceless crowd
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of missing you out loud

Waiting for slow dances and you ask to walk her home
And if she says please stay, you'll say, ""I might""

You make her laugh then sing that one song to make her cry

Well you think you got troubles
Man listen to me
I'll tell you a story as it happened you see

I got four little kids a-waiting at home
My wife done packed her bags and gone
She done moved on across the tracks
And I know that girl ain't a-coming back

Troubles on my mind
Well I got troubles, hey those lonesome kind

Every morning Å?bout 8 o'clock
The kids start crying and they holler Â³Pop,
Where's my mama? Where's she gone?
And when's my mama gonna come back home?Â²

My little girl is only three
I picked her up and set her on my knee
Try to soothe her crying but she cries too hard
And the crying, oh daddy, well, oh Lord

I know my baby's too young to talk
I sit and watch her try to walk
She's turning around, watching the door
And a big teardrop done hit the floor

Well I told you a story as it happened to me
Just the way that it happened you see
You got a good gal don't you do her no wrong
She'll pack her trunk and then be gone

Then you'll have troubles

Someday we all will have a home
A place to come in from the cold
Somewhere so high above the clouds
Why not here? Why not now?

Pastures of plenty for the tired and poor
Still too many hands empty behind the golden door

Someday we all will have a home
A place to come in from the cold
Somewhere so high above the clouds
Why not here? Why not now?

Someday we all will live the dream
There'll be no cracks to fall between
Somewhere where everyone will have enough
But here and now, it's up to us

Someday we all will be at peace
And all of our suffering will cease
There's more than enough to go around

We are passing this world on to our kids
From the moment that they climb out of their cribs
We try to teach them well
And show them they are loved
But in the end all we can do
Is hope our best is good enough
For they'll witness how this life
Can be so beautiful and cruel
We can't shelter them forever
But if we show them all the tools
They might leave this place in
A little better shape than me and you
We are only passing through

Passing through
Passing through
We are only passing through
Passing through
Passing through
We are only passing through

We've been watching this world from our living rooms
It's been near 40 years since we walked on the moon
And this big blue ball keeps shrinking
And I don't know if that's good
But for better or for worse now
This whole world's our neighborhood
There's no place left to run to
Where you can stay above the fray
We all learn to need to get along
And not just get our way
Not only for each other but
For our children's children too
We are only passing through

CHORUS

I wonder sometimes what I will pass on
And how much can one voice do with just a song
Sometimes injustice and indifference
Are the only things I see
But I refuse to let my hope
Become the latest casualty
So I'll sing of love and truth
And try to practice all I preach
And if I can't change the world
I'll change the world within my reach
And what better place to start
Than here and now with me and you
We are only passing through

You know its over, we’re just wasting time
In search of happy days you know we’ll never find

All that I had inside, I gave it
Tried to believe, in time, I’d save it

Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man

Sits on the porch swing watching them fly

While Levon, Levon slowly dies.

Den jetzt mal jeder von uns selber geht. 
Ich find’s gut, wenn wir uns ne Weile nicht sehn. 
Es lag nicht unbedingt nur an dir, oder an mir! 
Es sind die vielen kleinen Teufel gegen die man verliert, 
Am Schluss nützt all das reden nichts, da helft uns kein Wort mehr!

Es gibt nicht Vieles, was für mich ein harter Schlag wär.
Ich bin schlagfertig, 
Mir fällt schon immer ein Spruch ein,
In jedes Ziel krieg‘ ich relativ schnell Zug rein.
Mir macht auch Stress nix, ich bin verlässlich,
Nur wenn ich betrunken bin
Benehm‘ ich mich oft grässlich,
Bin manchmal hässlich
Und natürlich auch mal schwächlich.
Doch lange dauern diese Phasen bei mir echt nicht.

Hab mir den Kopf kaputt gerannt.
Du knackst mich auf, wie 'ne Nuss,
Brichst die Schale auf,
Du hackst auf mir, wie 'ne Axt,
Schon fällt der Baum,
Packst mich nicht aus, sondern lässt mich im Karton,
Du lässt die Luft raus, wie bei 'nem Luftballon. 
Du wirfst mich raus, aus der Bahn, in der es so gut lief,
Du weckst mich auf, aus dem Traum,
In dem ich grad schlief.
Du packst einen Stein auf den verschlossenen Karton, 
Du lässt die Luft raus, wie bei einem Luftballon.

Was soll ich sagen, kann eigentlich nicht klagen nur,
Das Denken an Dich schlägt mir langsam auf den Magen,
Du bist kein Stein im Bauch, sondern mehr so 
Wie eine Mauer drum,
Auf so eine Art hab ich im Leben keine Frau besungen.
Ich frag mich leise, führt das alles hier zu nix,
Und wäre es besser, verschwände ich jetzt fix.
Was soll er tun, soll er gehen, soll er bleiben,
Soll er schwimmen, soll er treiben, 
Soll er noch ein Liedchen schreiben, ich -

Die ich kaum ertrage und mich ständig selber frage
Warum mich all diese Gefühle plagen die ich nicht kannte
Oder nur vom Hörensagen denn bisher rannte
Ich durch meine Welt und war der König
Doch alles was mir gefällt ist mir jetzt zu wenig
Alles was mich kickte von dem ich nie genug kriegte
Lass ich lieber sein denn ich fühl mich allein
Du fühlst dich nicht nur allein mann du bist es
Drum lass das Gejammer sein denn so ist es
Nun mal auf dieser Weit auch wenns dir nicht gefällt
Schaust du deinen eigenen Film und bist dein eigener Held
Ja mann irgendwie hast du ja recht und trotzdem gehts mir schlecht
Echt beschissen denn ich möchte mal wissen
Welcher Film auf dieser Welt einen Oscar erhält
In dem die weibliche Hauptrolle fehlt

Und ich bin wieder allein allein
Sie ist weg (allein allein)

Sie ist weg (sie ist weg)
Und ich bin wieder allein allein
Sie ist weg (weg)
Davor war's schöner allein zu sein

Ich raff es nicht ab, was ist daran schlimm
Dass ich jetzt nicht mehr der Man für sie bin
Da sitz ich und kack mich zu 
Und beginn zu denken, dass ich keine andere find
Die eine ist weg, na und?
War sie fur dich nicht nur Mittel zum Zweck und Grund
Sich hinter ihr zu verstecken andere abzuchecken war tabu
Und jetzt kommst du

Hm wie gesagt es ist krass, dass ich dachte ich verpass
Was wenn ich die Finger von den andern lass
Was ich machte, denn ich dachte diesen Spaß
Gibst du dir wenn du die eine nicht mehr hast und jetzt was
Jetzt ist sie weg und ich versteck mich kläglich
Hab keine Lust auf andere also leck mich

Doch innerlich raffte ich, Spinner ich null
Denn wann immer ich dachte ich tu alles für sie
War was immer ich machte für mich irgendwie
Mit dieser Philosophie fuhr ich einwandfrei
Sorgenfrei an ihr vorbei
Schätze bin ein bisschen hoch geflogen ungelogen
Und hab sie dabei mit mir selbst betrogen
Kluge Worte was? Hinterher weiß man immer mehr
Doch so sehr ich mich auch dagegen wehr
Bleibt es schwer aber wahr
Ich bin leer denn sie ist nicht da, klar
Ja ja wunderbar tolle Rede, Mann
Hört ich dich nicht mal sagen dich lässt jede ran
Und jetzt schau dich an wo bist du hingekommen
Ich sags dir sie ist weg und hat mich mitgenommen

Krass was mit der Zeit passiert
Wie schnell man den Kontakt verliert
Hab grad gemerkt, dass ich deine neue Nummer nicht hab
Wollt nur mal hören wie's dir geht

Und ich frag mich was du machst

Ich trink auf dich mein Freund
Auf jeden Tag aus unserer Zeit
Auf das was geht und das was bleibt

Ich trink auf dich mein Freund
Ich heb auf dich mein Glas
Auf das was kommt und das was war

Ich schenk mir nochmal nach
Werd langsam sentimental
Es passte nichts zwischen uns beide
Heut hab ich Schiss dir kurz zu schreiben
Sind wir Freunde die sich selten sehen
Oder sind wir keine Freunde mehr
Ey wichtig ist es nicht
Was wir hatten steht für sich

Und wir in andere Richtungen rennen

Auch wenn man Zeit nicht konserviert
Und man sich irgendwann verliert

Mark Forster,"Irgendwie ging’s immer weiter
Nach der Treppe kam die Leiter
Und nach der Leiter kam’ die Wolken
Dann hieß es fliegen oder runterstolpern
Ich hab’ umgeswitcht irgendwo
Von Maverick auf Autopilot
Bin einfach mitgeschwebt solang’ ich konnte
Und hab’ vergessen, wer ich sein wollte

Wie ich bin und wie du mich siehst
Dazwischen gibt’s ein Unterschied
Ich nehm’ die Kamera und halt’ sie still
Komm, ich schieß’ für dich ’n klares Bild

Ich mach’ ’n Bild von mir selbst
Und ich schick’s in die Welt

Frag mich, wie’s dir gefällt
Ich mach’ ’n Selfie
Ein Bild von mir selbst

Irgendwie ging’s immer weiter
Und aus „nix zu tun“ wurd’ „keine Zeit mehr“
Verlorener Überblick in Babysteps
Blinder Tunnelblick das seh’ ich jetzt
Fremdes Spiegelbild im Badezimmer
Doch mein Kern war ma’ da immer
Mein wahres Ich ich will’s dir zeigen
Doch nur mit Worten kann ich’s nicht beschreiben

Ich wünschte, es wär’ alles drauf
Die neuen Träume und die alten auch
All die Narben und die paar Trophäen
Ich wünschte, man könnt’ alles sehen
Auch das letzte Pixel will ich zeigen
Die guten und die schlimmsten Seiten
Ich wünscht’, es ginge auf ein Bild
Denn ich würd’s dir zeigen, wenn du willst

Mark Forster,"Ey stranges, kleines Leben
Verläuft auf Seitenwegen
Ich such' die Mitte, doch mein Glück liegt meist daneben
So selten Flugrakete, bin mehr so Zugverspätung
Doch die Ernte kommt immer man, es ist gut gesät und
Ich hab kein Stress mit warten
Geh' auch durch schlechte Phasen
Ich bin geduldig und nehme zum Schluss die besten Karten
Und fällt der Jenga Turm, egal gib' mir Verlängerung
Halt neuer Plan dann, denn Leben ist Veränderung

Egal was kommt, es wird gut, sowieso
Immer geht 'ne neue Tür auf, irgendwo
Auch wenn's grad nicht so läuft, wie gewohnt
Egal, es wird gut, sowieso

Verrückte, bunte Reise
Mal Tinnitus und mal leise
Der Beat selbst wächst, vom Steuerrad-Rumgereiße
So selten fitte Planung, bin mehr so dritte Mahnung
Doch immer sicher im Gemetzel, dank der schicken Tarnung
Ich schätze Wegbegleiter, auch wenn alles seine Zeit hat
Mal elf Freunde, dann doch One-on-One Karatefighter
Und steigt der Sendeturm bleibt immer die Erinnerung
Halt neuer Plan, dann den Blick nach vorn, Stück Linderung

Egal was kommt, es wird gut, sowieso
Immer geht 'ne neue Tür auf, irgendwo

Dann der Tag, los, raus aus dem Kinderzimmer
Auf einmal alle weg, nichts so wie immer
Kurz geguckt, was am weitesten weg ist
Dann alle Koffer rein in den Kombi von Daddy
Erste Nacht, Matratze auf Parkett
Erst so fremd, dann ging ich nicht mehr weg
Auf Safari, durch U-Bahn und Kneipen

Kopf voll, wir sehen doch keiner wartet
Dann die Komplizen von irgendwo angespült
Alles möglich und wir so mittendrin
Und dann die Party bei Bekannten
Wollt' grad gehen, weil ich kaum jemand kannte
Dann dieses Mädchen mit dem Tier auf'm Shirt
Mein Herz sagt tschüss, weil's jetzt ihr gehört
Und plötzlich Schluss mit Spielchen
Next Level jetzt, aus mir wird vier und

Und heb' mein Glas auf das was kommt

Als wär' das U-Boot kurz vorm Sinken

Als käm' jetzt gleich die Dramahook, wie bei Coldplay
In meinem Kopf spielt ein Quartett
So schrecklich rhythmisch
Als wär' die Stadt evakuiert, weil's kein Zurück gibt
Als bliebe Kevin ganz allein, weil er nichts mitkriegt
Als könnt' man alles dazu fühlen, doch nie sich glücklich

Vielleicht lief es zu perfekt, und jetzt kommt's wie's kommen musste
Ich hol' sie nach Haus', meine abgefuckten Muster
Mein easy Weg aus Holz, der verlockend glänzt wie Gold
Und mich immer wieder kreutzt, Willkommen zurück!

Ich hab die ganze Zeit geahnt, dass ihr mit dabei wart
Und alles, was mich vor euch schütze, ist auf einmal weg

Klick-Klick-Klack
Als wär's ein Morsealphabet
Ist nichts hartes, wär' in meinem Kopf ne' 8O8

Als wär' die Zeitbombe soweit, dass sie jetzt platzt
Ich fühl' den Beat bis in den Bauch

I know I know I know I came a long way
Oh yeah with from my heart knock all day
I kill a killed with a spitter 9 mm on my hip with the debt
Then sign me a dealer
Had it hard so you been a nigga cry me a river
'Cause I'm from the piss and life's grind me his liver
I mean it's spitter then brooder then fruit her
Then I'm really little 
Got a brother and a sister and I'm in the middle
Mother tryin' to figure out how to we me a dinner
Then I had a piece of bread for my little nigga
'Cause he waiting outside 
Too shy to ask and too young to die
Too weak to rob and too good to lie
Two years go by, he a killer
Pissed up high the pillar then he go to work
Monkey see monkey do grow the gorilla
So he turn another wife into a widow
Which turned another son into a bidder
Root of all evil it's all lethal 
Injection without interjecting for people
Fall back but ain't no kush around here
This is my block call a cock block
'Cause ain't no pussy round here

If he'll keep it up he'll be a chop head

'Cause sometimes it could've gotten messy
Like if my shot came and left me
Still acting willin' dumb and thirsty
Still saying come and test me
Still selling crack by young ol Wesley

Y'all don't know a thing, about my life
(my life) my life (my life)

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

[Chorus: x4]

In my life, I went from a straw hat to a crown
I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

[Chorus: x4]

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just want to be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggas, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

My life-my life-my life-my life, is all I got
Fuck with my life-my life-my life-my life, and you will get dropped

Count out David, what did you find?

There's a warrior coming, on your front
There there, the baby arrows
But they can't hurt you even if they try
There there, they're like baby arrows

They're a heartbeat that just twists in your eye

Mark Germino,"There's a disc jockey in Hartlanberg 
Who works at W.A.N.T. 
He puts two or three eggs in him 
And he's in your car by 6.00 am 

He lives for his job and he accepts his pay 
You can call and request ‘Lay Lady Lay' 
He'll play Stanley Jordan, The ‘Dead and Little Feat 
And he'll even play the band from the college down the street 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's forty-seven, goin' on sixteen 
His request line's open, but he'll tell you where to go 
If you're dumb enough to ask him why he plays Hank Snow 

Well, he tries to keep his talkin' to a minimum 
He's a Democrat, he's a Republican 
He's an ad man with a great voice, say some 
But when he spins those records he's neither one 

He'll talk to the truckers on the interstate strip 
The housewife and the car dealership 
And when his second wife left him for a paper millionaire 
He cried unashamedly right on the air 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's forty-seven, goin' on sixteen 
His request line's open but he makes no bones 
About why he plays Madonna after George Jones 

Now, one day a man in a pinstriped suit 
Took the owner of the station to a restaurant booth 
His pitch was simple, “you'll increase your sales 
“If you only play the song list we send in the mail.” 

He guaranteed a larger audience 
Less confusion and higher points 
“But your drive-time jock won't get to do his thing. 
“Hey he's not half bad, tell me, what's his name?” 

Well his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's frequently heard, but he's seldom seen 
His formula's simple and his format's big 
“I just play anything, you call and tell me what you dig.” 

Now Rex Bob David Saul Lowenstein 
Quit his job a week later, but before he'd leave 
He locked and bolted the control room door 
And played smash or trash till they cuffed him on the floor 

Well they drug him into court and the judge said, “Rex 
“I've got to lock you up, for what I'm not sure yet. 
“But your boss here says he thinks you're wrapped too tight. 
“But, by the way thanks for playing ‘Moon River' last night” 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's a flaming bell inside a tambourine 
He could play it all if he was just set free 
Just to find what the people WANT 
Just to find what the people WANT 
Just to find what the people WANT ",Rex Bob Lowenstein,1991

And Ive watched love pass you by
At times I think were drifters

Love has a hold on me

Where do I come from
Where does life mean
Is it not to know the one who made me

As I'm looking down the road ahead
Love has a hold on me
Someday when I breathe my dying breath
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

Where will I go
When this life is through
Back into the light that made me and you

Love has a hold on me
Something opened up my eyes to see
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

I don't have answers to all the questions
Running inside of my mind
But I can't help believe that
Understanding comes in time

Love has a hold on me
Something opened up my eyes to see
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

If I run, if I hide, I know inside
Your love has a hold on me
Tell me yes, tell me no, my heart will follow
Your love has a hold on me

If I run, if I hide
Your love has a hold on me
Your love has a hold on me
Your love has a hold on me
Hold on me",Love Has a Hold on Me,1994
