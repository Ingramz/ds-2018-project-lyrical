Jay-Z,"""Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow""

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'al

Yeah, uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov', that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said ""Hov', it ain't many of us""
I told 'em ""Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us""

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

Cake, cake cake, cake cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake cake, cake cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

Yeah, uh, look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg",Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2,2013
Jay-Z,"Walking around middle of the night
My enemies like with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next to it
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out something might go down
Good I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level
And even when you speak regular it's freaky girl, I say OK
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
The bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down

Watch it get down, watch it get down

You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I'll be down and throw it at that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chic
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better, better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down to go to that level

Oh that girl is murder

Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kabooms
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck, she's

From cuttin' solid Purico to stack Fritos
went from grams to kilos
Mac in one hand, in the other hand grands and see-notes
game got my eyes wider than a 430 Buggy
no tellin' what the fuck I'll do for this money
stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
the thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
as I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
palmin' hammers
think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
takin' over with the Mafia
hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
the cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
confront frontin' niggas like ""You want it? well nigga, me too""
what the fuck, I'm callin' your bluff, niggas act like they stopped
makin' guns after they made yours
I'm sponsored by the NRA, DOA rules
grin and stand over your coffin like ""Hey you!""
tell the Devil I'm comin', keep it hot
for now I got my eyes on a billboard spot
don't stop. 

[Chorus 2X]
Die for it
take the stand, lie for it
blow trial, get up in the chair and fry for it
never tellin' or snitchin'
rather swim with the fish'n
mothafucka respect it, the commission

[Verse 2]
(First 4 lines with Jamaican accent)
I buy and sell bricks with my nigga P.D.
down with the team called B.B.E.
now if you want to join the team you know you must see me
buy ya can't talk to FEDS or dick R.I.D. 
It's a cold World baby boy, fuck it, I'm colder
Animals on my back keep my warm, my armor
Frank Lucas persona, warmin' coke up in the sauna
let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
infact it's drastic
a couple Million in the mattress
with a safe dick I say fuck taxes
rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
crime pays 
nigga, Nine-Hundred and Ninety-Nine ways
my destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
while my enemies smile, buried in style
Gucci suits and cufflings
sneakin' drugs through Heavens customs.

POP POP POP! warning shot, who's to blame
Shyne mothafucka, don't forget the name
stretch the Caine, to cop the house and the plane

fuck the FEDS, 2 green and one red
Firm tight, hold the dice in this game of life
Aces suffice

Fallen Angels and Angel dust
my team do dirt to avoid layin' in the dust
Million dollar portraits in my fortress

bloodstainin', aeroplanin', Four-Hundred horses slow
Platinum cable, round table, so all the bosses know

Before rap, Young really got dough
Before rap, Young really seen snow
In the kitchen ‘bout to make some magic
Then blow it all in Magic, pull up to my partner in traffic
Gave it to him, it was all in plastic
All I know, I ain’t tryna go to jail
Heard that shit closest thing to hell
When it's stepped on make it hard to sell
When you been where I been, make it hard to fail

Even back then they was calling me ten chains
Ask me what I spent, I tell ‘em it’s no thing
Even if I had to add it up, it’da cost like ten things

If it’s on the floor nigga, its the floor money
If you brought it out to blow, when you got it from the blow
Then that’s why the fuck they call that shit blow money
Still the realest nigga in this, y’all know it
Kept it one hundred ‘til the day I came through
My nigga hit me up saying “going out of town”
So I threw him fifty thou, told him “bring me back two”
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed
Called this little piece up, got laid
Then he walked in, threw them both on the table said
“Fuck that shit, young nigga get paid”

She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters

What was you preparing us, for?

Did you see the runt as the front-runner
Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldn't function
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that

Why do I keep on running away?

Took for my child to be born
See through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song
I don't deserve you, I harass you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome, you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Said: ""Don't embarrass me,"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday, you mature faster than me
I wasn't ready, so I apologize
I've seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the woman whom I
Toyed with you emotions because I was emotionless
I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time you wasted it, on all this basic shit
So I apologize

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should

I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive now
Meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We're supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our hearts stop
And then we end a space with a dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit?

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should

And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake

Came through the bushes smelling like roses I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe I'm talking busting off the roof
Hold a uzi vertical, let the thing smoke

Shout out to all the murderers turned murals, plural, fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out to Nostrand Ave, Flushing Ave, Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes

Must be in the air, oh can't walk away I know ,I know

Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

Such a fucking scam
That's why its so hard to survive in this so called promise land
You gotta do what you got to do to get by
Facilitate that permanent high
Smoke filled lungs inside of you
Its hard to dream of glory when you got something to prove
Sometimes were all victims of depression and unrest
Some people got no heart that's just the way its always been
Some never find what their looking for
Few get what they want and fewer get more
Sometimes you got to cross that line
When you ain't got enough to get by

I walk a path I know so well
I feel lost in a familiar way another memory I can't explain
'Cause its the bottle that seems to flow
Through another day of the drunk unknown
I'm looking for a fight at 11.15 on a Saturday night

Wake up on Sunday morning
To the sound of breaking glass & sirens calling
Bricks & bottles in the street
Alert the police, it's a state of emergency

And the traffic lights all go blinking red
And a voice on the radio says 'get out while you can'
And in the gridlock panic sets in
And there ain't no engine built fast enough
To out ride the Armageddon
And if you don't give it up I'm gonna take it
And how long did you think you could keep me tricked?
I'll be cold walking through the back bay flinging bricks",State of Emergency,2001

That I let cross my mind
You're out of my hopes

Where the sun just burns
Old porch missin' 
A board or two
Mail box hangin' 
From one lone screw
There's a broken window 
Round to the side

If I really tried

What would I do

Are better left alone
I'd probably learn 
Real fast

Through broken windows

With your same old ways
Thinking I'd forgotten 
The darkest days
Where there was no line 
And there was no love
This place 
Is better off boarded up
Here I stand 
At this window pane
Hoping somethin' in there 
Might have changed

The way a silly little child would.

I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
He didn't mean it,
I should have seen it,
But now it's too late.

Now it seems,
This is how the story ends:

Not for long,
I can see the way this ends:

Why should I cry,
Heave a sigh,
And wonder why,
And wonder why?

I flip my chip, top
Whig mop
I feel so quivery

It's like a trumpet man that blows high sea

I want a hip, hop
Clap, clop
When sweet lips kisses me

It's like a breeze
Caressing the apple tree
It's ecstasy

It happens every day
Oh boy, you'll never hear me say, woah boy
Whenever sweet lips starts in kissin' me

Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine.
Be careful, it's my heart.
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Make it come

I used to live in darkness
A life without your eyes
With no direction
Empty reflections
As clouds without the sky
But ever since you came to me
All my fear is gone
There's no pain
You feel the same
Now we always will be as one

All light shines from your eyes

De ojos verdes como el billete

Me gusta la calle

Me puedo quedar jugando grandes autos todo el día

Desde el 2000 tengo la cuenta salda

Y tengo como 10000 en la espalda

Ya no fumo chelo

Hice mis promesas con dios en el cielo

Deje la marihuana
Y de la noche a mañana
Probé la fama
Y vi como se me viraron par de panas

Millonario yo voy
Yo te lo dejo caer
Ando en la troca con asientos en piel
Es difícil que oficina recogiendo al killer

Con tantos roles encima
El nada que ver
Perovoy tranquilo
Bien vestido

Los pies en la tierra
Y en nadie confío con todos sonrío
Pero nada les fío antes no eran nada

On the phone, get the ho, everywhere we go
And if not, nigga please on your mom
Trigger squeeze, under these
While I fuck up one of these

Cause it's funk in the back
Cause the trunk gettin' track
Jump off, run back
Come back, cause they like that raw shit
They want that, jump back when I kiss myself

I took L's with bad B's, my ex girls they hate me
Run like Eddie Lacy, from problems I'm escaping
I sing to these bad hoes like JoJo and K-Ci
Empty bottles of whiskey, ask my ex if she miss me
Can't deal with all the lulls so the drugs keep me lifted
Mama says I'm gifted, dad says I drink too much
But he don't really get it, adults just really think too much
And all I know is temporary fixes for permanent pains
And sacrificin' family for personal fame
And actin' really selfish for personal gains
And poppin' hella pills and goin' insane
I know I acted up girl hope you call me again
I know it's hard to tell but I'm strivin' to change
And you hopin' I do, but you ready if not
You know bein' let down, 'cause it's happened a lot

Said you were tired of the city when you makin' a move?
Said you goin' to L.A., you got nothing to lose
Me or your sanity you got something to choose
What's my first name, Skizzy
Put out the joint and lit it
You used to be timid
The memories are vivid
Cigarettes on stoops keep me in the loop
You've gone through it all barely twenty-two
You just ready for a dog and a scenic view
Got some weed in your coat, C Goose when it's cold
Take a drive to the beach, bring some cigs for the road
Started out as a joke, now it's out of control
Scared of silence and all, scared of bein' alone
And when I'm not at your house I get high on my own

I found myself underwater
Bye-bye big high, I'm fallin' farther
Come back to me and hit me harder

I know the high was never real
'Cause I don't feel the love no more

Is where I made my home, my home, my home

You were stumbling a new way down, 
Falling on you're broken wings,

She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out

And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong

Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder

Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy

부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다

Hello!

Have^ you ever thought^ as the hearse goes by
That^ you may be the next to die?
They wrap you in a big white sheet
And then they burry you eight feet deep*
And then
Your casket^ begins to leak!
Ah ha!*

The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out
The worms play pinochle on your snout
Your liver^ turns a slimy green
And pus runs out like big whipped^ cream
Your eyeballs, they turn to cherry red*
And that's what you look^ like^ when you are dead

How my heart has cried
Storm the gates of heaven

I was there at the witchcraft trials
I was there when they murdered Montezuma
And they destroyed the Aztec empire

And to steal other people's land
Using His name to persecute
And take away the freedom of Man
And take away the freedom of Man

Jayne Mansfield,"The French are glad to die for love.
They delight in fighting duels.
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels.
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental,
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat.

Men grow cold 
As girls grow old,
And we all lose our charms in the end.

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer

But get that ice or else no dice.

He's your guy 
When stocks are high,
But beware when they start to descend.

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic,
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes.

Time rolls on,
And youth is gone,
And you can't straighten up when you bend.

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees,
You stand straight at Tiffany's.

Don't have to buy me diamonds and pearls
Champagne, sables and such
I never cared much for diamonds and pearls
But honestly honey, they just cost money
Give me your hand when I've lost the way
Give me your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is bright or gray give me your heart to rely on
Send me the warmth of a secret smile 
To show me you haven't forgot
Now and forever , that always and ever
Little things mean a lot",Little Things Mean a Lot,2002
Jayne Paterson,"She wears a long fur coat of mink 
Even in the summer time 
Everybody knows from the coy little wink 
The girl's got a lot on her mind 

She's got big thoughts, big dreams 
And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl
She really wants, to be in love with a man 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much 

She saw him standing in the section marked 
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie 
She threw him bread and said make me scream 
In the dark what could he say 

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby 
Diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much 
 
They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove to fifty five Secret street 
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent 
Love is forever that's all your life 
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous, lead

The glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

Lead, the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love, it ain't much, it ain't much",The Glamorous Life,1973
Jayne Wisener,"Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars

How can you remain
Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?
How is it you sing?

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody
Constantly floating?
Is it rejoicing or merely a loaming?

Are you discussing?
Or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?
Are you screaming?
Ring dove and Robinet

Is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my Lark

Larks never will, you know
When they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive

Nightingale, Blackbird
Teach me how to sing

If I cannot fly
Let me sing

Through a cold mechanical maze
I am lost and confused
I am always the loser
You tell me there's a place
Where I can be alive

Is it near is it far is it somewhere between
This land you say exists that I've never seen
Call me please talk to me tell me the truth
I need to believe like a house needs a roof
Is it strange is it wonderful I need to know
Do you have a picture that you can show
The minute to capture the moment has come
The minute to capture the moment has come

It's easy to believe
But less easy to imagine
I've grown so used to not coping
Waiting eternally hoping
Wishes come and go
But this one will stay I know
Could the time for adventure be
Just around the corner

Do you have a picture that you can show
The minute to capture the moment has come
The minute to capture the moment has come

I wonder if it's true
Do I put my faith in you
Do I risk one more failure
To add to this tale
Or do I turn my back
And slowly walk away

[Verse 1]
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the ho's want to get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin to the picnic
But somethin's missin, wake up and stop dreamin
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park before two
And everybody know what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
So I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took fo' hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin on the curb, for four fuckin hours dog
Thinkin bout my homie in the pen, lil boss hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin when I was sleepin
On them fools on the otherside who call themselve's creepin
But see sucka, gangs a nation crew
And everybody knows what the fuck we gon do

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip

I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin go bullet lock it's ya birthday
My homie b.k., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them ho's wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
niggaz gettin bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin the muthafuckin cabbage patch

Grew up funk like Davis now I got braids like Stevie Wonder 
Get my sag on my momma get her dag on 
Freeze my khaki's up and I'm gone 
You can stare all day but just don't step 
on my Blue Suede shoes to get here I pay dues 
BRRAOW BRAOW that's how my toolie sound 
when I'm drinkin Hen with my rhymes straight blowin in the wind 
And busters can't fade the Jayo Felony 
T-Funk from the family, smoke or dip with me 
Bullet Locc's dedicated, faded, I straight made it 
And drinkin Blue Note, on the yard they celebrated 
I'm a why-see, I guess that's why the one-time is followin me 
But I'm a MC, I laugh because there swallowin me 
But I just shake my head and say ""Damn!"" (Ha ha)

You go do your thang yo, and I'ma do my thang 
You go do your thang yo, and everythang gon' be everythang 

I want to be like Donald Trump, not Willie Lump-Lump

Fool don't move until my ride hit the flo', word!

And I'm just tryin to keep my sanity 
Make some of them ends, get a biz and help my family 
Right, and just to let you know I don't care 
I'm still gon' get my sag on, there it is there 
You can't see me fool, I'm locced out 
Baseheads on the corner, bag and smoked out 
Askin for a gang of change and I say ""Damn!""

She's made 'cause the Soul Glo won't make her hair grow 
Block on the phone, and ain't nobody home 
Her and some greasy fat fool rollin in the Brougham 
But you know how that go, so yo, toss em up high 
'cause in the South Beach streets it's do or die 
Wave em to the Eastside, yeah wave em to the West

So all you so called players better hide in the Valley 
'Cause real G's put the Killer in Cali

I don't think none of y'all want to test this 
From bus tokens and transfers to Lexus 
Never sex less, they all want the pipe layer 
I come bang on that ass so I can get player player 

The way that I operate will thrill you for days 
To all my niggas turnin' green in the face from eatin' microwave meals, 
And I kill off a whole fuckin' race 
Now I arrive to you and rock the whole fuckin' place 

Hear me now, it's bully loco, baby 
And if I could I'd play em all 'cause they skanless and shady, nigga 
Don't put your hands on em, 'cause they lock that ass up 
But they try to hold me down so I can knock that ass up 

You got me fucked up in the realest way, or do I feel this way

You never paid him no attention so who should he love 
And to keep a strap on him or a phat sack on him 
And some bomb but be patrollin' the hood 
Ran a hoe's name through the mud 
And these crooked's stick a strap in your mouth, without a doubt

For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees

Mad shout, 'cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin'
I'm an Alkaholik and I'm late for my meeting

Round and round we go, it don't stop
Till we all get dough, come on, make it hot
Baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin' good with your stink-ass
Type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast
Make it hot, baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop

Rollin' through the hood
To find the boys
Kick dust and cuss, crank up some noise
Police on my drawers

40 Ounce's in my lap and it's freezin' my balls
Hook a right turn, let the boys go past
Then I say to myself: ""They can kiss my ass!""

Ridin' on ??? weed is on ???
Turned down the sound
And ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause old bitch almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tilt cause I was drunk
See an enemy on mine, had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all ?? cause
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the heat
And like a mirage
A busta like that got out of dodge
Sucker's on me cause the title I'm holdin'

Stepped on your foot, cold dissed your ho'
Asked her to dance and she said: ""Hell no!""
Called her a bitch cause that's the rule
(Bitch, who d'you callin' a bitch?)
Boyz in the hood tryin' to keep me cool
Tell your homeboy you want to kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get 'em up

I'm screamin as I'm dreamin  I see evil bad spirits 

So I wake up in the middle of the night to write lyrics 

In a cold sweat  heard magnums in my dreams  my ears ring 

So this time on the mic I bring horror like Stephen King 

All my good times are turned bad like the Evan's 

Seen hundreds get wounded but like a thousand 187's 

Everybody that was so real  they were now phony 

And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me 

I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him 

The nigga know too much about me, so it's a must that I kill him 

If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it 

'cause now I see the chair rockin, but ain't nobody in it 

I'm psycho like Norman Bates in the fresh side of my mind and 

All I think about is comittin redrums like The Shining 

So Lord please help me and forgive me for my sins 

And tell me, why do I deserve the twilight zone that I'm in? 

Somebody ease the pain I need a shot of novacaine 

Or angel dust smoke circulatin through my brain 

So who got the slaughter water, la la the brain killer 

I got five on it, four stick, to the first dealer 

With no screws left it's like my head is now hollow

Uh huh
Get low baby!
Come on!

[Verse 1]
It's the end of the world now, yeah! Don't start runnin
But could you possibly run when you know that God's comin?
But we got a lot of hard heads that don't seem concerned, what?
So eternally, you burn
An eternity's a long long time, so I wrote a strong rhyme
For these Mc's that only talk about chrome nines
Pay attention to each line, I'm about to reach mine
Be careful 'cause they might heat you for just one dime
Blaze up and won't think twice about ya, we dyin quicker
He's dead so what the hell could he do with some liquor?
No value for human life
Can't understand how a woman could leave a baby in the trash can
Damn, helpless and starvin, but that's how life goes
Can't aford him? Then keep your legs closed
Thinkin God won't punish you for what you put that child through
Havin babies like it's the thing to do
What is this world coming to?

[Chorus] X 2
Don't lie, it's the end of the world baby
Can't lie, it's the end of the world baby
Don't lie, it's the end of the world baby
We all know it's the end of the world, baby
What is this world coming to?!

[Verse 2]
The end, and um there ain't no stoppin it
I keep em legit, while others come counterfeit
You can't stand being bankrupt, now ya overdosed
Used to be colors, now they beggin over coats
How you gon come with that nonsense like it's all good?
Tryin to dis a whole coast, can't even go to your own hood
I should get ya, but I'm a chill and let the rhyme hit ya
Keep my name out your mouth, or watch me get wit ya
Some of y'all gots to like hoes, you need to be on stroll
Need to get up, get out, and get a bankroll
Keep em movin like Tony soul, 'cause the game's for sale
You could offer me a million, but I'll never tell
All the money in world could'nt make me sell out a homey
What is a million dollars worth when you're lonely?
You spill the beans me and his dirt (..?..)
So now I gotta ask myself
What is this world coming to?

[Chorus] X 2

[Verse 3]
Couldn't live without a check, please tell me
Four on the floor, one in the belly
You're kinda smelly
Why can't this girl keep her self up, her health up?
When the county stop payin, you gon be stuck like chuck
With five mouths to feed, and you steadily smokin weed
And buying expensive clothes that you don't even need
Still tryin to club it, you can't do that no more
So stretched out, the stretch marks can't even stretch no more
Five different daddies, damn, ain't none of them around
They need to take you off the streets like the (?)
A bad example, how could you bring a kid to this world?
How could you call yourself a woman when you still a girl?
Wonder why they talk bad about ya, it ain't no respect
'cause see you don't respect yourself, you need to get in check
Got evicted out your pad
So now the only thing to do is sell yourself until you pass out
What is this world coming too?

haters allowed so everybody's not invited.  So y'all got to keep y'all 
distance.  Mind your own, you'll live long.  Yeah.  Check me out.

(1st Verse):
These jealous mental cowards got they eyes closed
They didn't see me creeping up from behind they want to be me
But I ain't trippin, sippin on something 90 proof
>From the floor to the roof, I spit this game to youth
By any means, dreams of being a lot more than poor
If you ain't helping your family, then what you living for?
You'd rather talk about the next man, like a busta
Fool, don't make me reach out and touch ya
Then never sleep again, just comprehend, don't playa hate
And real ballers keep their pagers on vibrate
Never try to floss and show off your stacking
On the low, that's if you want to stay away from the popos
Known to attract heat like DeNiro, scandalous federalies 
Got their eyes on the whole state of Cali
You want to be a playa in this game but you gonna watch me win it
Trying to escape reality...in four minutes

(Chorus):
Four minutes of funk-Get off your rump-move your bottom off the tree 
stump-ladies looking pretty, from city to city-and now I'm getting down 
to the nitty gritty.
>From the bottom to the top, top to the bottom, come on Bullet Loc and 
get funky while we got 'em.

(2nd verse):
Gas or cash, ain't no free ride,
Felony got love coming from both sides
About to blow it up and that's on me, Ready to bring it on
Man y'all gon' see, I tell my homie to give me a refill
'Cause I don't give a damn, they got me standing on porkchop hill
With the most of my mind gone, just because a youngsta want to get his 
grind on - Fool kill that!
I'm trying to feed my household, what should I do?
To survive, I got to work for you?
Increase the minumum wage, but you will never make me happy
Huh,but a real nigga keep it nappy, Yeah so I connect
With E-A-Ski for bomb songs, when they hear the record they want to sing 
along, my business straight now the industries about to be dealed
Soon as I hit the world up with four minutes.

(Chorus)

(3rd verse)
And if you ever say you can see me, it don't compute
It's like walking through hell with a gasoline package suit
I'm unfadable with this and about to show ya, time's up,
I'm about to overthrow ya, it was nice to know ya
I'm comin' with it to move 'em all, Never be no coward
Keep hitting your enemy unil they fall y'all
And to my females that's never faking and paper chasing
Time is just too valuable to be wasting
On the independent stroke or with a ?
I'm down with ya, let's put our heads together and now we get richer
We got to get it while it's good to get
Let's put it down, hit em up by surprise and then we leave town
Don't you like the sound of that?  Him skinny and me fat
Count it up and split it 50/50 back at the flat
To the end we represent-we in it to win it
Trying to escape reality in four minutes

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood 
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh 

I got a wicked flow and I'm gonna kick it yo 
Feel the pressure 
Snatching niggas up just like a chain off the dresser 
Niggas hit me with the best shit then what 
I shake that bullshit off then go 
I've been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing 
Y'all niggas is duckin' me like you owe me something 
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say 
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day 
The best way you can hope to get close to me 
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be 
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange 
Best to be ducking range 
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain 
I break niggaz like promises 
Split em' open like Thomas' 
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist 
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime 
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time 

[Chorus]

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood 
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh 
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood

Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show!

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, M-C's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin' M-C's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9nes's vild""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway and Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays

Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'

 So dope they name us all twice like we, pelle pelle
 You better be prepared to call me billy loco gorde
 Pop my collar with none other than earl-40
 Squab on a square like it's high noon, cousin wit tycoons
 If you fuck with sick wid it why'all niggaz gon' die soon
 I can't make a fiend do nuthin against they will
 I just leave they eyes so yellow you see em and yield
 Whoa -- spill the guts of the ones that's not real
 So when you see me nigga scream out one shot kill
 Gotta, spot on my shoe from all the blood we spill
 I get it even if i don't want it nigga like free refill

 Thirty-two shot extended clip to keep it trill when i pop
 Durin the summer it's zenith's but in the winter ?? not
 Better believe us don't try to play us for false
 Cause it's not a game no way no how
 Billy loco, charlie hustle and major payne nigga now
 How you think i was gonna deallllllllll with it?
 Fuck around and wind up gettin killllllllled with it
 Beotch! you booty rappers get penalized, and expedited
 Cause dey don't think about they shit, before they write it
 We don't sell narcotics with the po-po problems, playboy take a look
 We off into real estate, cd's, millions of wealth
 Used to be crooks still hang around crooks, dealers and ex-cons
 Niggaz with luke's and ?? ?? shirt on
 Players with cake, pushin they weight, try to find the last trap
 'fore they bloody wrecked illegal corporate scratch
 What they buck?

 Are why'all fools ready for dis?	it's a loco for sure i'll blast
 With billy loco and 40-water we take your life then we haul ass
 Tall cash stacked in the basement
 Can't leave the house with less than a zip an a extra clip
 Niggaz want to know why i get down like this ain't that a bitch?
 You see my, life on tv cause it's the daddy with the ?? and a p
 Niggaz just can't seem to get away from pd while they surrounded me
 And houndin me cause i ball hard, on parole and a double-are
 Fifty to a hundred g's and je-wels on wrists
 Nigga we ghetto stars
 Shit my niggaz spent g's to push, drop bentleys
 Remi mark sippin, cristal, x-o hennesey
 And better believe when we enemies we spray wit these
 Every night at twelve have your whole motherfuckin city prayin on knees
 And still 40-water pass the strap and i blast, still hit the gas
 Had to tear his whole motherfuckin head off tryin to ?? the stash
 Every man they all man, quick to pull a lick out the brougham
 Only reason i rode down on that bitch ass nigga, is because i can!

Yeah
Yeah

Kid frost

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the x man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some olde english that's covered with frost
And it's like that

[ chorus ]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

{frost}
I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the h-k with the laser
Slid the enterpriser, rent a 99 black blazer
I shot straight at merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the peppermint casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

[ chorus ]

{jayo felony}
I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? that shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

Yeah I been tryin' to slang it, but don't nobody want it
They can't help you with band-aids, we comin' with grenades,
You ain't seen this many niggas in your life with diamonds and braids
I'm from the home where they get sprayed and gang related raids
Fuck y'all, that start bangin' after ""Colors"" was made
Let's C-walk to that, and never give me no hassle
cause I come from one of the worst cottage in Paso

It ain't no mystery you dissin' me you dissin' my clique
And ain't no question we come steppin' straight to get in your shit
So why you actin' like a bitch?  Puttin' your business on wax
When we could scrap or slap a clip, if you wanted to crack
See in the pen we got a name for niggas runnin' they yap
Sale soldiers, roll 'em up with somethin' up in they back
Handles ours, battle scars, Shackles, guards and all
And we the last niggas standin' once they start to fall
Make the call, or fuck it, just kick off the brawl
Cuz I'm ridin' with my doggs, win, lose, or draw
Dogg pound insane, neighborhood twenty gangin' it
And every gangsta that I hang with down to bang
Full time pull mines and I gots to bust
Fuck a pass, when I mash, anybody get touched
So make my name taste just like a dick in your mouth
And watch the way you on my nuts when you spittin' it out
Dogghouse

Any problems any problems you can holla at my dog
Holla, holla
Holla at my dogg, you could holla at my dogg, oh

And my 38. specialist puttin' banker's in they tomb's

Made it out the ghetto, bustin' a male, so I can wet y'all
Took a while 'fore I ball
Wanted for eight or nine murder's and spoke came
For cocaine, raw game, another die for what he claim
And where I'm from they know my name, I 'cause lot's of static
Automatic's and canic's, and nigga's start to panic

Fifteen, sixteen in a chevy we roll
Get you full of hole's, god dog, you scream echo's in fo-fo's
Who dare to mack wit' the tarantula and scorpion
Brought you in the depth's of danger when I tortured it
I love it when the bustaz squealin'

And I'm sniffin' in shit tell the cartilage is gone
I'm the stone cold heavyweight that'll bait you in
Put you down with my team fool, and make you win
I laid the cut with mouth shut forty seven sprayed
Prepare for the outcome and pray for my prey
Then we getting shotty kill a biting nigga with young gotti
Then we eat a pork chop meal and we all dead body

Hang with my crew blue strings in my shoes
Mary Jane and some loop while we swags in the coupe
I'm addicting to smacking hoes
Tracks, flows Crenshaw Boulevard backing foes

L.A.'s Finest and L.A.'s behind us
Gangsta, hoochies, essays and whinnies

Gangsta shit still dropping, Crenshaw still popping

Gang signs throwing up, body's still showing up
And O yea Time Bomb still blowing up, bitch
When you got the L.A confidential up in the place to be
Ride with me

Let's all roll, throw it up if you with me
I'm so cold, who am but staying G
The Dogg Pound stays the learn all y'all heard
Please date me when stick before you get serve

You know gangstas bang and gangsta slang
It's just an gangsta thang
Gangstas dip and some gangstas trip
I'm the gangsta slip and this gangsta crip

I used bump brother with the gangsta nip
'Cause nobody else was on the gangsta tip
Gangstas smoke sh room and gangsta rock perms
Gangstas don't listen and gangstas don't learn

Gangsta rock braids and gangsta jerry curls
Gangsta's going take over the world
Gangsta's go to jail, gangstas skip bail
Gangsta's make mail and gangsta's would never fail

Gangsta's goin' stay on top
Because the gangsta is going to make the gangsta shit pop
Just lounge homeboy you in the gangsta zone
Heart thrown in California where the gangstas roll

Let's all roll, throw it up if you with me
I'm so cold, who am but staying G
The Dogg Pound stays the learn all y'all heard
Please date me when stick before you get serve

My nigga slip is an gangsta
'cause I'm an hood ster, an hood star I'm taking the hood far
The see Riders posted up with the bullet loco blue rags
Smoking the bombing fluid and keep dumping on you fags

I heard and seen it all and I'm hoping you fall
Keep looking at my nuts until I get crip ball
I'm still striving, yeah ya word is about what I'm driving
Your bitch is going me more, pedal to the floor

Fuck an navigator, nigga I can flip ten gators in my living room
If you can't to that nigga give me room
Had an tourney 89' but your bitch made me mine
See the mother fucker ran on that biz state of mind

For mine I did the crime, had to run one time
And you take my dick in your mouth in one time
I fuck you in the butt and crip walk your liver
While I rich roll on the river

Caught up in the land of hard time
Back off mine, I'm mad I'm pushing an hard line
An hard cat with hard raps and hard rhymes
I hardly pay attention to rap

My mine say hard dick serve to an bitch ain't no crime
Hood soft to hard dime, chicken way I flip mine
Hard hit and rip like canines, hit hard heads with no spine
March and start to take mine

Big D let me fuck that bitch and you fuck mine
Off hard liqueurs is harder than wine Knoc-Turnal comes through overtime
When I die build me an shrine all is all is getting in my mind
I ain't begun to speak yet, until that time

Let 'em know, out in the west represent let it gold
Let's throw it up, throw it up

And the police ain't fucking with me knock on wood
Or my shoes cause he blew my socks so good
Dope shot never knew I'd shoot my glock so good
I'm walk like coke and that's all they wanna hit
And they just can't do but they all wanna spit

Losin' your fuckin' mind
Stayin' out too many days at a time
Yeah

I'm starin' down a dark tunnel and I can't see the light
Rats crawlin' everywhere, you know how they be at night
I got a gun in my hand, and I gotta squeeze it tight
I'm tryin' to get out of here, no one said it's easy right?
My stomach is queasy like, I got a fuckin' lump in my throat
More than a decade, I'm searchin' and I'm huntin' for hope
Soakin' in alcohol, smokin' usin' somethin' to cope
But how much water can you bail from your boat, 'fore it sinks?
My hijinks, made my eyes chink, pink from the lye stink
Pockets broke made want to rob things
Fuck this rap shit! My city's full of suicide kings
So from here on, this is now a do or die thing

I got a baby on the way, mad bills to pay
But I took too many God damn pills today
And I can't get out of this haze, out of my bed
Can't get these sick thoughts outta my head, I'm goin' crazy

I don't wanna talk shit, but this weed in my pocket
Is makin' me crazy, just get me a straight-jacket and lock it
I'm fueled like a rocket, the topic of conversation
Is I'm a little +Insane in the Brain+, and I can spark it
Like a suicide bomber, homey I'm ready to bomb it
Adrenaline takin' over, think I'm gonna vomit
But I can promise you one thing, I walk it like I talk it
If I shoot a comet at you better hope that you can duck it
Fuck it, I'm annoyed with some of these shitty rappers
Tryin' to turn the fuckin' lights out just call me The Clapper
Cause homeboy is a poser, takin' it so far
I put you on the corner where most of my hoes are, and

You can make money for daddy, just don't be mad at me
But this is what happens any time you throw a jab at me
You can take a stab at me, and really get peeled maybe
It's time to put you away, homey I'm still crazy

Lord forgive me I'm surrounded by sin, insects crawlin' under my skin
Demons knockin' at the door of my mind, I feel like lettin' 'em in
What you call drug dependency. I call settin' a trend
I was always into drugs, just nobody caught me
I learned it from the best teachers, my family taught me
I got knocked went to trial, guess what that bought me?
The aura of invincibility, you can't stop me
My great grandfather was a doctor, his son was a doctor
Soon as I found pussy, I wanted to play doctor
In my middle school locker I had a bottle of vodka
Took a shot at lunchtime, sprayed my breath with Binaca
I'm no psycho, my sheet says I'm a sociopath
I enjoy prescription pills and blowin' that grass
What you callin' big cash, I would throw in the stash
That weed you saying's exotic I throw in the trash

I got nothin' to live for except a 40 cal slug
Waitin' up in the barrel I can take it in the mug

You know my steelo, army fatigue
Timberland boots, don't let me intrigue
But I gotta smoke a blunt with you
Straight up and down, play the front with you
I just want to stunt with you, 'cause you my fly boo
Yeah, you know how we do

[Lounge Mode]
""With you, with you"" (baby girl, come walk with me, man)
""With you, with you"" (let's go over here, youknowhatimean, to the bodega)
""Said I'm ready now, oh"" (let me get a Dutch, and a good wrap
It's so necessary, man, so we can just swing one, you know, yo)

[Lounge Mode]
Yo, what's the deal gorgeous?
I can't hit you on your Sprint cordless?
And one day, talk about it over food orders
I'm Lounge Lo, where you from, how I figured out
It's all good, what's your name? I want to dig you out
And make you something, get dough and break you something
Spend time, plus dine at the lake or something
Have sex foreplay, and watch a tape or something
Yeah baby, let's get it on, the wave is nothing
Wild style thug, still run with an eight
Got a chick now, gettin' it crunk fifth in the waist
And she dealin' with a cat like me exactly
Like, givin' love names and callin' me Blacky
I said, that's my girl, that's my twenty two
Its all love, so the hell what the money do
That's my girl, that's my twenty two
Its all love so the hell, what the money do, stupid

""With you, with you""

What's your name, do you drink champagne?
Do you smoke a little weed? Do you pop ecstasy?
Do you got seeds? It's all gravy
This the baby daddy, huh, give me a kiss

[Jaysaun]
You better join us, 'cause you can't beat us
With professional cheaters, who clutch chrome heaters
Under wife beaters, at Club Cheetah's, so nice to meet us
In them Daisy Duke shorts, no Boss Hog and no Cletus
Love look fierce, three karats in their ears
Gold stud in the bottom lip, and diamonds in her tongue pierce
Shook what her mama gave her, a Playboy bunny
And plus she tail links with a major player
And that's nothing but scandal, and hot wax
Drippin' on your back, incense smoke and mad candles
Body paints, graffiti on your flesh, spray painted on the walls like vandals
She say Jaysaun, so kinky, bright glow on her pinky toe
Green so sticky, the way I'm handlin' mines
Ought to be a crime, last word bitch
Seek and you'll find, we get it

X-ray vision, when I size niggas up
See two wheels fall off, when I ride nigga what

Two pigeons on the dashboard, snub in the spot

From corners we educated, so hatas get confiscated
Rated by these pit bulls, and these untamed guerillas
Mic wreckers and head bustas, we owe ya then we gon get ya
So niggas better get the picture, if not then you long gone
Throw your motherfucking set up, 'fore you get your chest gone

Made to the back, it ain't time no for the champ 'plexing
I grab for the gut, tell everybody be dropping flat
And ducking from the S.L.A.B.er, wood grain when I grab a
Drop it trunk knocker, on choppas looking for boppers

Ducking hood shots, and bob and weaving the hood spots

Never knew nothing to me, cause I'm too thoed for them rookies
Look the streets made me, streets love me and streets hate me
So the streets pay me, motherfucker it's all gravy
Want it all baby, never gon let the money change me
Only thing that may change, the way I just done roll updated
Got a large family, it's a bunch of us need to be happy
Them hood daddies, on the grind and making me happy

Scared took him out of the hotel, 'cause when Ro swang Ro swell
Eyebrows and jaws, so in my presence Mr. don't tell
I'm a motherfucking murderer, you the wanksta
Popping that gangsta shit on the radio, and it's disturbing you
Big Moe nigga that's my big dog, and my love ain't never gon withdrawal
So we clicked up coming to get why'all, my nigga Ja said you's a bitch dog

Mob figgas representing, and we here to do the job
Got my step-on nigga shoes on, 'case it get dirty
'Cause man it's going down, in the Thirty
It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B
Black H2 Hummers, when we holding the Avenue
Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap
Nigga they call me hit man, don't get your wig pushed back
Man some of these niggaz, is bitches too
Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you
Archie Lee been real, before I had a crew
Get it right don't get it wrong, I stay's in the zone
Plus my piece got yellow stones, like I stayed on the Stone
I spit that hood shit, that wood shit
Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you
Niggaz getting ran over, in a Rover
Trae forever staying sober, like a Jehovah
Witness I'm at your door brah, door brah

Let's take it, to the streets
Any one of you, motherfuckers got beef
I will fill you, with heat
Get the nine millimeter fitted up in my denim, on my creep
Who that want to do that, bitch or come through that
And sweep up, that street
I'm a motherfucking G, and bitch you gon' listen to me
When I speak, ain't got no time to try to be friendly
Motherfuckers, must didn't hear me
Move around bitch, before you feel me
We smoke em, and choke em
Then fry a motherfucker, just like a poker
The game is now over, be the next
To the thoedest cats or now open, are you playing with me boy
Watch a nigga bob and weave, and then we break jaw
We ain't barring no law
Snap rugged and rough, and playing this game raw
Bitch we ready for war, anybody running up is bound to get scarred
D-O-you-G I are, dropping bombs up on you bitches going hard

Sweet pea ass nigga, fuck around and catch the heat ass nigga
Beefing with me a nigga named be	, you silly rabbits finna see
A guerilla thriller will kill a nigga, in these H-Town streets
Ready for war boy we raw, I thought I told you cats
Who was the nigga that had to bust, and make the crowd move back
Never slacking or lacking, still attacking like I'm Sadaam
Set it off like the chirp that's going off, on the alarm
Doing harm nigga we swarm, on any and every hater in sight
Fuck around and call a nigga Teddy, steady turning off your lights
Night lights gon get burned, fucking with paper that I earned
S.L.A.B. gladiating on hating, see you cats gon learn

It's Jay'Ton, motherfuckers and if they don't know the name
From the wild wild West, slugging em like Jesse James
Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't want to get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

S-L-A-be	, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck
I'm a cold blooded killa, do a murder for the price
So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

I didn't wanna but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

I bust the windows out ya car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark

I bust the windows out ya car
You should feel lucky that that's all I did

Gave you all of me and you played with it

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it

I'd rather it be with you
Cause at least there will be
Sweet memories

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears (oh my)
But I'm scared of (loving you)
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair (that's right)
But I'm scared of (loving you)

Jazmine Sullivan,"How you goin' do that to me? (sigh)
I can't believe this

I wish I never ever got drunk that night
Made me foolish enough to come to your crib
Walked up the stairs and then I turned on the lights
Couldn't even speak because it happened so quick
I wish I never saw your punk ass that night
You always seem to calm me down with your lies
Even though I know better I try and I try
But you always have the perfect alibi

If a lie goin' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth goin' make me cry
I rather just live a lie

If a lie goin' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth goin' make me cry
I rather just live a lie

I wish I never ever saw you that night
Rite now I'd still be thinking we were OK
I called you just before I got on my flight
I say 'I love you', And you tell me the same
If I could go back in time
I never would of called your phone up
Never would of dialed your number
Never would of gotten that drunk
If I could go back in time
I never would of gotten that tore
Never would of asked for one more
Never would of walked through your door

If a lie goin' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth goin' make me cry
I rather just live a lie

If a lie goin' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth goin' make me cry
I rather just live a lie

Easier to live
Like you don't see nothing
Even tho it ain't rite
Harder to turn over in your bed and he ain't by your side
I think if I didn't walk in that night
And see you with my own eyes
I would still be living a lie

Just gotta know
Whatever you do
It's goin' come back to you
I cant' believe this

I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit
Maintain 'til it surface
The nerve of these peasants
Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it
Think they get the message
Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressing
Negative energy
Generated from the snakes and the centipedes
You will remember me
I just get the storm started
Cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way you on target
Move to the side, let the lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight
Yeah!
American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand
This is Mafia, veterans'll plan
Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw
I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip
The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks
Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is
It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke
Chirp, yo, Chirp back
Let me know who getting murked, though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga
Who getting work, though
And I got the Kush, nigga
I got the Purple, move squares
'Cause we got a hold on the circle
Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue
Beat you like ya parents when you breaking your curfew

(Chorus)
Homie, live life to the death
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step

Yo, living my life, what's left of it
Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it
If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate
It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga
Death's a definite
This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it
Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless
Gun play make you do whatever son say
If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way
Put that work in when you young, you get power
The money don't match the running it get sour
Still rep the hood to the death
A promise is only good if it's kept
Niggas'll kill you for less
Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing
The window of opportunity keeps closing
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller
Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit
That's street shit, Jada & P shit
Lambos, hoopties, shooters and groupies
Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci
Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous
Court shit, gave them Jews money for Porsches
Made a couple mil for the small shit
We rap and keep raw, so we on some street lore-Forbes shit
Wall still spin, upgraded the floor flip
Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it
If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about
Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it
Leave some blood up in it
Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast
The seats is like butter in it
No hammers in the club, box cutter in it
Long money and big checks
Get popped in the chest, face, wig, neck
Tre Pound, Sig, Tec
Play the game, get a plane is ya ship wreck
Learn from the best if you ain't learn shit yet
Yeah! Muthafucka

(Chorus)
Homie, live life to the death
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step

I ain't care he was old enough to be my father
I knew his wife I went to school with his daughter
He was the boss that I knew went harder
Gave me my first taste but I had to take it farther
I mean I had to go harder

I started calling up his crib just to hit him
And I ain't even care I ask his wife if she was with him
Came home late and he got into a fight,
And he called me that night
He said he never want to see me on the block
I said I don't need you but I need that rock

I couldn't take it so I had to go see him
Stole my mama car and drove around all evening
And when I found him I thought that he would lace me
I ain't got no money but you know I'll let you taste me
He pulled his gun out and told me I was stupid
I started crying prayed to God he wouldn't do it

[Chorus]
Oh please, Lord I plead, just save me (if you're really there)
Here's a sinner's prayer
This is my redemption song

I met this chick in Philly who said she like to sing
I ain't mean it but I said that it was good she had a dream
My daddy used to beat my mama
Saw it everyday
So when I got wit' her, I did the same thang
He always used to say you gotta keep a bitch tamed
So I never let her sing

And every chance I got I told her if she ever left me
I'd kill her that's is how I made her respect me
Forget me, never, made her believe it don't get no better

I told her it was crazy out there
She said she don't care but she can't stay here

The last time I hit her she went into the kitchen
I ain't pay her no mind or even know that she was missing
She came out bleeding with her eyes all blacked
I looked and saw she had something behind her back
She pulled the gun out and told me I was stupid
Dropped to my knees and prayed to God she wouldn't do it

[Chorus]

I really need to know if you are there
If you could just, just heal a sinner's prayer
You could remake me
Oh just save me
I promise if you get me through this I'll change
I need to be set free

I can help you, ship them the next thing in the morning.
So I guess this is finished,
I guess you're the one, who send it,
This should be no reason you should ever do my
You should never have to call me up pretending,
Cause baby I know you're pretending!
Listen I don't wanna fight cause it ain't the point,
It's sad that you called just to hear my voice,
You should have known I was gone,
When I busted your window down!
Cause you won't say it, but I know that you need me baby,
And I'm glad I can say it I don't need you baby!
I did my part, you broke my heart,
But I won't make the same mistakes again!

I ain't gonna lie,
I think about if we could try it make it work one more time,
Could we do it?
Could we do it again, babe?

Take away my fame take away my dough

So many things I never fell in no one else

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Robins building nests from coast to coast;

In the ""tender passion"" they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,

We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of son,
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!

""sulfur and molasses"" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,

And I'm prayin' for the black girls
Who went missing and missed Christmas
Now listen, what would you rather?
Doin' the best or doin' it different
I got sick of the dream, spoke it into existence
Turned it out with a dollar then I turned that to a million
Black angel been through hell and back
Now they made me the villain
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
I learned a lot about my early twenties
Lookin' back a nigga wasn't ready
When it came to friends I had way too many
A lot flaked when the shit got heavy
And a lot of times, I was more focused on dollar signs
I had to put it in overdrive, caught myself callin' so many lies
Argued instead of apologized
I wasn't ready to compromise
Many mistakes were ill-advised
Had to cut it out, started cutting ties
I must've fucked up a hundred times
Blamin' the liquor to justify
Everything that wasn't right in my broken life
That's Fleurever

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

They live only for the dream of living so come follow where they will take you there.

I once was apprenticed to a man who was living
In the eye if the hurricane to know despair,

He knew all the dreams by heart just like sailing in a boat of
crystal silence seeing visions of the world of life within a life.

In a turning like a burning came turning 
Out of everything stirring and what had begun before

But all wrapped up in one great godly becoming -
Tumbling and fumbling and stumbling
Into bumbling and rumbling along -

Whirling it and swirling it and twirling it and hurling it 
And overturning it and burning it again.

I shared a whirling dervish out on the side of a hill called metaphor vivace
Swinging en route to a nascent solar with the scissored visored blizzard wizard 
Gizzarding planets and secrets within like an avatar.

While meanwhile in turn styling and spinning over him
Spells bespeaking kingdoms in the dark

Calling me to yield knighting me in a field covered with armies
And with princes. All were signing cannons shining pennants flying.

And when he spoke to me he sang and his words really rang -
This child of the knowledge of the beauty of the night -

He sang to me of masters passing on of father after father after father
Climbing up into the lotus bloom upon the tortoise's back

And of grandfathers who danced through their living a longer time ago.
He showed me a palace in time in which all the talismans
From all the zeuses swing upon a pendulum of secrets
In a circle that remembers and when asked a question will surren",Night Dreamer,1998

Jazzanova,"Wasn't so long ago
I had given up all my hope
Convinced that love was a game for fools
People just changing up all the rules
Kept my heart under lock and key
Seemed like the safest place to be

Then you stepped to me all on the fly
I saw the future in yours eyes

And you made me
Made me a believe
Made me a believer

Must have sensed my pain of heard my plea
Like an angel sent straight here to me
And I hope and pray everyday
I will always feel this way
Now my karma must have been in check
You'r much much more than I'd expect
From a world I thought was full of deceit
You turned all around for me

And you made me
Made me a believe
Made me a believer

I'll tell the world I'll tell my friends
Never give up on love again
Sometimes it's there in front of you
Yet all you see is a smoke filled room
So take a chance and step on in
You won't know til you begin
To put your faith on higher ground
Were love is lost it can be found",Believer,2012

Something that I can't explain, yeah yeah

I can't explain
Oh no ooh
Hey, yeah

Before the night is over
I wanna shake the question
I wanna leave it for now
Without another mention
We should be letting go
Instead of holding on
But in the eye in my mind
The mystery is born

No use in looking further
You know it isn't there
And you can stare all you want
The answers won't appear
Try to find it but I lose myself
I lose myself in you

Jazze Pha,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

[Chorus]
(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Quit the flow, don't even ask, then go on with it
Nasty attitude so you know you can't hit it

Just forget it, I got my mind on my shine
Labeled most hated bitch in 1999
Now it's 2-G, got hoes scared to drop they shit
I'll put my foot off in yo ass and I'll stomp that shit
Lock that shit, hit the spot and rock that shit

I'm on a mission and you wishin' you could stop my shit
My momma told me, ""Whatever you do, stack the dough""
Don't ever fall behind no playa hatin' hoe

You niggas must be blind
Or that hoe must got yo' mind, your mind

She was looking kinda classy in the back of the club
Baby kept eyein' me, loving the stud
Teasing and trying me while I'm sitting there stuff
Quiet like jockin' me, all on my nuts
Til my focus got sloppy, spilling this cup
Went way up out of his mind and started touching her butt
That's premature macking nigga you're fucking off my action
Nigga you Captain Save-a-Hoe (bitch) action packed nigga

You was young and foolish (young and foolish)
Didn't know what you was doing (what you was doing)
Didn't really know she was a hoe, oh no (a hoe!)

Drove you wild (drove you wild)
I bet you want that hoe to have your child (yo' child)

Yeah, uh-huh
I don't respect no dick-sucking freak in the pack
Most niggas claim pimping but that shit be a act
I ain't got nothing for you hoe
You ain't got to spend the night, you can get your shit and go
I'm not no sugar daddy hoe one-stop
Top notch hoes even got to have they own knot
I seen niggas get caught up, right quick
I seen hoes capitalize, and hit licks
I wonder what the fuck be wrong with these tricks
So me and 40 singing this song for these tricks
You know them niggas who call them hoes all day
At the hoe job all in the hoe face
As soon as the hoe tip off and get tipsy
She got dick on her lips, up in the Embassy
And be home before four, snuggled up with you 
Wake up and pretend to make love with you

A polygamist means having, forty-one broads
I'ma tell you what's real pimping, I'ma tell you straight up true
I'ma keep it real with you pumping, I promise you I got you
She was off in the vocal booth, talking about I'll do you wrong
Some of that genocide and juice, then the thing about the thong
Fantasizin about sex in groups, nothing small
She like niggas that like to shop at the, big and tall

Better talk about, might like what you hear
Say it right in her ear, every night of the year

Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wasting this girl time
I'm running from relationships, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's, way too much fo me
Usually I can take'em and make'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryin' to act now, I'm being real with you
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill with you
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A player like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thing bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo perception on me, I don't think I can maintain
We flirting with disaster, this game we playing is dangerous

I like you to pursue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but til then be friends and nothing mo
Even though another time, another life, anotha place
I swear I know we could of been great
But rather than great, you lil' heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you right, I'm willing ta wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny coming from a felon
But I think I got a piece of was up in heaven
So to keep from, blocking mah blessings, think I better back up
Last thing a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballas tell me you ain't worth it

Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
Wanna ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it that's a lie
You just scared to get this Penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye When I walked by
I said, ""Hi""
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange

You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang

Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it’s a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange

You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang

Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said ""take it"" so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn
You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang",Fair Xchange [Jazze Pha Remix],2002
Jazze Pha,"There you go, 
Acting like a hoe

I don't know why I'll be fucking with you

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby, and there you go

There you go, actin' like a hoe
There you there you go, actin' like a hoe

Hoe! Now I found out for myself you're a
Hoe! Girl you need to check yourself

These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin' hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin' too much
When she be dyin' to fuck me you be buyin' her stuff, hoe

See girlfriend I know, your whole M.M.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20 it ain't Outhin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe? but there you go

Uhh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she, callin' me flippin' like she miss me all the time
How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin' dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like, damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty, and stop callin' while I'm workin' you hurtin' me
All this bullshit is irkin' me girl, but there you go

I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
'Cause there you go, just like a hoe, caught in the streets
Like givin' yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin', so stop playin'(hoe)
You hear what I'm sayin, you only good for parlayin'
I'm layin' down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby 'cause I stay on the move

Oh, so yo' friend wanted to go out
That wasn't you that went out

Jazze Pha,"Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile
To my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed, you got me
Inhalin' the aroma of your perfume, and feelin' heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin'
My lyrics are poetry
So baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction, see pictures of us
Layin' butt-naked on the beach kickin' back relaxin'
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I want to make you mine
I'm kissin' on you tryin' to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin' at the walls
With your number in my hand, wonderin' should I even call her tonight

Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me

Been gettin nothin' but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us havin' breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide, it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin' love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin'
Come get a shot of this plain dealin' and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, 'cause every time we touch
It's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin' my fingers through your hair if you call me

Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me

Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby 'cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
'Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the hot', if it feel right
My only wish is to be with you
You got me steady strivin' to get you
Fantasizin' of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin' major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin' wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places, what will it take
'Cause the heartache be heatbreak, is my prediction
When you falsify and start fake, in my position
I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?

Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you

Baby call on me",U Can Call [Jazze Pha Remix],2002
Jazze Pha,"Shit, I'm a changed man, ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw

Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M O B

And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?

So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin'

I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin' past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat

Don't creep, oh what you think, T I P and them sweet?
Don't sleep, get you hit from your head to your feet
And you don't know me, I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload

You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neck piece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Your fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out “M O B”
Nigga we ride

I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number 1 in the nation, I fucked the world
The Judge gave me probation, faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to, the whole nation

Gimme nine, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz and fuck a bitch
'Cause a true sister love niggaz

Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke on Death Row
My adversaries bleed but fuck 'em all
'Til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

Everybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man

Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape

[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[T.I. and studio engineers interlude convo]

[Verse Four: T.I.]
Open my eyes, see the sunrise
Talkin about memories of G's got my tongue tied
Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

[Outro: Kalage]
All I know
Is I'd been down this road before
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray",All I Know,2002

Another day on the grind, it ain't much to do
Fuck with some bitches, hit a couple switches
This nigga's talkin' shit, I had to bomb on him
Had to get checked, niggaz best respect

Everyday you see me on the paper chase
I'm G, Warren to the G you know me
Throw your hands high, where all my G's at?
They all comin', to where Warren G's at

I keep my game tight, money and money and mo' money
And ain't a damn thing funny
How could I live like that? I just can
And when it comes to this game, I'm just too far advanced

I'll leave you waiting, homey what's crackulating
Is it cracking or not? In the back of the lot?
But this is all I got, I thought it was known
Warren G, Neb Luv, K-Bar and it's on

I'll drive ya crazy, pull your car for the diamonds
I'm gettin' shady, swayzie in the plush

Too quick to be touched, give you the head rush
To the front of the stage, like you bout to get paid
I'm lights, camera, watch you blow like grenades
I never serenade, I just party

Marinate, get your cash everybody
Come on and ride with me, dip with me
Get rich with me, sip some Hennessey

I'm a pass on this million dollar hustle, you a fool now
Give me some portraits of some dead niggaz
Take two shots of the best made nigga

These niggaz, talkin' too much, they flossin' too much
Instead of makin' they bucks, bank account runnin' out of luck
Now you stuck, do deals fulfill your dreams make cream
Keep my pockets long like streams, no strings

Attached, attack any nigga plottin' on my stack
Mo bounce to this, smoke an ounce to this
Make more gold than fish, one wish
Live on top of the world

And better livin' for ghetto boys and girls
Peanuts is for the squirrels

My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin through my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?)
No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Heeeyy man!)
All play flirtin all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back porch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared up, but what was we afraid for?
Look what we made of, heart that what made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we won't fall!

Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred-spokes
Skullied on that front porch, plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 headin down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anything and everything
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

I might, hop off the Harley, spoke mine like Bob Marley
Not parties with charties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophit gotta like them
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin with them!

[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
I roll through your city they go who is that, 
In a brand new Baby Blue Cadillac, 
Truck two days old, with remote controls, 
Press the motherfucking' button and the TV's fold,
Out the top of the dash, shaking they ass,
Tuck a lil' something and I show her some cash,
I'm Mannie Fresh hoe, represent the ""S"",
Cash Money Records nigga nothing but the best,
Got a monster truck, sitting on 30's,
Fuck the rap game 'cause I still push birdies,
I'm hood rich bitch, you know who I are,
They don't want to fuck me they want to fuck my car,
Now wait a minute hold up mane get it straight, 
Ya dude push pebbles birdman push weight,
And its so incredible the things he does,
Take a project bitch from where she was, 
Clean her life up, wife her just because, 
We some motherfucking pimps you bitch,

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2: Baby]
Blastin' rounds when we moving these pounds, 
Counting cash out a shoe box, we getting it down,
I'm holding my town, like a nigga on a mound,
Or a crab out the bucket when me moving around
I'm strong in the hood, steering wheel all wood,
In the back of the lac the nigga played all good,
I'm on my grizzy my nizzy to get this brand new crib,
Behind this money its goin' be a fucking killin'
I'm moving around uptown this how its going down,
I'm coming through the hood for a billi killin' bitch,
Money is a must, hanging out at the club with hoes on motorbikes my nigga,
That ghetto life, with these calls and brawls it ain't no love in my eyesight nigga
A million in cash in the back of the dash and I'm the OG driving my nigga,

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
Yeah, got my root beer dickies on,
With my motherfucking diamond studded cell phone,
I got cars to match these clothes, with some ignorant ass banged out project hoes,
I'm dope boy fresh, I mean that bitch,
that's gators on my waiter when he serving that shit,
And I'm coming through your hood, disrespecting y'all,
Bass turned up loud knocking pictures off the wall,

[Verse 4: Baby]
I'm riding gangster in a green Mercedes,
throwing spinach out the window Mannie fresh and Baby,
Icy whips with the gun on my hip,
Bootin' up at you bitches like ""fuck yall haters"" (fuck yall haters)
So get straight or get this gun in your face,
And fuck around and be a whole 'nother killing,
In the sky blue Bentley, 23's they spinnin',

Forever my lady ?, bitch I ain't Jodeci,
If fucking you is wrong, I don't want to be right,
Your mouthing feel good and your pussy is tight,
But you gotta understand I could never be your man,
Put ya ring back on bitch, you ain't stan,
You wanna know the real, I tell you how I feel,
I don't give a fuck about a bitch I'm trying to make a bill,

Fuck what you talking bout, life ain't fair,
Hoes don't help, they just spend your wealth,
Then they gone in the wind when you lone and help,

Gone from home, like you been out tourin,
Think who you with, bitch get off my dick,

Bitch get on your hustle, let me see your muscle,

Throw your hands up if you feel me! Throw your hands up if you feel me!

Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status, so I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches want to get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style
These bitches calling, asking where the after party
The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darling
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

Before you get to me
The bitch, and she a G and said ""what's up for later?""
I said ""I'm 20 East, I'm headed to Decatur""
And motherfuck the hater
It's about this making paper
And while she choosing hard, guaranteed I'ma take her
So shake the saltshaker, the dro' is the vapor
I ain't got love for niggaz cause all they try to do is cake her
I ain't sippin on no chaser, that's what we tell the waiter
You goddamn right, I'm a motherfucker player
So tell me how you want it

[Don P]
Just up off the pill, drinking on my beer
Sitting on a mill, but I'm pimpin still
Riding round the track, like Goldie in the Mack
Still I'm Don Coreleone pimping hoes from my realm
Mesmerized by the words coming out my mouth
So I'm flushing money quickly out these bitches' bank accounts
After that I bounce
To another ho, in a totally different city
for a whole other show
They say, ""why you don't call?"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You always out of town"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You probably in the club"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
You bout to make me break your neck, I have to ask your ass again

Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick,
Feelin' fucked up, flicked out, freaked on,
Thinkin' about my new truck with the deep dish,
Meanin' deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome,
After a massage and a ménage, we got in the shower,
Let water trickle down the crack of the back of they booty,
Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom,
One put on Prada, one put on Ludi, I put on Gucci,
Duty calls, I'm bout to hit the scene and ball,
But before I leave I spray on some Itsimiaki,
Take my truck up to the wash, put the sparkle back on,
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miagi,
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak,
So I can sip some while I split one,
Chronicle enter ever pholical of my body,
Calmin' down every molecule, makin' sure I don't trip none,
Hit one
Hop in the ride, come and kick it wit me,
So I can take you through the so-and-so hundred block,
And show you how my people be kickin' it in the windy city,
I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch,
While we sit on leather grippin' wood,
Where the hustla's got packs and the G's got stacks,
And the pimps got lacks, rollin' through the hood,
And it feels so good

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good)

Now I done seen plenty niggas flip twenty's, flip twenty one's,
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours,
Mega ballin', new clothes,
Momma got a new store, TV screens, hundred-forty spokes,
And we fittina' roll, right off Madison to the manor in a drop-top Lexus,
Sippin' henny rollin' reckless, 
Feelin' so motherfuckin' good I could roll my vehicle to Texas,
And spit it like, this is for the syrup sipper's
Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make the words figure,
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand,
When it come to spittin' rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfuckin' man
Get the love, when I hit the club gotta freak in, 
It's the weekend and the DJ bumpin' tattoo,
Track move like some southern, black blues, or like the Cooper, got cruise,
And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be the hottest rap
Dude, ride to this while you peel, yo, hood,
You could go around the block or travel the whole world, 
When you come back it's still yo hood,
And it feels so good

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good)

I spit some game wit the intellect, 
To the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica,
Come and take over the world wit' me girl, 
If you good I might can see if I can be yo manager,
Get yo career on track and yo life on point and I'll show you how yo taxes go
Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, 
Smokin' on some fire, galactic dro,
I know it's good when you smoke that fire, 
Puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick,
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley car, 
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley crib,
Pop that ass, throw that dick, 
Twork that thing, bust that nut,
Drop that top, turn the base up, 
Put you a chameleon paint on the truck,
Get iced up, bumpin' Twista grooves as I cruise new shoes rollin' smooth up in K-Town,
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues, 
If you snooze you lose don't pay dues for the
Tre-pound,
Take tha time to kick wit' yo home girls
And feel yo' nugz
Keep on hatin' on the L, 
Big family we gon' steady come up and I'm a still smoke good,
And it feels so good

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good)

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,

I'm way more fly than you
(That's right)
I'll take your dime from you
(That's right)
Now she want to spend all night with me
(She want to wake up with Weezy-F baby)
Let me be the one that you throw it to, baby
(Throw it back ma, throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)
I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
(Yea so how bout you, so how bout you)

I'll take your bitch give her back, take your bitch again
Because you throw a five I pitch a ten
Now she want to get inside of my sixty six
She sees my wrist blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick (me)
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip (yup)
And I don't lie I confess, 
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though, 
Gotta stay clean, plus momma in a Lex four
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death
It's the bird man Jr. sincerely yours
When it rains it pours, when it rains it whores

And not a day go by us, 
We don't get higher than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone off we ridin'
Where phones don't roam they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleepin' in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds 
We can stare at the morning (yup)
But I can't be there all morning 
I'm a pimp, baby girl, I'm going, going, gone

I'm sorry I was grooving
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music
But let's get back to what we was doing
Laid back in that black on Pat Ewing's
That's thirty three V tires, he fire
These streets ain't papaya ma
You gotta keep heat on your side
Two must, so I'm a get three more and cop you one
Wait, naw hun cause you ain't exempt
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip (yea)
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip
And you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script (yup)
I said I stick to my grip, 
I stick to my money, 
That's life to me
Sorry honey Jazze

So how bout you?
See what I'm talking bout sweet heart 
You ain't even gotta have John Madden
You ain't gotta have Dick Vitale, 
You ain't gotta Lee Carsole
You ain't gotta have Stuart Scott, 
You ain't gotta have Linda Cohn
Know what I'm talking bout, 
You ain't gotta have the staff of E-S-P-N
You ain't gotta have ABC staff just to talk sports baby 
Cause I got game sweetheart
Just fuck with the boy and I'll get you a jersey
What you want me to put on the back
Daddy's little that's right, 
See what I'm talking bout
I can't give you the game

Greasin my strap, kissin my neck baby I'm lovin that
I got this thang that I do with my tongue
I want to do it to you, but it might make you cum
But it'll cure you of your back spasms
Have you floatin while your motion in your ocean gotcha backpedallin
And we can take it to another level
And get elevated, gettin way mo' creative
And you can slap me if it makes you happy
But if you scratch and bite me, that only shows me you like me
See, we can do big thangs
I make you scream my name and blame it all on the whip cream
And if you're down with me, I'll have you down and dirty

I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, what you know about that?
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman and Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But then real close by, niggaz better know that

I ain't hangin' with my niggas, pullin' no triggas
I'll be back to the trap, but for now

I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig

This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's
With my hottie, takin' shots of ? in the Hummer
Known to kick it like we riches, got Richie and Madonna

Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner
Check into the W, so I can put it on her
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger

She the type to keep a nigga open
I'm chillin' with my bitch today

Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone
My partners don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on man
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world
Just a bottle and this ZO. dro, blowin' with my girl

I can tell she a pro. She must have had a lot of practice
Kept her back on the mattress. Either I'm fuckin her good, or she's a damn good actress

This - is a Jazze Phazelle, Slim Thugga
Slim Thug! Collaborinzale!
Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!

It's such an incredible feeling
In this past year I done made a few million
I tried to hide it, but ain't no concealing
Stacking my paper, up to the ceiling
(I pimp) pimping since pimping been pimping
Macking since macking been macking
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen (I pimp)
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen
Y'all niggaz talking, but me and my niggaz make it happen

Slim having major change man, and it ain't no secret
With them diamonds chains and rings, it ain't hard to peep it
You can catch me in the shopping mall, ridiculous bash
Check my restroom trash, all I do is pop tags (pop tags)
And drop rags off of show room floors
Fa sho, I change loads like ho's change clothes
The whole industry knows, how we roll down in texas
Phantom Rolls on 24s, rose gold diamond necklace
Slim shows and tell, so these ho's know me well
I been closing candy doors since Pac was in jail
Hell, I can't complain it's a beautiful feeling
From being broke on ya ass to having cash to the ceiling

I was a mill plus before this record deal stuff
You niggaz talking but we walking shit, for real wit us
They think we country and ain't up on game
Until they see them different colors in the Boss Hogg chain
Or the blue spray Bentley valeted outside of the club
Is that 50 or Jay-Z? naw baby it's Thug
And I ain't playing in no league, or on teams with Steve
I ain't get this from no settlement that I didn't receive
Please believe, the world ain't seen too many me's
I don't think the lord created a lot of these G's
Cause these days I just sit back enjoying the feeling
I was broke on my ass now my cash to the ceiling

Pimping ain't dead! these ho's just scared!
You see it everywhere, but it starts in ya head
Next comes the bread, shit's sweet like Jiffy
Used to do beats for a G, but now a nigga get fifty
It's my time to shine, hard times behind me (bling!)
Forty gold and platinum plaques! and still climbing
And if I lose money, then the paper come find me
Said I was through with rapping, till Sho Nuff signed me
Thank God for the change, cause errbody ain't able
Made a mill slanging beats, that's not including my label

I got a dollar worth of dimes in my stable",Incredible Feelin',2005

I grab the baby powder, under shirt and white tee
My Dickies, fitted cap and white one's that's me
A hundred karats worth of rocks, courtesy of Johnny

Ready to get my stunt on, my pockets on swoll
Now all I gotta do, is see which car I'm finna roll
Now I can take the Benz, or I can take the Rover
And if I pull the Bentley Coupe out, then it's over
But I'mma keep it O-G, and pull out the slab
So I can sit on buck, and have some wood grain to grab
Last but not least, before I pull out on the scene

We bout getting this money, like some real G's should
And we ain't knocking nobody's hustle, why plex man

Now we just wanna shine, buy some bottles and pop em
So if you see niggas out there, playa hating then stop em

Y'all niggas make me sick, spendin' chips on a hoe
On the grind, try'na get it, I shit on a hoe
Off top, let 'em know, I'ma mack, I'ma pro
Matter fact, lemme hit it from the back later on
Baby, gon' bend it over, tune it up let me see
I ain't from Houston hoe, but I'm still a pimp, see?
All I drink is Hennessey, all I smoke is stickery
Hoes wanna get with me, but they ain't get shit for free
I'ma playa, you can tell, ATL where I live
I ain't with the kissin', hoes, Jazze Fizzle let 'em know

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Y'all niggas wanna lay, I wanna play in a bitch mind
If she, playin' her Daddy, I will knock out her spine
I'm out here on the grind, 24/7 I'm gettin' it
I'ma let them tricks eat it up (up!), I ain't trippin' bitch!
(Bitch!) Bitch, bend over, let 'em see it girl (girl!)
Hoes in the club, like '96 showin' niggas love (love!)
I used to be off in the Chi-C in Atlanta ('lanta!)
Young girls poppin' cock out in Alabama ('bama!)
I seen it all from the pimps and the tricks (tricks!)
The real live boys, opening the pussy stores (pussy stores!)
I got respect for the flat backers (backers!)
Black, yellow, or crackers, keep ya Daddy ridin 'cause I'ma Cadillacer

[Chorus]

[Tela]
Oh, he Tela in the change, I put the ""G"" in the game
Put the ""P"" in the pimp (pimp), brought back the blue to the flame (flame)
Break a bitch like a trig, write out some magical shit
And while I feel more slim, that ain't my starter bitch!
Drop the top on the Rolls and roll under the sun
Throw my finger in the air like, ""Kid! Hoe I'm the one!""
Got my gators and suits, multiple colors like fruit
Pimp aroma on my breath, Tropicana and goose
To the roots of pianos, see my moves she can't handle
H.B.O., nigga hoe break up overtime Soprano
Diamonds up against panels of wood, it's all good
Lean back, candy 'llac gettin' head on my hood (hood)

Ladies and gentlemen! (gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen!)

And you are now apart of the Pimpalation! (Pimpalation!)

I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind

I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)


I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind
The thing I got I sell it, to get it all the time
A nickel or a dime, a half or a pound
Long as my bitch ridin', I'll put a nigga down
I'm a playa from the jump, a hustler from the start
Something in your chest, then open up your heart
I'm 'bouta bet it, like Memphis 10, they get it get it
Gotta have it have it, take it all, man if they let me
Ima run it, put somethin' on it, instead of bet it
It's that money, don't make no money, buddy I'm ready
Can I get it? It's win or lose, you know the rules
We rollin', we didn't hit it, now pay your dues

Now when it comes to gettin' that cash flow
I'm all about that paper, no credit, just straight dough
And for all who don't know, there's money out to be made
So get it while you can, and still it's just a phase
In the eyes of a hustler nigga, you'd be amazed
That time waits for no one, so God, I pray
Try hard not to fall through life stuck unemployed
So instead I keep on livin' what's given within my void
Put a end after hours scrapin' up all my change
From quarters to dimes, as you see, this ain't no game
So pick up on your pimpin', get on it and never slip
'Cause all on my mind is my money fully gripped (fully gripped)

[Chorus]

Just call me, the money maker, bread taker
Nigga Breaker, the pocket raper, money scraper
May do me a favor, stay the fuck up out my way-a
The rock that I can take it buddy to collect my paper
That might save ya, think of no anger, no player hater
No bumpin' heads, when it come to gettin' this paper
I'm a player, runnin' wit the, hand that was dealt
Flippin' my work, ridin' the left, fully equipped
Ain't fuckin' wit hoes, unless talkin 'bout bread
Duckin' these streets, givin' these strangers some head
Bringin' it back, makin' sho', my pockets swole
Workin' the streets, now they know they my hoes

I must ain't had it, I gotta get it
Nothin' to lose, shoot me a quarter, and watch me flip it
Shakin' these haters down the line, they somethin' wicked
You on a roll then pay yo' dues, then buy a ticket
Gather your cheddar 'round this world, there's nothin' better
But keep it boomin' like a system, through any weather
Stackin' my green, that's somethin' good, I'm on a mission
Trappin' hard just like I should, no penny pinchin'
And for the gold, we steady missin', and reminisin'
Buy some S, ain't even hittin', so stop yo' flippin
'Cause when I pull in all my cheese you besta know
There ain't no playin' wit my thang when you see my foe
Act like ya know

Ay you know what, eh-heh
When I started recordin this album
I said I wasn't gonna do a, y'know dear momma type of record but
I felt the need to cause ahhh I wanna express how I feel about my momma
But at the same time I wanted y'all to know that
if I ever found a woman out there that, was anything like my momma
SHIT~! I got to have her

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Ain't another girl on this earth, like my momma
But if I find that girl, I'ma make her my woman
If I find another girl, like my momma
I can go unconditional love 'til they take me under

[Yung Joc:]
Gyeah; first thing first, where do I start
This feeling that I'm feeling is real it's not a facade
The angel that I call momma was sent by God
Been through thick and thin, better times, even hard
Raisin two boys in the ghetto wasn't easy
Shit was goin wrong but she made it seem peachy
Yeah she worked long hours, whether rain and the freezin
Pulled out the Vicks vapor rub when I was sneezin
When the kid laid her off and the rent was past due
Mom was a O.G., did what she had to
I got kicked out of school, she had to talk to my principal
Yeah she kicked my ass, but her love is unconditional
I love my momma

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc:]
Yo, yo
I remember - my first BMX, she showed me how to ride
She used to lick her thumb to wipe the cold out my eyes
Oh yeah I can't forget her cookin how it stick to my ribs
She could take Spam and make a first class meal
When my nigga Steve, me and her both cried
And when I got locked up, she bailed me out every time
Guess I'll never know how she remained so strong
Received Medicaid and food stamps for so long
We was section 8 all the way 'til I was grown
She played both roles, king and queen of the throne
I'm not exaggeratin, not even to the slightest
This came from the heart, so I ain't even have to write it
I love my momma

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc:]
I'ma try to stop the music one time
Want y'all to clap with me, c'mon
Now if you love your momma clap yo' hands
If you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!)
If you love your momma clap yo' hands
If you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!)
Shorty, I brought you in this world, I'll take you out
You said it when you caught me skippin school, makin out
Momma you stayed down, you never faked it
Stayed by my side when they thought I wouldn't make it
And when I had a son, they said I need a job
That's when you told me son, just follow your heart
And so I did that, I went through all the drama
So I just wanna take this time to say I love you momma
