Big Eightball straight up out the south to you
Honey coated money fool that's all I wanna do
Spit dope that a nigga sat at the crip
And rolled me and philly phil on that flight
Always tight all night sleepy niggas don't get paid
They get made into broke niggas everyday
I'm on some finance increased raps and beats
Hip-hop Glock poppin' hollow point heat
What you boys need I got it by the pidound
Straight up out the midound make everybody get down
Sandy brown blades ways in a daze damn
Ain't eightball at the mall with the brades
Hey don't get fly cuz I can get fly too
Cruisin' in a six double 0 right by you

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.

Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,

Amon Amarth,"They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light

Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun

Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time

I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill

I see Hell's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die

Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true Gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone

I see Hell's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!

They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel

They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent

The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
Them will make them kneel

To Valhall they will ride",Abandoned,1998
Amon Amarth,"A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land

Thunder breaks the silence
Of five hundred men assembled on shore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty Amon Amarth
Reaching for the cloud cloaked skies
So grim and fearful in might

With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They stride through this darkened land
With only Mount Doom in their sight
The closer they get to the mountain
The clearer their eyes can see
A forest of one thousand spears awaiting
Awaiting the battle that will be

A cry of war emerges
Echoes over the field
Warriors riding like wolves of the snow
Boldly charging the enemy lines

With weapons so fearsome and sharp in their hands
And shields of oak wood and steel
They slit open stomachs and split skulls to the jaw
Intestines cover the field

The defenders are weak in this brutal war
The northmen have power and guts
A bloodshed like no one has seen here before
None can escape their cuts

Arrows with fire fly through the air
Torching houses and shields
The vikings can feel victory is near
As the enemy headlessly flees

A gust of wind blows in from the north
Clearing the clouds away
As twilight falls and the stars come forth
And the seawolves return to the bay

Corpses lie scattered all over the field
For the ravens to pick as they please
The mountain is now left there behind
As they sail with the first morning breeze",Amon Amarth,1998
Amon Amarth,"Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns

He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war

He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye

They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before

The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves

Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear

On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast

On course to far off lands

Across the waves our sea snakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death

And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blood drenched ground

The sword play is hard
And many falls
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stands the messengers of death

Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield

On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death

A warcry loud as Heimdall'shorne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stands

They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those died

With power they vield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men

Amon Amarth,"Ten heavy feet
Walks the blood soiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy sword cuts
Hurts to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammer like pounds
From falls, off slain
Horses, to the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought relentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud",Victorious March,1998
Amon Amarth,"I see
Without fear my destiny
As the raging skies begins to fade
Pouring rain
Licks my wounds as my blood flows
From my torn flesh

As I die
I hold my sword
My only friend
And pray that Odin
Will take me home

The battle rages
But I hear only raindrops falling
Like in slow motion to the ground

Death release me
Free me from my earthly pain
Odin I ask thee please
Take me home

Without fear I die

As I look
To the sky the heaven is lit
And Valkyries in shining armor
Descend

I rest my head
On the ground
And close my eyes
I know that Odin's sent for me
As I die

Without fear I die
I close my eyes
And die
Without fear",Without Fear,1998
Amon Amarth,"My pale face face glows in the light of fire
My hollow eyes see but cannot see
I stare deep into the glowing inferno
The loss I feel is breaking me

I heard their screams
Through flaming walls
Walls, I could not tear down
I could not help them

Helplessly I watched my life go up in flames

I pull the sword from the glowing fire
And hammer-beat in on the anvil

Forging it with rage and hate
I will seal my enemy's fate

I ingrave the blade with magic runes
And summon Gods by sacrifice in blood
Pure blue hate shines within this sword
his magic sword will cut only once

No sword has ever been like this one
The Avenger is its name

Now my sworn enemy
Vengeance will belong to me
A year has gone by
Now my sworn enemy
It's your turn to die
It's your turn to die!

The sword cuts through his throat
His head tumbles to the ground
The headless body lays gently down
Down to sleep in a pool of blood

The Avenger has lost its shine
The magic is now drained
Dull and useless it rests in my hand
Its purpose is soon fulfilled

Now hate is gone but emptiness remains
So I turn the blade around
And run it through my stomach veins
And I fall to the ground",Avenger,1999
Amon Amarth,"Making way through blades and spears
We attack at dawn
The glory scene is near
From northern gods we're spawned

Defender's fighting spirit crack
Torching house of single god
We öeave land burnt black
And bodies floating in blood

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Blasting forth with rage in our war eyes
We burn with hate
Cut our way through hordes of weak christian flesh
Cast them into death

War to us is holy

Amon Amarth,"Serpent tongue speaks to me
Of a man from southern land
How ancient Gods are enemies
But I don't understand

Hippocratic voice of love talks of peace and Christ
Blasphemer of Gods above
One thousand years of lies

They hold their swords to out throats
And force-feed us with faith
'Bout god, his son and holy whore
But now we retaliate

Prophets of a false believe talk with tongue of ice
Threaten us with hell beneath
Now we retaliate

Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down

Free yourselves from the chains
Of lies that hold you down
Arise to be free again
We'll fight till we have won

Priests of Hippocratic love talk of peace and Christ

Now christian hounds will pay

Charge ahead, no retreat
No merca, noone shall live
To us there is no defeat
No remorse to give

A wind of power blows from the north
The enemy shivers to the core
We slay with strength, pushing forth
Silence before the storm

The gates of Valhall open up
The ground beneath us shakes
As Oden leads the Gods to war
The Rainbow Bridge cracks

Nothing can stop this final attack
We carve up all in our path
Now there is no turning back
Final battle is here at last

A feast awaits us when we get back
Awaiting all that fought in wrath

Out of the mist
Breaks a dragon ship
Even more feared
Than the nail-ship ""Naglfar""

Cold-eyed he gazes towards the shoer
The dragon's head is grim and red
All covered with blood, a gift to the mighty Gods

That's gazed into his eyes
'Cause no one's returned that's met his fire

They say wolf-skinned men follow him
Berserks whose eyes burn with flames of ice

Some say mighty Thor
Guides their blades in war
They say they cannot be killed
Nor can their blood be spilled

Flashing blades rip through the air
Cracking shields with rumbling thunder
Rolling over the waves

Send men screaming to their death

Clouds of black cover the sea

Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men

Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege

They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed

From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down christians' spines

As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher

The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed

With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high

Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tear me up inside

Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
The way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed

My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame
So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, curse my name
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame

And pay for your mistakes

A burst of flames threw me into oblivion

The life I knew seems distant and unreal
A fading dream, a memory I can't recall

Am I real I can no longer tell
A notion tells me I still exist

Infinite dark through this void I float
Resting, waiting for the day
When I will live again

Eons pass or maybe I just blinked
Deeper into this hell I sink

Falling through Ginnungagap
I'm pulled towards an unseen gate
I seem to hear my name being called
I float towards these cries of fate

Faster than the speed of light
I am falling through universe

Stars flash by before my eyes
The time has come to return

Out of the dark into the light
Back into life I am cast

Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel:

Remorse! Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak, their accusations are all:

Lies! Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land

I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine

But I'm not afraid to die

Death! The day to die is here

Axe! Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death! Sweet death, relieve me from this world
Death! Sweet death, relieve me, relieve:

So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin

Fast and hard, show no mercy for these men

Break their spirits, crush their hearts

Charge!
Ride them down as they flee from our steel
Draw their blood, make them suffer

Where eons ago he arose to spill their christian blood

That yet no one's dared to touch

He pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip
The sign for demons to attack

No, Thor (won't) spare a single soul, nor let them get away alive

Amon Amarth,"He's running through the woods so black
A loyal servant of christ
Dogs are barking down his back
He's running for his life

He came with words of love and peace
These heathens had to be saved
He thought that he could make them see
Instead he was enslaved

In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee

Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die

He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes

His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
""Shut him up and hang him high!""

As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: ""There is a God""

Comes from the heavenly light

But I'm not as young as I used to be
Down the road waits misery
Why cannot death just set me free?

Countless armies have I attacked
Not once have I backed down
And though I've spilled a lot of blood
I never once received a mortal wound

I've raided shores in many lands
I cannot count the men I've killed

Relive their last fight
With passion, swords held high
As they ride in the morning mist

War cries sound

Charging horses with fire in breath
Rush to battle - in glory die!

Again they cut
With shining edges

Axes shine, again they're swung

Amon Amarth,"You've seen life through distorted eyes
You know you had to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And now there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell

Everything around you
What's it coming to
God knows as your dog knows
Bog blast all of you

Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you

Amon Amarth,"He hung on the windswept world tree
Whose roots no one knows
For nine whole days he hung there pierced
By Gugnir, his spear

Swimming in pain he peered into the depths
And cried out in agony
Reaching out he grasped the runes
Before falling back from the abyss

He gave himself unto himself
In a world of shearing pain
Go that we all may live our lives
By the wisdom that he gained

You doubted him, and spread their lies
Across the world, with sword in hand
You raped our souls, and stole our right
All for the words of mild-mannered man

You listened to mild-mannered god
And put your faith in deceitful words
Your powertrip was paid by blood
In kindness' name you spilled our blood

I refuse to submit
To the god you say is kind
I know what's right, and it is time
It's time to fight, and free our minds

Let me die without fear
As I have lived without it
So shut your mouth and spare my ears
I'm fed up with all your bullshit

Let the berserks rise again
Let the world hear these words once more

This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt

Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their steaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me
Makes me feel so good

They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes

Each man has something that I crave
I ate their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves

They attacked our home, we kept them out

There was twenty dead on each side

Tattered banners and bloody flags
Rusty spears and blades

Cries ring out, loud and harsh
From cracked and broken horns
Long forgotten battle cries
In strange and foreign tongues

Against the broken shields they beat
They bring their hate and anarchy

There comes Lopt, the treacherous
He stands against the gods
His army grim and ravenous
Lusting for their blood

Trembles to its roots

Behind them Midgaard burns

And the Fenris wolf returns

Heimdal grips the Giallarhorn
He sounds that dreaded note

Amon Amarth,"We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave

The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting

The aging king had no descendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born

The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit

Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife

With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again

Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're aging men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears

Into the unknown

For him it's much too late
He puts his back into the oar
And rows towards his fate

The ship cuts through, the milk white mist
Through the blind they clearly hear
The oar strokes of their mighty fleet
Battle's drawing near
His heart pounds loud and wild
He's waited for this day
Then suddenly a dragon's head
Appears out of the haze

Back on the Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He vowed to return (to return)
And to make them burn

It sweeps the mist away

Fills the misty sky

Cries of war as weapons clash
Uncertain who will win

Thunder rolls 'cross the waves
Lightning cracks the sky
Clouds release hail big as grapes
As arrows are let fly

Hear the berserks roar
They call to mighty Thor
The fury in their raging eyes
Will burn forever more
Hear the weapons sing
Feel the arrows sting
They climb onto the Earl's great ship
And begin to swing

The fight is fierce as they attack
With sword and axe, no guts, no glory
Arrow pierced, they won't back down
They battle on with heart and fury
Then it turns the flanking ships give way
And soon they are embattled
Standing firm fight 'til death
They refuse to die like cattle

Fighting for his life
No holds barred
So close to revenge
Close but yet so far

Then he stands before him
It's like the battle fades
He sees his father's eyes
As he's struck into the waves

Back on Northern shores (Northern shores)

He has met his fate (met his fate)
In these cold dark waves (cold dark waves)

I had to wipe the smile away
I was not yet a man, nor was I a boy
But still, I made that bastard pay

So I left him there, on the stone floor
Bathing in a pool of his own blood

To leave this wretched place for good

I swore that I'd return that I would see him burn
I will live it in my dreams the smell, the blood, his dying screams

To my father I was dead, he took his hand from me
He drove me away, I was shunned
My one and only choice was to leave this land
To become the pagan they would hunt

A put-on masquerade
Hey look at the Loosey Girls
They are losers first
And burning fast",Loosey Girls,1975
Amon Düül,"A peculiar kind of bathing took place yesterday
King Ludwig was to meet the Doc on Starnbergsee
The Doctor's will is the monarchists' politicians'
Was he bad, asks Sissi the snake
I was not mad, says Ludwig the fake
Castles were built of marble and gold
The king's left alone, suddicts were sold
Our king has lost his grip and his virility
He drowned himself at dawn the waves wept jewellery

He wasn't yet dead when Wagner wrote the requiem
Was he bad, asks Sissi the snake
I was not mad, says Ludwig the fake
Castles were built of marble and gold
The king's left alone, suddicts were sold
Is he dead? the chancellor raves
What a drag! Bavaria's pride
Was it a bet? the court is amazed
Was he a fag? he ran out of sand",Ludwig,1975
Amon Düül,"Let's face the quiet before the storm
Flying carpets we'll be gliding on
Don't you please disillusion me
Open your eyes for the promised land to be seen

Oh consider well which way you might go
Ravens certainly will not show
Standing on the corner with a mind delay
Ain't today tomorrow's yesterday

Memories surfing upon red waves
Time sometime hurts but time often saves
Slow motion pictures, colored sounds
Fly fish jumping all around

You don't know 'bout the games they play
Only children instinctively know the way
Shall we apologize that we've been born
Instead of blowing the golden horn",Ain't Today Tomorrow's Yesterday,1977
Amon Düül,"When the everywhere-eye
Asks you
Who is the emperor
Of the sky
Take the Archangel's Thunderbird

Go to Edgar Allen
In the tower of sleep
He'll tell you a story
Which makes you to creep
The echo of your cries
Is falling so deep

Rent a destroyer
And sail to Cape Cod
There lives a lion
They call him God
There is no elevator to Eden
But a hole in the sky

In shock-corridors
People are standing
With their eyes in their hands
But they don't understand
Why their confessional folding-chairs
Go into the narcotic flight of stairs

Baiting soldiers are sleeping
In the melting House of Wax
Why is the audience not taking
The insurrection-axe
Thousands of windows burst open
And the alarm bells are broken",Archangels Thunderbird,1989

É preciso um bocado de tristeza, é preciso um bocado de tristeza

Sung so softly with the stars
Reflected in her eyes

It's the blaze that beckons men
Into the woods, of beaten path
Is the sight of the fire that
No maiden's eyes should have
Iron does as iron's told
And drinks of life's red gold
But shame won't leave with dying breathe
The life that wants it's own death

And the forest hums its silent hymn
Heard by those of solitude
As mist it wells
Up the brook's dark banks
Bewitched by there fir woods

It's the blaze that beckons men
Into the woods, of beaten path
Is the sight of the fire that
No maiden's eyes should have
Iron does as iron's told
And drinks of life's red gold
But shame won't leave with dying breathe
The life that wants it's own death",Rusty Moon,1999
Amorphis,"My soul is bleeding
I feel so small
Afraid that this will never end
I can't understand the pain in my bones
I sleep through another trance

Climb over the rainbow
From here you can see so much
I need someone to take me down
But who can you trust

Got so many things to say
But it's something I don't want to be
Gotta get away case it's time to shine
Like a fallen angel I run
I won't ever see the sun
See the circle is now complete
Yet the harvest remains undone

Where hemlock grows and vermin crowl
All dreams descend with fear
Crushed by the darkness that wells inside
That beast I hold so dear",Shining,1999
Amorphis,"Sorrow is my bread
And tears I drink as wine
Oblivion my happiness
Ground under teeth of time

For cold be the stone
When frost ve devoured the land
Consolation is no gift
Of winter's icy hand

[Chorus:]
Upon a crust of snow
I'll lay my broken frame
What steel and iron won't take
I'll give in winter's name
No good a sullen sout no use a simple knave
No groom for brides of plaited hair
This man old and lame

If only I could breathe
To see the sun of may
but still longer are the nigths than days
As I wither away

Came the man of crown
With sound of war drums beat
Said no sword arm's strong enough
Without my two good feet

But not overlooked am I
In eyes of the maid I'll wed
I'll reap the crops of Tuonela
My bride's wealth in death",Tuonela,1999
Amorphis,"Forging the future from the timeless stone
Oh let me know how far I can go
Answering the questions thet no one ever asks
Float through the sea of madness
And face the everlasting task

So lonely to wander
So sad to be alone
In the mist of the unknown
Trying to fool myself with dreams that never come true
So hard to stand my ground
Never again will I fail

[Chorus:]
Will you tell me not to wait
Tell me to live for today

As the flowers wither
I will forget my pain
Since the stars have shone
The devil has shown me the way

Amorphis,"Tear dimmed remembrance 
In a womb of time
Breath upon me
Possessed by the passion
Fate will set you free
Infertile
Chased be the precious 
When flesh is an enemy
Fair weather man 

Step aside from the way of a better man than you
So you fall at his feet he's the one who betrays you
It's the servants devotion for the decay
Stand up

There are no flowers on your grave
There are no chains
There I keep chanting for the forgotten name

Why you feel so empty
And still have everything
It's fulfillment
I've got more companions
When I'm all alone

Amorphis,"I walk down to the seashore 
To bury my hate 
I wait till the morning of the mourning 
But it's too late 
Down to the seashore 
Through the illuminous gate 
You wait for tomorrow but today is today 
No one can understand my pain 

Find me the ocean 
Where waters stand still 
Nothing can befall evermore 
Find me the ocean which swallows all that floats 
It's time to prevail your conspiracy 

It's a whisper of a dead man 
I've heard it before 
It's yearning my emotions 
Before I was born 
It was only delusion 
Of illuminous gate 
'cause today is the day 

Find me the ocean 
Where waters stand still 
Nothing can befall evermore 
Find me the ocean which swallows all that floats 
It's time to prevail your conspiracy 

Calm is the breath that breaks the circle of silence

Amorphis,"In my dream smoke followed me
As on fire the whole world had been
To the yard I walked in
Up the frontstep and opened the door

Cranes flew over to the North
As I walked on dry
And passed through a grove
Yellow with flowers

They had been expecting me
They said so and I believed
I'm my dream smoke came to me
And we became as one

Amorphis,"Still searching for my way
The right way to be
Still pondering
What I've done

I'm still thinking what I've said
Still finding from within
And all that I know
Is still not enough

I'm being held by the one
Shadow tormenting my soul
The curving neck of the swan
The slow turning of a bird?s head

So white its plumes and feathers
Its breast like the moon in water

Silent and tranquil it moves
On the river in the calm

I wander back on familiar roads
I sense the marks I left on the hills
I see the cuts and wounds of my deeds
They make me muse on life

Up the hill and the mountain
I look back, I look down
There flows the River of Death
And here the wind in my hair",Black River,2007

Amos Lee,"Early morning in a motel room
Sunshine trying to creep on through
Lost sleep but I found a tune
Stuck inside my head
Cigarettes, a tank of gas
Headed off to nowhere fast
Gotta find a way to make this feeling last

'Cause I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
Oh it's funny how time can make you realize
We're running out of it

On the day that I die
I wanna to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I've lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands

A part of dawn to be ashamed of
But good people are supposed to be up
But I found peace with the path I took
As I lay down my head
Crossroads you gotta choose
Which way do we win or lose
But every bone in my soul says to sing on through

'Cause I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just keep on singing these melodies

Amos Lee,"This old guitar taught me to sing a love song,
It showed me how to laugh and how to cry.
It introduced me to some friends of mine and brightened up some days.
It helped me make it through some lonely nights.
What a friend to have on a cold and lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady, it opened up her eyes and ears to me.
It brought us close together and I guess it broke her heart,
It opened up the space for us to be, what a lovely place and a lovely space to be.

This old guitar gave me my life my living all the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny mountainside,
And most of all, to sing my songs for you, I love to sing my songs for you,
Yes I do, you know, I love to sing my songs for you.",This Old Guitar,2013

I'm a motherfuckin' star, I don't battle no mo'
I provide the gun clapping a round of applause after your show
We can go toe-to-toe cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, ""That's all you got?""
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice quit talking it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit - you don't chew, you don't breathe
You'll miss a fucking line
Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot
Leave me in the deck too long I blow up your box: boom!",Boom,2009

Waking cross the river, river of delusion
Full moon lures the waves, waves of desperation
Empty hearts and mouths wither away

Slow your breath
Dream of northern lights

No te sientas perdido
Gira, vuelta why vuelta gira

Que viene a verte

Broken heart
No water here to drink way downstream
One goes where the water flows and water's running dry
So don't give up no don't cry, don't cry

Just close our eyes
Pretend we forget

Twist this dance of death

Amrs Ill,"HOOK:
Why is it more that things change the more they stay the same?
Why do old people drive slow in the fast lane?
Why is it when I grab the mic you stare at me strange?

Why's every time I eat I get my shirt stained? (dang!)
Wassup Tremaine, what, your name's Wayne?
Dang man, why can't I just remember people's names?
All the same there's a question in my mind
Why do I have to wait in line just to wait in another line
And when I think I'm done I gots to do it one more time?
Why oh why am I always stuck behind
The lady who has writes a check in the express check out line?
Excuse me miss, it's 10 items not 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
Why do most rappers they just spit the same rhymes?
Why do girls go to the bathroom at the same time?
Why when something's wrong I just say I'm fine?
But why ask why when I ask it all the time?

CHORUS:
Why is the grass green? Why's the sky blue?
Why oh why do I do what I do?
Can you please tell me why that is cause I don't have a clue?
Now why is that? I was about to ask you.
Why am I me? and why are you you?
Why do we run in circles chasing after nothing new?
Somebody won't you please tell me why because I haven't got a clue?
Yo why is it my man? I was about to ask you.

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do the voices in my head get louder when I try to sleep?
Why can't I seem to count all the leaping sheep?
I'm knee deep in distribution, retail, paperwork, and e-mail.
Why can't I afford a secretary to handle office detail?
Why are prices high, water wet, people cruel?
Why does every single record exec try to play me for the fool?
Why don't bar stools have backs? Do they want the drunks to fall off?
And why do we have to fill up all the precious silence with small talk?
Why do we all walk with our heads down and walkmans up to ten?
Are we afraid to let a stranger in every now and then?
Why do sucker emcees spit loud and claim to be the hardest
And then sit down to write their rhymes with a dictionary plus a thesaurus?
Why does the commerce strangle art instead of the other way around?
I guess it's hard to work the angles when the cipher's always round.
Why do we drown our sorrow, reach both hands out for tomorrow
When just living today is hard enough to swallow? Why?

CHORUS

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do conceptual song structures cramp my style and hand alike?
Why do organized emcee battles make wack rappers grab the mic?
Why am I here, cause the instruction manual wasn't clear?
Why does my transmission make that sound when I try to shift it's gears?
Why is my stereo so loud? Do I want all neighbors to hear?
Am I my own street team member try to catapult my career?
Why does a dog bark, bee sting, bird sing?
But first things first, why do you burn my album with left hands on your purse string?

(KJ)
Why do we disrespect each other instead of loving one another?
Why do we have to focus on the skin tone and color?
Why can't we see that we sisters and we brothers
And understand we all equal to God and plus He loves us?
Bust this. Ima say this just again and again.
Why oh why can't we all be friends?
But there's one things I just can't comprehend.
Why do they put Braille at a drive-up ATM?
I guess that's for all the car driving blind men.
Why do we just hate God but really love to sin?
Really, man, shouldn't that be just the other way around?
Why do I always have to laugh when somebody falls down?
Why do things get worse when they're already going wrong?
Why's customer service put me on hold for so long?
Why do you tell me to hold on when I'm already holding on?
Why can't we all just get along?

CHORUS

Why does fast food take so long to get it?
Why do people fart in public and say someone else did it?
Why do you ask my opinion but get mad when I give it?
And why ask for wisdom if you ignore the Holy Spirit?
Now check the lyrics cause this might apply to you.
Dude, why's brushing your teeth just like so hard for you?
Now if your breath stank, don't be be saying ""Hi, how are you?""
If I give you a breath mint, don't be like, ""No, thank you.""
Get a clue, now tell me why your clothes is fake, too.

Why do you say it's FUBU when ya know it's PUBU?
And why do you say yes when you really mean no?
Why do you tell me to stop when you really mean go?
Why's the bad choice the one choice I always chose?
But in spite of how I acted, why did God love me so
Much the He would just pay the price of my soul?
But I don't need to ask why. I already know.

Just a little bit more passion
This is how it should begin

If you leave me now
Telling me you failed somehow
Better think it all over

Here's a true romance
Be aware and take your chance

Amy,"There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed, some for ever not for better
Some have gone and some remained
All these places had their moments

With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I love them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There Is no one compares with you
And these memories loose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

No I know I'll never loose affection
For people and things that once before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more, love you more

Life's a happy song when there's someone by my side to sing along

I've got everything that I need right in front of me
Nothing's stopping me nothing that I can't be with you right here next to me

Life's a piece of cake with someone to give and someone to take
Life's a piece of pie with someone to wash and someone to dry
Life's an easy road with someone beside you to share the load
Life is full of highs with someone to stir and someone to fry

Life's a leg of lamb with someone there to lend a hand
Life's a bunch of flowers with someone to while away the hours
Life's a fillet of fish, eh! Yes it is
Life's a happy song when there's someone by your side to sing along

Nothing's stopping me, nothing that I can't be with you right here next to me

Sorry, super excited
Oh this is the most romantic thing ever
I've always dreamt of seeing Los Angeles
I know Walter can't wait either
You don't mind that he's coming, right?
Oh no, no, of course not
As long as we can spend our anniversary dinner together
That's all I ask
Ok, let me go check on Walter

Everything is great everything is grand
Expect Gary's always off with his friend
It's never me and him, it's always me and him
And him, wonder when it's going to end
But I guess that's ok 'cause maybe someday
I know just how it's going to be
You'll ride up on a steed and get down on one knee
And say Mary will you marry me, please

I've got everything that I need right in front of me
Nothing's stopping me nothing
That I can't be with you right here next to me

You've got everything
That you need right in front of you
Nothing's stopping you nothing
That you can't do that the world will throw at you

And once again I'm on my own
My man ain't here
He's gone and done me wrong

No one's gonna stop
This girl from having fun
I throw my hands up high
And have a party for one

I'm having a me party
A party by myself
A me party!
I don't need nobody else

I'm having a me party
I'm the first and last to show
There's no one at this party
That I don't already know

I'm not gonna sit around
By myself and wait for you
Haven't you heard
One is the new two

I'm gonna make a scene
I'm gonna make a fuss
Tonight I'm gonna celebrate with
Just the one of us

I'm having a me party
I don't need no invitation
A me party
I just love the conversation

Me party

A party for one, not two ,you do the math Frog
It means I don't need you

I won't lie,
There are times
When I wish I was with you
There are days when all this girl can see
Is a world that's made for two
At times like this I feel alone
And it's like nobody cares
But I only have to call my name
And darling I'll be there!

I'm having a me party
Haven't I seen me here before
A me party
I'm the last one on the dance floor

Me party
A party just for moi
Me party
This is solo mardi gras

Me party
I'm such good company
Me party!
I save the last dance for me

Everybody wants to know their true love is true

How do you know he's yours?

And the pinpoint Oxford shirt from

And all at once the happiness I knew,

Life goes on
Life goes on without you baby

While the road is bending - we don´t even steer

Turning on the headlights - hanging by a thread

sun's bursting in
Through the drapes,
I awake as a new day starts
Feeling I am clear in my mind I'm alive, I'm in love
Feel
It in my heart
The day opens up on the world like a
Dream
And I start to smile

This thing I have
With you?s not a feeling,
A sense it is more like a state
Of mind

Wherever you go I will follow
I just
Wanna be where you are
Like a shooting star, you shine
Brightest of them all
Wherever you go I will follow
And it doesn?t matter how far
Like a shooting star, you
Shine brightest of them all

Once I was torn, I was
Lost, I felt weak until I found you
You hit me with the
Spark of a light in your eyes
Keep me cool and I feel brand
New
Like a breath of fresh air like a natural high
I
Lose sense of time

This thing I have with you?s not a
Feeling,
A sense it is more like a state of mind

Wherever you go I will follow
I just wanna be where you
Are
Like a shooting star, you shine brightest of them
All
Wherever you go I will follow
And it doesn?t
Matter how far
Like a shooting star, you shine brightest of
Them all

Flashes of light

And I wonder what I've done
Holy Father, you have come
And chosen me now
To carry your son

I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone,
Must I walk this path alone?

Hold me together
Be forever near me

Pour over me your holiness

If a wiser one one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan
Help me be strong 
Help me be

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,

Amy Grant,"Once my life had no direction, I was lost as could be
I was caught in a whirlpool, spinning around in misery
I needed a friend, you took me in and you touched my heart
With your song of love you gave me a brand new start

Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said
Angels singin', joy bells ringing inside my head
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love

You gave me just enough to make me hunger for more of you
Now I'm hooked on your lovin' and I don't want to break loose
With my heart in my hand, I'm yours to command, do what you want me to
Just never let me go, Lord, I'm so in love with you

Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love

You're always there to see me through.
I can't get by unless I lean on you, Lord.

[Chorus]
The Lord has a will,
and I have a need
to follow that will;
to humbly be still.
To rest in it, nest in it,
fully be blessed in it;
following my father's will.

Your law of love is in my heart.
You wrote it there, it won't depart.
It lights my way, and keeps me out of the dark.

into my life, and there it's grown.
It's roots go deep where living waters are known.

Amy Grant,"I love to sing and I love to pray
Worship the Lord most every day
I go to the temple and I just want to stay
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways

And I'd love to live on a mountain top
Fellowshipping with the Lord
I'd love to stand on a mountain top
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar

But I've got to come down from that mountain top
To the people in the valley below
Or they'll never know that they can go
To the mountain of the Lord

Now praising the Father is a good thing to do
To worship the trinity in spirit and truth
But if we worshiped all of the time
There would be no one to lead the blind

But I'd love to live on a mountain top
Fellowshipping with the Lord
I'd love to stand on a mountain top
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar

But I've got to come down from that mountain top
To the people in the valley below
Or they'll never know that they can go
To the mountain of the Lord

Now I am not saying that worship is wrong
But worship is more than just singin' a song
It's all that you say and everything that you do
It's letting his spirit live through you

Still I'd love to live on a mountain top
Fellowshipping with the Lord
I'd love to stand on a mountain top
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar

But I've got to come down from that mountain top
To the people in the valley below
Or they'll never know that they can go
To the mountain of the Lord

Amy Grant,"Are you living in an old man's rubble
Are you listenin' to the father of lies

Are you walking' with unnecessary burdens
Are you trying to take them upon yourself
If you are then you're living in bondage
And you know that's bad for your spiritual health

And are you trying to live by your emotions
Are you puttin' your faith in what you feel and see
Then you're living just to satisfy your passions
And you better be careful, 'cause you're being deceived

Are you living in an old man's rubble

If you listen too long, you'll eventually die

Are you puzzled by the way that you're behavin'
Do you wonder why you do the things you do
And are you troubled by your lack of resistance
Do you fell that something's got a hold on you

Well, deep within' you there's a spiritual battle
There's a voice of the darkness and the voice of the light
And just by listening you've made a decision
'Cause the voice you hear is gonna' win the fight

Are you living in an old man's rubble
Are you listenin' to the father of lies
If you are then you're headed for trouble
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die

If you're living as a new creation
If you're listening to the Father of light
Then you're living in a mighty fortress
And you're gonna' be clothed in power and might

Amy Grant,"Well, I don't understand this love I have inside
Would it be the same without that twinkle in your eye?
And would it be the same if you came and said goodbye
Forever?

I only know that the love that I feel
Doesn't come from somewhere inside of me
But I see it keeps on growing, so I guess I'll just keep going
'Cause I'm confidently knowing it's from the Lord

And it grows on and on, flowing on and on
Don't you see we just can't hide love?
From growing on and on, flowing on and on
There's so many ways to say I love you, I love you

So I pray for eyes to see your needs
And ears to hear your spirit gently plead

Well, I think I understand this love I have inside
It's coming from the Father; it will never be denied
Even if you came to me right now and said goodbye
Forever

Forever

Don't you see we just can't hide love?

I was letting an illusion
Come into this heart of mine

Fairytale, searchin' for a fairytale
Hiding in a world
Where life was simple all the time

I was just like Peter Pan in Never Never Land
Afraid of what the future might be
Afraid to face the things I couldn't understand
Afraid of things that I couldn't see

But fantasy, I know
There's more to life than a fantasy
There's so much more
That my life was meant to be
So much more than make-believe

Fairytale, it seems just like fairytale
But there's something in my hear
That says this time the story's real

Fairytale, extraordinary tale
Of a King who offers love
So far beyond what I can feel

There's a world out there
That human eyes can never see
But it's just within the reach of the heart
Two princes wages the battle for eternity
But the Victor has been known from the start

Now I can see the truth
Can seem so much like a fantasy
But make-believe was never as real to me
I know this time the story's true

Just like Sleeping Beauty in a Neverland
I was dying under a spell
But then a Prince who comes from the Foreverland
Awakened me from my fairytale

When good is not around;
Eyes that find the source of help,
When help just can't be found;

Seeing every pain;
Knowing what you're going through
And feeling it the same.

Amy Grant,"I had laid some mighty plans 
Thought I held them in my hands 
Then my world began to crumble all away I tried to build it back again 
I couldn't bear to see it end 
How I hurt to know You wanted it that way. 
(Chorus) 
And I'm so glad, glad to find the reason 
That I'm happy-sad that
You've torn it all away 
And I'm so glad, though it hurts to know I'm leaving Everything I ever thought that I would be 
Once I held it in my hand 
It was a kingdom made of sand 
But now you've blown it all away 
I can't believe that I can say that I'm glad.
Long before my plans were made I know a master plan was laid 
With a power that superceded my control 
And if that truth could pierce my heart I wouldn't wander from the start Trying desperately to make it on my own.

When I see that Your lovin' has found me

When I'm dancin' his light is a favor

When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say,

She’s got her father’s eyes,
Her father’s eyes;
Eyes that find the good in things,
When good is not around;
Eyes that find the source of help,
When help just can’t be found;
Eyes full of compassion,
Seeing every pain;
Knowing what you’re going through
And feeling it the same.
Just like my father’s eyes,
My father’s eyes,
My father’s eyes,
Just like my father’s eyes.

And on that day when we will pay for all the deeds we have done,
Good and bad they’ll all be had to see by everyone.
And when you’re called to stand and tell just what you saw in me,
More than anything I know, I want your words to be,

She had her father’s eyes,

When good was not around;
Eyes that found the source of help,
When help would not be found;

Amy Grant,"I remember many times when I was just a child
How I played in that old house out on the farm
With rocking chairs and squeaky stairs, all pieces of her world
And a fire in her room to keep us warm

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark

And now we're not as young as when I played there all the time
And the visits seemed too scarce and far between
But life goes on at Mimi's house and in my mind I'm there
With a fire in her room to keep us warm

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark

And when I stop and think of how she's aging
Growing strong and graceful in her God
Well, you know it takes my fear away from aging
She seems to know the secret that we'll never be apart

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark
Yes, she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark

Every time I turn around
Oh I never really know quite what to expect
But it won't get me down

'Cause I know you bring each and every thing
Just to teach me how to live
And the secret of it all is trusting in you
And the wisdom to give

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future when it blinds you today
Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way
'Cause we've got to break away
Break away to be

Faith-walkin' people, can't rely on everything we feel
Faith-talkin' people, we must discern what's really real
Faith-walkin' people, you can't believe in everything we see
Faith-talkin' people seems like such a mystery

But in all the earth there is nothing worth
Half as much as life with you
'Cause the people and the things we're counting on here
They're gonna pass away too

I don't understand everything is planned
But I don't really have to know
'Cause he's giving me a joy that's filling my heart
When I learn to let go

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay

And I may not hear the cheers of a crowd
And my voice can't always rise to make the mountains ring
And at times I can't even sing out aloud

But You've got me singing a love song
Melody and rhyme, it moves me every time
You've got me singing a love song
And it keeps You on my mind, oh, on my mind
Feelin' fine all the time it keeps You on my mind

Sometimes my voice is strained and the strings won't hold a tune
My back is sore and I'm just too tired to try
And I don't want to work or rest or think of You
Or face the world or even close my eyes

But You've got me singing a love song
Melody and rhyme, it moves me every time, I know that
You've got me singing a love song
And it keeps You on my mind, oh, on my mind
Feelin' fine all the time it keeps You on my mind

My broken dreams, they don't bother me
And hard times in life I don't mind
I think of things that I'd rather see
And You give me piece of mind

Hard times will come and sometimes I won't wanna sing
But I'll sing with all the love that I can find
And I'm happy there to hear me in the silence of my song
I'm gonna sing for You until the end of time

'Cause you've got me singin' a love song
Melody and rhyme, it moves me every time
You've got me singing a love song
And it keeps You on my mind, oh, on my mind
Feelin' fine all the time it keeps you on my mind

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Immanuel But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in.",Little Town,1983
Amy Grant,"Hurry now wake up your eyes
Time for little ones to see
Daddy's got a big surprise
Hiding there beneath the Christmas tree
How they are like the child in me!
See the wonder in their eyes
Like a fairytale come true
One more time I realize
All the love our lives found in you

Love has come
For the world to know
As the wise men knew
Such a long time ago
And I believe that angels sang
That hope had begun
When the god of glory
Who is full of mercy
Sent his son

If I could have a special dream
Coming true on Christmas morn'
I would want the world to see
How his father smiled when Christ was born
The greatest gift the world has known!
So come on kids, look high and low
For all the toys you've dreamed to find
But I believe you'll never know
A greater joy than Jesus' love inside

Amy Grant,"A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great, and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth, His Name, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us:
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing over the plains
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains.

Why your joyous strains prolong?

At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop!
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy

It's a holy struggle, and it won't let go of me

If Jesus lived His own life and I lived mine

But even when it's most frustrating, this kid's not walking out

Amy Grant,"""Take this man to prison,"" the man heard herod say,
And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away.
Chained up between two watchmen, peter tried to sleep,
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep.
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,
And running to his people before the break of day,
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:

Angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,
Angels watching over me!

God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.
If you're asking what's protecting me then you're gonna hear me say:

Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angles watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,
Angels watching over me

Angels watching over me
Angels watching over me

Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,
Angels watching over me!
Angels watching over me, every step I take,

Angels watching over me,

I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deceiver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.

I have decided,
Being good is just a fable,
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.
I'm gonna leave it to the lord.

There's a wealth of things that I profess,
I said that I believed,
But deep inside I never changed;
I guess I'd been deceived.

'cause a voice inside kept telling me,
That I'd change by and by,
But the spirit made it clear to me,
That kind of life's a lie.

I have decided,
I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deciver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.

I just can't 'cause I'm not able.
I'm gonna leave it to the lord.

So forget the game of being good,
And your self-righteous pain.
'cause the only good inside your heart
Is the good that jesus brings.

And when the world begins to see you change,
Don't expect them to applaud.
Just keep your eyes on him and tell yourself,
I've become the work of god.

I have decided,
I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deceiver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.

Though she never was in Vogue magazine or on TV;
Her husband loves her dearly,

Kisses her little baby girl.

Now that she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.

And nothing short of death's gonna ever leave me cold.
Well, still at times it's lonely,
But through it all it only
Makes me love Jesus more,
And this is what He came here for.

I can't imagine ever leaving now.
Now that I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.

I'll cling to you with all my might

And that love will fan the flame
And that flame will warm the heart that's waiting

You are mine and I'll wait for you my love

Even if it takes a lifetime
Tell me you'll wait

I'm not a child but my heart still can dream.

Then wars would never start,
And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,
And love would never end

Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree.

They thought they had us down
But we came around
How we rolled and rambled
We got lost and we got found
Now we're back on solid ground, yeah

We took everything
All our times would bring
In this world of dangers
'Cause when your heart is strong
You know you're not alone
In this world of strangers

Turning into spring,
Oh, it speaks to this heart of mine
More than anything.
Underneath a blanket of snow
Cold and white,
Something is stirring in the still of the night.
When the sun comes up
Slowly with the dawn,
Oh, this is the common feeling
That I hang my hope up on.
There is a love and beauty
In all that I see
And no one, nobody
Is explaining you to me.

And maybe my eyes can't see
But you are surrounding me
Here in the wind and rain,
The things that I know.
Are tender and sweet
This song as my lead,
I know the voice, I know the touch,
Lover of my soul.

When the evening sun
Slowly fades to red
Time and time and time again
I whisper in my head.
Give me grace
Give me strength
To firmly believe
That the maker of this whole wide world is a father to me.

And maybe my eyes can't see
But you are surrounding me
Here in the wind and rain,
The things that I know.
Are tender and sweet
This song as my lead,
I know the voice, I know the touch,
Lover of my soul.

And maybe my eyes can't see

And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.

For the chilrden of the world

Heaven plants a special seed
And we must have faith for these

I will stand for the truth I've seen
So the truth is seen in me
I will give from the source of love
So all that I believe is handed down
For the road that's yet to be travelled on
By the ones who will carry on, I'll carry on

Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

Ooh you made me love you

Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

Turn a light on somewhere down inside

Somewhere within
And when you think about
What might have been

Take the bitter
With the sweet

How do you argue with a feeling in your bones
'Bout what is and what isn't meant to be

And you never let it show

The day I watched you leave
But I hope you'll think of me
When tender winds blow
Sit on the shores of love
And just let it go

All that remains today are echoes from the past

Where we used to belong
There ain't nobody home
Said, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh

But, ain't nobody home
Packed up, moved away, runnin' from the past
Leaving behind the dusty dreams and broken glass

Behind the eyes
Broken promises and dreams

Safe and warm

We can reach out through the tears

To where hope can be found

We cannot see
The hunger and the longing everyone of us
Knows inside
Could be the bridge between us if we try

For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

I love Thee because Thou has first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;

My grown-up Christmas list,
Not for myself, but for a world in need:

No more lives torn apart,
Then wars would never start,
And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list.

As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree.

That packages and bows
Can never heal a hurting human soul.

And wars would never start,
And time would heal all hearts.
And every one would have a friend,
And right would always win,

Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth!

I rest my weary soul in thee
I give thee back the life I owe
That in thine ocean depths its flow
My richer, fuller be

O light that followest all my way
I yield my flickering torch to thee
My heart restores its borrowed ray
That in thy sunshines glow its day
May brighter, fairer be

I cannot close my heart to thee

In lowly paths of service free

In work that keeps faith sweet and strong
In truth that triumphs over wrong

Far down the future's broadening way

All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about my Savior's face

Here comes my old friend, the preacher
He's knockin' on my front door
He's out tryin' to save all the sinners
He's been here so many times before

I love the easy conversation
Man, that preacher sure can talk
It brings up my need for salvation
Even though he knows I'm stubborn to a fault

Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
Lord, I need just a little more faith

I walked by the church Sunday mornin'
I slipped on in the back door
It's sure been a long time coming
And tell my preacher what I need to know

His words were like a cool drink of water
He said, ""Sinners come on down the aisle""
So I went runnin' for the alter
You should have seen my old friend, the preacher smile

Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
I long to see my Savior's face
Oh, I long to see my Savior's face

Amy Grant,"Got a ticket coming home,
Wish the officer had known
What a day today has been.
Then I stumbled through the door,
Dropping junk mail on the floor.
When will this day end?

But then your letter caught my eye,
Brought the hope in me to life,
Cause you know me very well,
And I bet you wrote me
Just to tell me,

[Chorus]
In a little while,
Well be with the father;
Cant you see him smile? (oh
In a little while,
Well be home forever,
In a while
Were just here to learn to love him
Well be home in just a little while.

Boy, that letter hit the spot
Made me think of all I've got,
And all that waits for me.
Guess Ive known it all day long;
Wonder where my thoughts went wrong.
When will my heart believe?

Waking half way through the night,
Reaching toward the lamp for light,
Picking up the word I find;
Here's another letter
To remind me.

[Chorus]

Days like these are just a test of our will.
Will we walk or will we fall?
Well, I can almost see the top of the hill,
And I believe its worth it all.

But when I close my eyes
I remember

I guess it always will

Time stands still

And I love your company
Stay for awhile
And remember the days gone by
For a moment it can seem
Just the way it used to be

Clear summer days
Warm and lazy
Long walks, long talks, after dark
We vowed we'd never forget
Now it's hazy

And time alters our view
It would be nice to
Spend some time with you

Amy Grant,"I see her as a little girl 
Hiding in her room 
She takes another bath 
And she sprays her mama's perfume 
To try to wipe away 
The scent he left behind 
But it haunts her mind 

You see, she's his little rag 
Nothing more than just a waif 
And he's mopping up his need 
She is tired and afraid 
Maybe she'll find a way 
Through these awful years 
To disappear 

Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven 
Where did He go in the middle of her shame? 
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven 
I see no mercy, and no one down here's naming names 
Nobody's naming names 

Now, she's looking in the mirror 
At a lovely woman face 
No more frightened little girl 
Like she's gone without a trace 
Still she leaves the light 
Burning in the hall 
It's hard to sleep at all 

Till she crawls up in her bed 
Acting quiet as a mouse 
Deep inside, she's listening 
For a creaking in the house 
But no one's left to harm her 
She's finally safe and sound 
There's a peace she has found 

Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven 
Where did He go in the middle of her shame? 
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven 
She said His mercy is bringing her life again 
She's coming to life again 

He's in the middle of her pain, in the middle of her shame 
Mercy brings life 
He's in the middle 
Mercy in the middle

Is shining down on you

And the fruit that gives me strength to live
Is giving you strength too
Can we find a way to find a compromise

To leave a troubled past behind
To forget those angry words and wars we fought
Across the battle lines

Will follow what they see

For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing
Working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain.

Fire in the field
Underneath a blazing sun
But soon the sun was faded
And freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the holy One.

Lead me on
Lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into your keeping, oh.
Lead me on
Lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead on.

Waiting for the train
Labeled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding
Whispers in the dark
""Where are we going, is it very far?""

Bitter cold terrain
Echoes of a slamming door
In chambers made for sleeping, forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar
Cry to the Lord.

And we drown in the wake of our power

Amy Grant,"Laura loves her little family,
And she's the kind of woman who loves them with her life.
But sometimes in the evening,
When the world rests on her shoulders
With four walls closing in,
She'll close her eyes.

It's not like she misses being younger,
Though she never was in Vogue magazine or on TV,
Her husband loves her dearly,
And the morning shows her clearly,
Kisses her little baby girl.
Laura, she's the queen of the world.

Can't imagine ever leaving now,
Now that she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
Listen to her quiet heart singing loud.
Laura, she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
I know that she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
Saved by love.

There's nothing quite like my family's love to warm me,
And nothing short of death's gonna ever leave me cold.
Well, still at times it's lonely,
But through it all it only
Makes me love Jesus more,
And this is what He came here for.

I can't imagine ever leaving now.
Now that I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
He's gone and turned my crazy world back around,
And I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.

Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring

To kiss and to spoon

In a mothers tears in the dead of night
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.
God loves a drunkards cry,
The soldiers plea not to let him die
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.

We pour out our miseries
God just hears a melody
Beautiful the mess we are
The honest cries of breaking hearts
Are better than a Hallelujah.

The woman holding on for life,
The dying man giving up the fight
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes
The tears of shame for what's been done,
The silence when the words won't come
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes.

Contemplatin' why nothin' turns out right.

No desert too barren to cross

My loves so professional, just because were kissin' don't mean were undressin', no.
You ain't creepin' and suggestin' those freaky little things we could do cause the answers no.
Baby I got let u know, if and when the time comes for me nd you sex is slow.
Wrap it up cuz I aint carryin' your embreyo,
Your starin' at a women that would slap your ass to the fall.
You say I ain't right but you keep comin' back cause this girl is tight,
You ain't spendin' the night, uh uh after were done here its back to the wife.
Yeah I know it feels so nice, swing by for some love and then
Its so special all you get to get is just a touch.

[Chorus]

My loves on overload,
Don't mean to boast but a kiss would make you overdose.
Hold me tight, hold me close, turn out the lights,
Knock you out, boy your comatose
Boy your rockin' with the most, Estelle take you on a ride like a roller-coaster.
I heat it up like a toaste, boy bring your body over, I know what to do,
Lay it down put the zoom zoom on you, you try'na play it cool,
You know you want it true like a baby do, come on,
Boy am through with you, get your shoes on cause am using you
Because its so special all you get to get is just a touch.

[Chorus: x2]",Walking on a Word,2002
Amy LaVere,"You can't keep me here 
Against my will 
I didn't sign up for this 
I didn't break my bill 

You can't make me stay 
I'm not your pet 
I'm gonna break the chain you have tied around my neck 

I'm stomping out of here 
I hope the dishes rattle down off your shelf 
And if I see you first 
I'll run like hell 

Cause I don't need any kind of heartbreak resume 
This ain't the only trick I know despite what you may say 

You can't trick me back 
You can keep the change 
It isn't and will never be enough 
To pay this debt of shame 

I'm stomping out of here 
I hope the dishes rattle down 
I feel ashamed 
And if I see you first I'll run like hell 

You can't keep me here 
Against my will 
I didn't sign up for this 
I didn't break my bill 

I'm stomping out of here 
I hope the rain comes pouring down 
Through your roof 
Another breakup 
It's nothing new",You Can't Keep Me,2011
Amy Lee,"I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
I want to hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well
I want to hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you've gone away
You've gone away
You don't feel me here anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I want to hold you high, and steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I want to hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

Amy Lee,"Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me from me
Life's gotta always be messing with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feeling like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

So! Something on the, dum na ema

Amy Lee,"Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isn't any other stair quite like it
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top
So this is the stair where I always stop

Halfway up the stairs isn't up and isn't down
It isn't in the nursery, it isn't in the town
And all sorts of funny thoughts they run through my head
It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead

Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isn't any other stair quite like it
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top
So this is the stair where I always stop",Halfway Down the Stairs,2011
