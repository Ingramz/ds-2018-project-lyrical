Nat Su Quartet,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1997
Nat W. Finston & His Orchestra,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

Me suis reveillée vieillie
Pourtant j'etais trés belle
Oui j'etais la plus belle
Des fleurs de ton jardin

On est bien peu de choses
Et mon amie la rose me l'a dit ce matin
Vois le dieu qui m'a faite
M'a fait courber la tête

Et je sens que je tombe
Et je sens que je tombe mon coeur
Est presque nu j'ai le pied dans la tombe
Déjà je ne suis plus
Tu m'admirais que hier et je serais poussière

Et mon amie la rose est morte ce matin
La lune cette nuit, a veillé mon amie

Bien-au délà du nu
Et qui me souriait
Croit celui qui peut croire
Moi j'ai besoin d'espoir
Sinon je ne suis rien

When the western skies of a broken dawn
In the first embrace of a haunted smile
With the hopeful eyes of an alien child

I was taken by the hand from the ocean to the sand
From the half-light to the day

I have come to find my way

In the burning sheets of a neighbor's pain
With the sweat of a night and the summer rain
In the cry of birth and the death of fear
For the hope of a light and the joy of tears

From the tear-stained face of a haunted kind

Natacha Atlas,"(James Brown sample) ""This is a Man's World!""

Verse 1:
Lies and rumors, money and hoes
it's the World that I'm attached to, the World that I know
influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?
for the paper Nature takes it too far, perfectionist
rep the bridge, where everything's foul except the kids
we get it on, and contradict livin' long
though the clock will still tic when you gone.

Chorus
(This is a Man's World!)
Now if you a Man be a Man (you need a plan)
if you fall (I'ma put you on your feet again)
when you starve (I'ma show you how to eat again)
and through it all (I'll show you how to be a friend)
now when you in charge be in charge (you need a squad)
if you bored (I'ma show you how to be involved)
I give 'em more (niggas know they can't see the God)
I can't believe it God (I gotta eat or starve)

Verse 2:
Keep the livest image, high percentage
Four in the mornin', 
niggas blitzin' on corners like the line of scrimmage
convicts turnin' confident
enter the phase of niggas and they feminine ways
love my Timberlands, cinnamon suede
bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot
wild niggas on the block look for more to recruit
gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed
It's been Twenty-somethin' years now,
I'm still lookin' for the same dream.

Chorus

Verse 3:
In my World police recognize names
know us niggas by the walk or the size of their chain
you know the motto
we live for today, there's no tomorrow
we're only makin' time for the hoes that swallow
fuck a role model, I need therapy
seven nights out the week I jump out my sleep breathin' heavily
keep my head up, only the strong survive
livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

This is a man's world

To take us over the road
Man made the train 
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electrolight

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing

Man make them happy
Cos man make them toys
And after man make everything

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

Till one dream appears and love is its name

Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on

For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

A song that I had only sang to just a few

And I will give to you, summer wine

Natalia Harris,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,

Sé que has dormido con esa mujer

Y cuida mi sueños mientras yo me duerma

Quiero escuchar el grito del silencio
Y congelar el tiempo hasta que vuelvas

Te esperaré, deseándote

Me arrancaste la vida

Donde el amor volvió a nacer

Ahí te esperaré

Eso no impide que este amor sea eterno
Que sin hablar digamos tantas cosas

Movie star hair and that black eye,
I can’t even notice it when you smile so hard through a heart felt lie,
Go kiss the liquor off his laugh,
Another suitcase full of cash,
Shiny apologies in a velvet box,
What a real good man.

We drive brand new cars and we light fine cigars,
We shine like small town stars through the best days of our lives,

We will walk right down the pavement,
I know we’re gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

Another fist, another wall,
We lose ourselves we lose it all,
I wrote him a hundred times,
Can you hear my heart through the prison bars?
The boys I kiss don’t know my name,
The tears I cry all taste of blame,
Bad luck and dirty cops,
I’m a fucking teenage tragedy,

I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams,
So hold on before you see that you’re better off without me,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I’m gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

There’s a rainbow on the bathroom door again,
Where the lipstick slides and the pearls all fly oh.
I’m gone and I ain’t coming back this time,
I’m gonna find my home underneath the city lights oh.

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse,
Right out the hole in my fur coat,
Straight down the gutter goes my antidote to a broken girl,
I promise I’ll be the one you want,
Don’t tell me I’m unfixable,
You don’t know what it’s like to be seventeen with no place to go,

But give me just one night and I’ll be almost fine,
Remind me one more time it’s the best days of my life,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I'm gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

'Cause they got you baby, 
'Cause they got you babe. 
Heaven must be beautiful right now, 
'Cause they got you baby.
'Cause they got you babe. 

Yesterday you where in front of me,
Woke up this morning,
All of a sudden you're a memory.
Oh, if life is as short as they say it is, 
I guess we'll meet again sooner than we think we will.

I thought if I looked around you'd always be there,
And before I fall you'd pick me up and tell me keep believing.
My heart stopped beating soon as you stopped breathing,
I got on my knees and I don't care who sees me,
Heaven's gotta wait because I need you.

They say a picture says a thousand words,
But I would trade a thousand pictures to hear one of yours.
I'm not done saying prayers, 
Like I was writing your letters,
'Cause if heaven's far like I think it is,
You wouldn't get 'em.
So yeah, so this is just making it harder,
I can't just call you up and laugh with you, 
The way we used to.
Oh, this world isn't good enough, 
It don't deserve you.
'Cause you was an angel all along,
And now God returned you. 

And heaven must be beautiful right now, 
'Cause they got you baby, 
'Cause they got you babe. 
Heaven must be beautiful right now, 
'Cause they got you baby.
'Cause they got you.

They say that god is full of mysteries,
Sometimes I wonder if you tell him that you're missing me.
'Cause I miss you everyday,
Like they took someone away,
Like they took color away and it's grey,
Needs to get the hell away from me.

So much life loss, unnecessary, 
Street wars, world war,
Earth is only temporary.
Anger's only momentary.
Words replaces by weaponry,
We need to save the humans,
Save the future,
Stop our history becoming.

And I'm sorry.
Did I take you for granted?
But did I ever thank you?
I meant to every day.
Please don't say it's too late to pay homage.
Never called yourself a hero,
But you never disappointed me.

You think you're so in control, 
But boy we don't even know what's coming round.
I should be counting down my blessings,
Like I'm counting down seconds.
'Cause I can only say goodbye for now, for now.

I know heaven must be beautiful right now, 
'Cause they got you baby, 
'Cause they got you babe. 
I know heaven must be beautiful right now, 
'Cause they got you baby.

Boy it's just a little rain, no these ain't no tears
Every moment passed is a thousand years
Since you loved me…

And out of all the stupid boys I knew
I had to fall for you
And out of all the pretty lies you told
Can't one of them be true?

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.
No no no, this was not the plan,
If I can't have you then no one can.
When you wake up, I'll still be here outside
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.

Happy Hour ain't so happy when you got no friends
And who knew I'd find an angel at the gates of Hell?
Your glass was always empty, but your bed was full
When you loved me…
You gave me back my key, but you still have my heart
Are all the dreams of you and me in broken frames in your garbage?
The other guys with their honest eyes
Just can't love me…

And out of all the stupid boys I knew
I had to fall for you
And out of all the pretty lies you told
Can't one of them be true?

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.
No no no, this was not the plan,
If I can't have you then no one can.
When you wake up, I'll still be here outside
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.

Loving you is like a chainsaw to my heart,
But we're more beautiful with every single scar.
The words you promised, laying on the backseat of your car…
But like a bad, bad dream you leave me in the dark…

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.

Natalia Kills,"Momma you’re beautiful tonight,
Movie star hair and that black eye,
I can’t even notice it when you smile so hard through a heart felt lie,
Go kiss the liquor off his laugh,
Another suitcase full of cash,
Shiny apologies in a velvet box,
What a real good man.

We drive brand new cars and we light fine cigars,
We shine like small town stars through the best days of our lives,

We will walk right down the pavement,
I know we’re gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

Another fist, another wall,
We lose ourselves we lose it all,
I wrote him a hundred times,
Can you hear my heart through the prison bars?
The boys I kiss don’t know my name,
The tears I cry all taste of blame,
Bad luck and dirty cops,
I’m a fucking teenage tragedy,

I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams,
So hold on before you see that you’re better off without me,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I’m gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

There’s a rainbow on the bathroom door again,
Where the lipstick slides and the pearls all fly oh.
I’m gone and I ain’t coming back this time,
I’m gonna find my home underneath the city lights oh.

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse,
Right out the hole in my fur coat,
Straight down the gutter goes my antidote to a broken girl,
I promise I’ll be the one you want,
Don’t tell me I’m unfixable,
You don’t know what it’s like to be seventeen with no place to go,

But give me just one night and I’ll be almost fine,
Remind me one more time it’s the best days of my life,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I'm gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Cause it's just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Amarro mi vida a una moneda
Que gira en el aire para hacer

Algo mejor y estoy seguro

Acuerdo del pasado y no me

Que te puede pasar

Único que sé hacer, el monto
Se agranda la suerte me acompaña

Necesito más dinero
Para estar más placentero
De pronto mi sueño se va
Desmoronando todo lo

Que tengo se ha ido volando
De nuevo me encuentro
Sin un solo centavo
No sé por que me extraña
Sí así yo siempre acabo

Luego me maquillo y cuando yo camino la gente me mira insistente 
Cuando estoy contigo solo quiero nieve de fresas 

Soy una chica uso tacones de plástico 
Huele mi cuello es aroma de rosas y nuez 
Cuando llego a casa junto a la ventana puedo ver tu cara de lejos 
Cuando llego a casa miro como el día termina 

Y el espejo es toda la realidad 
Que triste entender como ellas no puedo ser 
Y el espejo nunca miente 
No puedo soltar mi labial

Lo malo es que me llamo Saul y el mundo yo lo vivo al revés

Natalia Lafourcade,"Es solo somos uno en un lugar
Un lugar pequeño donde solo hay
Verde, azul, café dolor solo tengo que esperar

Voy en bicicleta, venceré
Aunque estoy cansado, seguiré
Miles de personas hoy
No podrán sobrevivir!
No se pueden quejar, son un ser humano
No me puedo quejar, estoy condenado

La porción de un punto en el universo
Y los avanzados no nos quieren ver
Si me quejo de vivir
Solo tengo que esperar…
Mientras unos mueren, otros nacen
Mientras unos corren, otros duermen
Sueña la rutina diaria
Solo tienen que esperar

No se pueden quejar, son un ser humano
No me puedo quejar, estoy condenado

El altivo porte de una majestad
Sabes de los filtros que hay en el amor
Tienes el hechizo de la liviandad.

La divina magia de un atardecer
O la maravilla de la inspiración
Tienes en el ritmo de tu ser
Todo el palpitar de una canción
Y eres la razón de mí existir, mujer

Tienes en el ritmo de tu ser

Tú me haces caminar, distancias recorrer
Te puedo respirar, alimentas mi querer
También me haces llorar, mis lágrimas de miel

Natalia Lafourcade,"Llega tarde a casa con la bruma del mar
Llega con la rabia enroscada
Entra muy despacio para no secuestrar
El sueño más bonito que hay.

Sale de la niebla de un bostezo lunar
Descalzada y despeinada, corre
Corre hasta sus brazos como nadie lo hará
Jamás, jamás, jamás.

Y María le dice que sí,
Dice sonrojada que sí,
Y se esconde en sus brazos.

Y él contesta que todo irá bien
Que las flores volverán a crecer
Donde ahora lloramos.

Cae la madrugada mientras ella de pie
Mira con la chispa adecuada
Cara de emboscada
Cielo abierto a la vez
El piensa que bonita es.

Juntos y olvidados por el sueño se van
Contando adivinanzas
Hasta que la flor se va cerrando con él
Se va cerrando con él.

Y maría le dice, que si
Dice sonrojada que si
Y se esconde en sus brazos.

Y él contesta que todo irá bien
Que las flores volverán a crecer
Donde ahora lloramos.

Y el invierno llego y él se fue
Y cuentan que María sin él
No se mira en los charcos
Cada trece de Marzo a las diez
Ella espera verle otra vez
Pero él se ha marchado.

Es que no requiere de esfuerzos

Saludo al campo y me voy corriendo

Pero no más llorar

En las aves que amanecen
En sus cantos sus sonidos
Cómo alegran mis oídos

Escucho una orquesta de hojas en el cielo
Aplausos de piedras en el suelo
Y miro la tarde que me saluda
En mi luto de amor y nacimiento de luna

No más llorar
Sé que ya lo nuestro no tiene remedio
Pero no más llorar

Nunca imaginé que después de un tiempo acabaría sin paredes

Las noches llenas de comer, grabando esas canciones hasta el amanecer

¿Para qué tirar nuestras cartas y fotografías?
¿Para qué olvidar que antes de todos nuestros besos?
Fuimos como hermanos, fuimos como amigos con derechos

Nunca imagine que me casaría sin papeles
Nunca supe cómo hacer que fueras más feliz, te lo juro
Tenías que buscarte tú, tenía que salvarme yo
Teníamos que dejarlo ser e invento esta canción en el atardecer

Dueños sin saber cómo nos perdimos
Cómo dividimos lazos sin saber por qué

Que al menos no me dejes ir de tus brazos

Buscándote en cada rincón
Que extraño ese silencio, extraño que no llegues tú
Que no llegues tú, aunque ya amaneció

De lágrimas se aprende
Y lo que fallamos perdonar

Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing 
And they don't see it showing, why do I?

In a world where tears are just a lullaby 
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness 
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

Que se desangre la vida 
Ni verán llegar la situación a su fin
No tendrán lugar 
Hasta que sane la herida 
Ni se apagará la llama 
Que hay en mí

No caminaremos 
Por la ruta del llanto 
Ni nos venceremos 
Sin hallar la razón 
No nos quedaremos 
Sin salvar el encanto 
Ni se detendrá 
El camino al corazón 

Hey hey hey aún exite la ilusión 
Aún podemos empezar a sentir amor 

Y por eso canto, canto 
Porque quiero tanto, tanto 
Más entrega y menos llanto 
Y que brille un nuevo sol 

Y por eso canto, canto 
Porque quiero tanto, tanto 
Que se escuche al fin mi canto 
Y se alegre el corazón 

No nos rendiremos 
Al pasar de los años 
Ni nos detendremos 
Sin saber la verdad 
No nos perderemos 
En mentiras y engaños 
Ni traicionaremos 
Nuestra libertad

No descansaremos 
Hasta hallar la salida 
Ni le entregaremos 
La esperanza al dolor 
No nos venderemos 
Aunque sangre la herida 
Somos la semilla 
De un mundo mejor

Natalia Oreiro,"Te has pasado el tiempo 
Sin darte cuenta 
Que tienes a mis ojos quemándote 
Que tienes a mi boca 
Esperando alerta 
Y toda esta locura besándote 

Yo te doy la llave de mis caderas 
Para que tu entres sin preguntar 
Para que te ahogues 
Entre mis piernas 
Poder atraparte 
Y que no puedas escapar 

Porque me estoy cayendo 
En este amor bestial 
Controlo mis instintos 
Para que no huyas 
Para darte más 

Pide lo que quieras 
No des más vueltas 
Que tú eres el dueño 
De mi nación 
Puedo ser la geisha 
Con la que sueñas 
Puedo ser la gata de tu balcón 

Yo juego con fuego 
Y quiero quemarme 
En el firmamento de tu interior 
Quémate con fuego 
Ven a buscarme 
Porque estás logrando 
Que yo pierda el control 

Porque me estoy cayendo 
En este amor bestial 
Controlo mis instintos 
Para que no huyas 
Para darte más 

Porque me estoy ardiendo 
No lo puedo evitar 
Yo quiero ser tu dueña 
Ven a amarme ahora 
Deja de pensar",Cayendo,2002
Natalia Oreiro,"Cuesta caminar por la vereda, pinturita callejera 
Cuesta la desilusión 
Tanto salto de cabeza, trampolín a rienda suelta
La tristeza se quedó

Por el río que era plata, por lo tanto que hace falta
Cuesta desesperación
Cuesta la esperanza y nadie presta 
Cuesta ver a ciencia cierta, entre tanto calefón 
Mira lo que pocas pulgas, se reparte y se divulga 
La mentira se quedó

Cuesta arriba, cuesta abajo
Cuesta creer que no se puede cambiar 
Y cuesta ver una laguna en el mar

Owow, wow, wow
Se viene el agua, hay que ver a ver que pasa
Ay se viene el agua

Owow wow wow 
Y a ver que pasa, hay que ver a ver que pasa 
Ay se viene el agua

Cuesta como cuesta cuesta arriba
Caminar por la avenida, cuesta eterna voluntad 
Que la luna reaparezca, que entre tanta recompensa 
Entre tanto ventarrón

Cuesta arriba, cuesta abajo 
Cuesta creer que no se puede cambiar 
Y cuesta ver una laguna en el mar

Owow, wow, wow
Se viene el agua, hay que ver a ver que pasa

Natalia Oreiro,"Quiero escapar 
De tanto sufrimiento 
Y de tanto dolor

A buscar en cada espacio 
Dentro del corazón

Por el que pueda yo encontrar 
Tal vez alguna verdad 

No soporto un minuto más 
Cuando estás aquí 
Cuando estás allá 
No soporto un minuto más

Natalia Zukerman,"They say that bad things happen in three
I guess that means you and me
Are happening still

Once just for the thrill
Two times to make sure we get our fill
And a third despite our best intentions

If youth is wasted on the young
Then you and I have just begun 
To be wasted

Poetry looking for clarity 
Or clarity looking for poetry
Despite our better judgement

You are taking me
Out of my reality
And I’m not sure
If I like it

You can't stop the morning rain
Form banging against my window pane
And bathing everything in a grey light

Like a moth to a flame

And left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same
Oh baby no
When I looked into your eyes
The moment that I let you go I just broke down (down)

Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice
'Cause the feelin that I feel within no other man
Would ever make me feel so right

It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me
Right next to me
And I miss the way you hold me in your tight

I've got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I've gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world for you
I'd do anything

That's right baby
I'm goin' crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you (baby)

That's right baby
I'm goin' crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me

Break it down now I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you it's been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak
Can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me
And you want me
And you miss me
And you love me
I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you
Put it down be the woman for you
I'm falling so deep for you
Crazy over you I'm calling
Callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true no frontin'
It's you ain't no other
I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (down)

Natalie,"Ever since the day you went away
And left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same
Oh baby no
When I looked into your eyes
The moment that I let you go I just broke down (down)

Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice
'Cause the feelin that I feel within no other man
Would ever make me feel so right

It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me
Right next to me
And I miss the way you hold me in your tight

I've got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I've gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world for you
I'd do anything

That's right baby
I'm goin' crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you (baby)

That's right baby
I'm goin' crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you (baby)

Break it down now I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you it's been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak
Can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me
And you want me
And you miss me
And you love me
I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you
Put it down be the woman for you
I'm falling so deep for you
Crazy over you I'm calling
Callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true no frontin'
It's you ain't no other
I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (down)

I've got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I've gotta let you know I think that we are destiny

This emptiness that I feel, is going to be here a while.
Feeling kinda strange, now that you're away baby.
This emptiness that I feel, really just ain't my style.
Even though it hurts, gotta make it work baby.

It's hard to believe, you're not here with me.
Where will I go, where will I be
Lost without you, you are my dreams
Better move on, as hard as it seems
I try to tell myself forget the past
I think that I'm losing my mind
Because you ain't coming back
I gotta play it right, keep it cool, keep control
I'm trying all this time to let you go

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you

And I need you
I really gotta have you

Your love has me blind, I can't even think
It's in me a while, then it will leave
And then I will move on, this really ain't me
Whatever am I going to do?
You got me stressing over losing you
I gotta keep it right, keep it cool, keep control
I'm trying all this time to let you go

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you

This emptyness and the way you makin' me feel
Is it real? Do I want to continue loving you still?
Here's the deal, do I hang on to something that's been killed
Or move on, stay strong and continue to walk up heel
But I will, always on memories in my mind
But until, that's going to take all of me over time
To unwind, to forget about what we had in our lives
I was blind before, but now you're gone I'll be fine

Make me say ""Oh boy""
Oh boy

Now how da hell you get a playa
So electrified
Is that a dance you do
Or an exercise
Baby take me to a place
Where my spirits run free
Dance like we in france mama
Ooh-wee-wee, yeah

You the type of chick who loves
Skirts and high heels
I'm the type of cat
Who like throwin' dolla bills
Ain't no trouble when we bubble
Fly like a breeze
You can beat the geneses
I'ma be ya lemon squeeze

I'm so bubbalicious and so delicious
You can't resist it
Now can we kick it out, mah friend?

Your so super natural
When you dancing on da pole
Make me say ""Oh boy""
Oh boy

All of my life


Can somebody tell me why
These chicks keep falling for the same guy
It's been going on for a while now
I'm feeling so much more
I'm trying really hard
But I can't stop from crying
What do I do
I'm falling in love
If I'm not I'd be lying
Why am I hanging on
To such a memory
Too strong that I can't let go even though I'm trying
With the happiness
You're telling me when we will ever be what we used to be again

All of my life
I've waited for someone like you
I feel it when I look at you
In your eyes I see the truth
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I'm missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

All of my life
I'll give you everything you'll ever need
Always be a part of me
You're the reason that I breathe
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I keep missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

Now tell me what am I gonna do
Can't escape right 'cause I think of you
I close my eyes, I see your face, makes me alone
Just make me wanna take a breath and take it
It's a rush
Flashbacks dreaming about the both of us
Do I really wanna wake up
Oh no 'cause when I do you're not with me
That's when reality hits me
I get weak in the knees, can't function me
No, can't breathe
My friends see changes in me
Always be dremaing if once be
If still today be a part of a heart, always will be
Your beautiful soul and smile is all I need

All of my life
I've waited for someone like you
I feel it when I look at you
In your eyes I see the truth
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I'm missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

All of my life
I'll give you everything you'll ever need
Always be a part of me
You're the reason that I breathe
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I keep missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

My mind has been so tired
I have no words to say (no words to say)
I'm feelin' so frustrated
I wish I could walk away (I should walk away)
So now what am I supposed to do
Without you here with me
I'm going in and out
I'm feelin up and down
So baby hear when I say

All of my life
I've waited for someone like you
I feel it when I look at you
In your eyes I see the truth
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I'm missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

All of my life
I'll give you everything you'll ever need
Always be a part of me
You're the reason that I breathe

I know I deserve better 
I just wanna earn cheddar 
I wish I'd learn never trust what I say when I burn letters of love 
You used to write me telling how much you like me and like me 
I could see you as my wifey 
You show a dark sign like the night the moon covers 
Guess you'd never known 'til they show the true colors 
A few of us pay no attention and let it flow 
But not me, baby, I'm sorry you gotta go 
It's taking us toll 
You kinda breakin' my soul 
It's like I'm sitting in a desert and I'm waitin' for it to snow

I want to know who you are but you seem very nice
So will you talk to me?
Should I tell you a story? Should I tell you a treat?
They think I'm crazy, They don't understand how I feel

See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her
The name of my record company, (Oh your a sanger)
I said my name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer
(Oh you that guy they talking bout when they be whisperin, ain't cha
Bring your name up when they talking and say money will change ya
I heard a lot about how you can't deal with your anger
Heard the rumors how your always in trouble or danger
Not gotta judge you if it's true, there's no need to explain sir
You do have a right to be, you seem like your nice to me
And like your gonna buy me another drink, yeah would you like a seat?)
I tell the boy the same hennessey on ice for me
Her drink starts emptying as she's pouring out her life to me
Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be
And invite me to a session of her life and she
Seems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me
She pulls out her picture phone ""I got pictures, would you like to see?""
I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell
Giving a soul to me, it's like an identity sell
We never met is the story that my memory tells
Telling me tales like she doesn't handle hennessey well
Getting into it, getting intimate and into details
See, I just met you and you showing me your kids
""Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids""
Then who's in this picture, ""Man, let you show you just who it is""

[Chorus]

Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel
She wasn't from here, I knew she didn't hang a
Round a part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger
Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see
She said she wasn't married but the rings on her finger
Told me she was langin and using the same uhh
Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her
Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her
(I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you
He told me about the loyalty and love he used to show you
He said what he said with a passion like it was so true
Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners didn't really know you)
There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you
She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around
I find that photo, I'm like ""Oh no there's some trouble in town""
I turn around as these two officers is coming in now
They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down
So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground
So close that they can listen to either of us now
We turn back around and she says no need for whispering
Then she tells me that (I don't really give a damn whose listening
Try to make it last a long time was my mission
And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him
Hit 'em with my fist and my punches were never missing him)

[Chorus]

Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now
You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud
And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how
It wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile
She said (pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul
Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile's power
Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour
So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower)
Damn what do you mean? ( couldn't tell you that I missin him)
I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him?
She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him
She stops, Ay keep talkin I'm listening
(I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing)
Henny spilling then she tell me (For real and
I got the feeling of what I'm feeling is that I wanted to kill him)
Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villian
The poison's getting louder, the moral is getting clearer
The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her
Told me (It was protection, Reached for it in the stash)
The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass
Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at least
Baby I think you crazy, Sorry I'm pressing for time
I gotta go grind, time's putting to resting
Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing
That this conversation is two types of evil confession
And she pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend
How you know him? She told me she was with him at his house
Watching movies on Sundays when they be chilling
And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him
The feeling was the worst feeling that she could possibly be feeling
Stood up and then I yelled out ""Why in the hell did you kill him?""
I didn't kill him, I have AIDS, he had sex with 'em and that's crazy",Think I'm Crazy,2005

We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win

You worry too much
Its going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below

And whatever may go

Tried hard to settle down

So many men no-one needs

And what I`m going through is hard

Chorus:
You make me feel
The way that a woman should feel
You give the kind of love that is real
Yes, I sense it inside
You make me feel
So complete, it's right
And I wanna love you for life
Yes, you make me feel

V1
From the first day that we met
I knew we were meant for each other
And now I can't imagine
Being with any other
You came into my world, so unexpectedly
I never thought I'd find someone
Who I could love for eternity
You put your hand in mine
I love that you can read my mind
Anticipate my every need
With you I wanna be

V2
It wasn't so long ago
That I felt unloved and alone
You walked into my life
A bright star to give me light
You give the respect that I need
Baby, I feel like your queen
Seems when we're together
Time is still, we are in heaven
The things you do for me
So precious and so sweet
Ecstasy is what I feel
When it's you and me

Bridge:
Yes, when you're with me
I feel that I can do anything
Baby, when you kiss me
I feel the way that a woman should feel



",You Make Me Feel,2000
Natalie Browne,"Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do!

So I cry, I pray and I beg

Love me love me
Say that you love me
Fool me fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me
Love me love me
Say that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you

Lately I have desperately pondered,
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry, and I pray for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you

Anything but you

Give me a spark to get the fire burning

Can't get enough, hot wire me
Satisfy me, don't give me up

Though I think I really know you

And you think you know me

And we're as close at two people

Could ever hope to be

Still I can't escape the feeling

That no matter what I do

I'll never understand what it feels like to be you

I get the urge to know you better

To make our spirits one

I want to see us be together

As close as we can come

I get the urge to merge

I get the urge to merge with you

I get the urge to merge

I get the urge to merge with you

Have you ever wanted something

You just had to possess

And it turned into obsession

And wouldn't let you rest

There are times I can't help wishing

I could melt right into you

Hear every word you're thinking

Feel everything you do

I feel trapped inside my body

And there's nothing I can do

Want to leap across the wall

That's keeping me from you

To break what can't be broken

To say what can't be spoken

If only for a moment

To touch your soul

I get the urge to know you better




",The Urge to Merge,1987

Then I'd wake up and we're still apart

Someone's invading my dream.
We were sailing along,
So peaceful and calm,

Someone's rocking my dreamboat,
Disturbing our beautiful dream.

This mutiny at sea,
Who can it be?

To a paradise of our own.
All at once a storm blew us apart
And left me drifting alone.

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..",Lush Life,1991

And when the times get tough
And ? don?t even have enough for a card to send
Well you can always do the best that you can

So I bring you a song for Christmas
May love be with us in our hearts 
And may joy and true happiness take part

And though I?ve had my doubts
Maybe that ray of hope can come shinin? through
And this old world can be a better place for me and you

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996

Every man would have a friend

That right would always win
And love would never end

What is this illusion called

The innocence of youth
Maybe only in their blind belief
Can we ever find the truth
There'd be no more lives torn apart
And wars would never start

And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
And right would always win

They betray with their eyes

Is it just in a kiss
That their fences turn to dust in a kiss
Ooh they must in a kiss
Promise their tomorrows

Changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time

Natalie Cole,"Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies

Well, I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself
But for our world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

Every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called?
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

There'd be no more lives torn apart
And wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

Every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

This is my grown-up Christmas wish
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown-up Christmas list

Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.

Of under-rated treasures

Oh, but I think about you everyday
And it makes me weak when I see your face

Cause I wanna love again and this time with you

I want to love again but I'm afraid to
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to

When much to my surprise

And it ain't nothing new

It's a game that we all play
And the prize that we pay
Is sometimes much too high

On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

""Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""

""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.""
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted

Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; 
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign. 
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed 
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ. 

Angels and archangels may have gathered there, 
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; 
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss, 
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

Natalie Cortez,"So excited 
Because I'm gonna go to the High School of Performing Arts. 
I mean, I was dying to be a serious actress. 
Anyway, it's the first day of acting class 
And we're in the auditorium, and the teacher, 
Mr. Karp, puts us up on the stage with our legs around everybody
One in back of the other. And he says, 
""Okay, we're gonna do improvisations. 
Now, you're on a bob sled 
And it's snowing out and it's cold. 
Okay, go!""

Ev'ry day for a week we would try to feel the motion, 
Feel the motion down the hill.
Ev'ry day for a week we would try to hear the wind rush, 
Hear the wind rush, feel the chill.

And I dug right down to the bottom 
Of my soul to see what I had inside.
Yes, I dug right down to the bottom 
Of my soul and I tried, I tried.

Everyone is going ""Woosh I feel the snow, 
I feel the cold I feel the air."" 
And Mr. Karp turns to me and says,
""Okay, Morales, what did you feel ""

And I said, ""Nothing, I'm feeling nothing,""
And he says, ""Nothing could get a girl transferred!""
They all felt something, but I felt nothing
Except the feeling that this bullshit was absurd!

But I said to myself,
""Hey!, it's only the first week. Maybe it's genetic.
They don't have bob sleds in San Juan.""

Second week, more advanced 
And we had to be a table, be a sports car ice cream cone.
Mr. Karp, he would say, 
""Very good, except Morales. 
Try, Morales, all alone.""

So I dug right down to the bottom 
Of my soul to see how an ice cream felt.
Yes, I dug right down to the bottom 
Of my soul and I tried to melt.
The kids yelled, ""Nothing!"" 
They called me ""Nothing!"" 
And Karp allowed it, which really makes me burn.
They were so helpful. 
They called me hopeless. 
Until I really didn't know where else to turn!

And Karp kept saying, 
""Morales, I think you should transfer to girls' high. 
You'll never be an actress. Never! Jesus Christ!

Went to church praying, 
""Santa Maria, send me guidance, send me guidance."" 
On my knees.
Went to church praying, 
""Santa Maria, help me feel it, 
Help me feel it. Pretty please.""

And a voice from down at the bottom 
Of my soul cam up to the top of my head.
And the voice from down at the bottom of my soul, 
Here is what it said

""This man is nothing! 
This course is nothing! 
If you want something, go find a better class.
And when you find one, you'll be an actress."" 
And I assure you that's what fin'lly came to pass.

Six months later I heard that Karp had died.
So I dug right down to the bottom of my soul and cried,
'cause I felt nothing.

They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

It's amazing that the soldiers somehow all know how to dance
It's amazing how the soldiers keep the creases in their pants
Now it's safe to walk the streets at night; a new world has begun
Everybody's sleeping soundly thanks to 1081",Order 1081,2014

Natalie Duncan,"Where are all the flowers?
Did they wilt and shrivel inside me, 
To blend with the leather skin I wear
That masks the tar covered streets.

Where do they all go?
Winding like ribbon silk
That old tarmac tapestry, 
That covers every one of our sins.
And I walked a long way home, 
Left behind a faded smile.
And walked right into the emptiness of my home, 
It covered up my cheeks.
And I sat in silence, 
Conversations in my ears.
I'm looking back on the happy returns
Of my birthday card years.

Hold out your hands together.
I don't need you here forever.
Just someone right now
To hold me 'cause I'm broken.
Then you can go and leave me, 
In uncomfortable silence.

Wearing out my shoes, treading over diamonds.
Ones that pave these broken streets, 
Ones that carry my dead weight.
Now my bed sheets look presentable.
And I feel the electric fire's orange glow
And I remember all the drunken promises made.
They lie shattered on the floor.
And I sit here wanting more.

Hold out your hands together.
I don't need you here forever.
Oh I, Just someone right now
To hold me 'cause I'm broken.
Then you can go and leave me.
In uncomfortable silence.

Underneath my cloudy bloom.
Where the tower blocks, 
They cover up my moon.
I'm so wrapped in your love, 
Like a baby kicking in it's womb
Oh and you give me the blues
Every time you leave the room.

Ooh I
Ooh I

What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?

Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?

In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!

Hiding my heartache, will this glass house break
How much will they take before I'm empty
Do I let it show, does anybody know?

But You see the real me
Hiding in my skin, broken from within
Unveil me completely
I'm loosening my grasp
There's no need to mask my frailty
'Cause You see the real me

Painted on, life is behind a mask
Self-inflicted circus clown
I'm tired of the song and dance
Living a charade, always on parade
What a mess I've made of my existence
But You love me even now
And still I see somehow

But You see the real me
Hiding in my skin, broken from within
Unveil me completely
I'm loosening my grasp
There's no need to mask my frailty
'Cause You see the real me

Wonderful, beautiful is what You see
When You look at me
You're turning the tattered fabric of my life into
A perfect tapestry
I just wanna be me

But You see the real me
Hiding in my skin, broken from within
Unveil me completely
I'm loosening my grasp
There's no need to mask my frailty
'Cause You see the real me

And You love me just as I am

Wonderful, beautiful is what You see
When You look at me",The Real Me,2005
Natalie Grant,"This is a song for anyone whose ever been
Knocked down and can't get back again
Stuck in the corner, can't move forward
All alone and you think you're going nowhere

And felt so small, two feet tall and so out of place

You say you're gonna start right now
What are you waiting for
It only takes once voice
So come on now and shout it out
Give a little more
What are you waiting for

Sometimes I feel a little helpless
Seems like I can't do a thing
But anything is possible just you wait and see
Good things happen if you just believe

Natalie Grant,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by,
Yet in thy dark streets shine'th
The everlasting Light,
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild,
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray,
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell,
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2006

He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
'Til on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live, I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Is sinking sand, is sinking sand

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Wild at heart and following her dreams

Where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine
It was only but it would lead the way
To the door of a man where she'd throw it all away

See her vision had long died
Along with all her pride
When she found herself at the end of her road
She heard angels through the doors
Of a church she'd passed a million times before
Inside the choirs song was ringing
Since she'd found herself believing
Out there maybe there was something more

And so she bowed her head to pray
She cried Jesus please make a way
And she heard Him say

I'll make a way

Natalie Grant,"A seed, it grows and somehow becomes a life
It moves, she knows that her Baby has arrived
She's so scared, but she's so blessed
She lays down her fear for the hope at her breast for she knows

One million chains could never hold back this moment in time
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means
Heaven and earth, they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world

He stands beside her, he'd share her pain if he only knew how
He whispers, ""I love you"" as he gently strokes her brow
He's so scared, but he's so blessed
There's a thundering pride pounding deep in his chest
For he knows

One million chains could never hold back this moment in time
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means
Heaven and earth, they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world

Christ is born, we are blessed
Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess
That we know

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say, ""Cuckoo""
Regretfully they tell us but firmly they compel us
To say goodbye to you

So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye, goodbye

I'm glad to go, I cannot tell a lie
I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly
The sun has gone to bed and so must I

So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Natalie Hall,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips


And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

Sleeping in the small world head in the sand 
Better wash your hands , make a new plan 
There's more important things 
Than making sure your shoes just walk right 
Ignore reality there's nothing you can do about it
The clothes you wear don't make the man 
It's just another party

And place it in my pocket

I'll take a breath
And cradle your sweet head
Should've stayed at home in bed
Put that face away
I'm melting for you
I know, I get cold
'cause I can't leave things well alone
Understand I'm accident prone
Me, I get free
Every night the moon is mine
But when the morning comes
Don't say you love me
Don't say you need me
I really don't think that's fair
Boy I'm not so dumb
But when you leave me
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there
I dreamt about another girl in bed with you
You just laughed and smiled
Denied the proof
We're fine till I think of the problem
I wish it made sense
Like a joke that no one gets
It's a life without regret
I want it to feel that way, forever and ever

Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.
Haven't I learned,
People get hurt,
When they go diving in the deep end
In the deep end,
In the deep end,
In the deep end.
Thought I was smart,
Controlling the art, of turning off my intuition
Haven't I seen, since I was fourteen.
That life is all just repitition
You lose or you win,
You sink or you swim,
When you go diving in the deep end,
In the deep end,
In the deep end,
In the deep end.

You don't have to agonise
You don't have to compromise
But the one thing you must do
Is open your eyes
Your eyes,
Your eyes.

When they go diving,

Fragile in spirit
Like a wind blowin' wild

Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time

Find somewhere safe to land
Before your walls were shaken
But now the whole thing's brakin'

Cause I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking into my appetite
Tomorrow morning
Are you a friend of mine

I swear, you've left me open
Nowhere, to hide this moment
Overcrowded daydreams
We're lost or so it seems

About our world tonight

Natalie Imbruglia,"Sit down
Wait a minute
I thought we were special
This town and everyone in it
Moves a little faster than the underground

No time and time is money
Feeling like a piece of machinery
Let down when I say you tumble
Falling over pieces of me

I want to be your sanctuary
Set you free
Set you free
I want to be your sanctuary
Set you free
Set you free

Foot down
Turn it around
Don't even know where I want to go
No sound and tunnel vision
All I need is you on the radio

No time and time is money
Weaving through the traffic to cross the street
Blues skies
Now you're talking
Gotta get the shoes off my feet

I want to be your sanctuary
Set you free
Set you free
I want to be your sanctuary
Set you free
Set you free

I want to lead you and follow you
I want to hold you and keep it true
So many things that I want to do with you

Last night under the light
I thought we were special
Your smile danced for a while
I'm here to help you to keep it
To keep it
To keep it

No chance of sinking sailing ships
If time stood still
I'd take aim and fire for you

For every ocean there must be shore
On which I'll stand with restless toes
When everything I look for in myself
Is in you

I feel a little more than empty
But I want to feel more than full

It's a pity all I have
Is just enough to keep you satisfied

No matter how we try to keep it tied

You may be drinking way too much
If I had the strength to take the weight off you
I would

Something that keeps us together
You keep me dry despite the weather

Lie and say that things are fine
And hide that empty longing that you feel
Don't ever show it, just keep your heart concealed

Why are the days so lonely?
I wonder where, where can a heart go free
And who will dry the tears that no one's seen?
There must be someone to share your silent dreams

Caught like a leaf in the wind
Lookin' for a friend, where can you turn?
Whisper the words of a prayer and you'll find Him there
Arms open wide, love in His eyes

Jesus, He meets you where you are
Jesus, He heals your secret scars
All the love you're longing for
Is Jesus, the friend of a wounded heart

Joy comes like the the morning
And hope deepens as you grow
And peace, beyond the reaches of your soul
Comes blowing through you, for love has made you whole

Once like a leaf in the wind
Looking for a friend, where could you turn?
You spoke the words of a prayer and you found Him there
Arms open wide, love in His eyes

Lived a man, who sailed the sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006
Natalie Maines,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Natalie Maines,"Well, you are still here
And I am still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
You went a semester to West Texas State
But the freshmen fifteen you gained
Killed all your dates
I guess I still love you if I ever did
And I can see myself having a couple of kids
And we will get by
For the rest of our lives

So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin

Well, I am still here
And you are still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
Though weight's not an issue you have gained more
And when I said I do well I slammed all the doors
To a future where I could see Paris in spring
And I wasn't prepared for the weight of this ring
But we will get by
For the rest of our lives

So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin

So play some old BTO
For my friends don't you know
Keep your dogs in the truck

Get out the wieners and buns
Cause the briskets all gone
At our wedding in suburban Seguin

We'll raise our ready hands and let go for the ride

With nowhere much to go and nothing much to do

When I'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it

Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come

It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever

I'll fly when you cry
Lift us out of this landslide
Wherever you are
Whenever we part

I'll keep on healing all the scars
That we've collected from the start
I'd rather this than live without you
For every wish upon a star
That goes unanswered in the dark
There is a dream, I've dreamt about you

And from afar, I lie awake
Close my eyes to find I'd never be the same

I'll shine when you shine
Painted pictures on my mind
Sun sets on this ocean
Never once on my devotion
However you are
Or far that you fall

I'll keep on healing all the scars
That we've collected from the start
I'd rather this than live without you
For every wish upon a star
That goes unanswered in the dark
There is a dream, I've dreamt about you

And from afar, I lie awake
Close my eyes to find I'd never be the same
Without you, without you",Without You,2013
Natalie Maines,"Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb

Mother do you think they'll like the song

Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls
Ooh ah, mother should I build a wall
Mother should I run for president
Mother should I trust the government
Mama will they put me in the firing line
Ooh ah, is it it just a waste of time
Hush now baby baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama will keep baby cozy and warm
Ooh babe
Ooh babe
Ooh babe of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother do think she's good enough
For me
Mother do think she's dangerous
To me
Mother will she tear your little boy apart
Ooh ah, mother will she break my heart
Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up till you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

Ooh baby
Ooh baby
Ooh baby
You'll always be a baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high",Mother,2013
Natalie Mandoza,"The French are glad to die for love
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girls best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you feed your pompus cat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Tiffany!
Cartie!
Cause we are living in a material world and I am a material girl
Ah come and get me boys ow!
Black star, rozz call talk to me harry siblez, tell me all about it!
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a heart-boiled employer thinks you're awful nice
Get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy when stakes are high but beware when they start to descend
Ooh, diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Lets make love
Yes! Yes! Tiger! Oh everything was going so well! (screams)
Cause that's when those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best,  friend",Sparkling Diamonds,2002
