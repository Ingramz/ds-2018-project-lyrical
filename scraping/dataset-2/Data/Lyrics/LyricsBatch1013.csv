Six Feet Under,"Murdered in the basement, blood stains on cement
Murdered in the basement, a hammer to the head
Murdered in the basement, something's rotten in the cellar
Murdered in the basement, don't go down there!

I hate your fucking guts, your world makes me sick
Tell me what to do, I got a special place for you
Murdered in the basement, in concrete grave
Murdered in the basement, an ice pick to the face

Murdered in the basement, something's rotten in the cellar
Murdered in the basement, don't go down there
I hate your fucking guts, your world makes me sick
Tell me what to do, I got a special place for you

Buried in a concrete grave after you re dismembered and raped
A skeletons hand shoved up your ass
Food for the worms and rats
Murdered in the basement, time to dig a hole

Murdered in the basement, lyme to cover the smell
Murdered in the basement, something's rotten in the cellar
Murdered in the basement, don't go down there
Murdered in the basement, an 8th hole in your head

Murdered in the basement, killing for revenge
Murdered in the basement, a knife stuck in my back
Murdered in the basement, food for the worms and rats
I hate your fucking guts, your world makes me sick

I'm in the shadows close, so close I've almost got you
Doomed to the end dead from the beginning
That's right hear what the fuck I'm saying
I can't think straight I'm gonna break, break down
You can't escape you re gonna die slow now
It's all a part of my master plan
Everyone ends up dead in the end
Hell yeah
What the fuck you gonna do now, huh?- pray to a God that isn't there? No
Fall to your knees and die for me- I have the cure for your Christian disease
I live this life to kill, homicidal

I closed my eyes and then I kill- kill- kill
When I woke up they were all fucking dead!
You are so ugly you deserve to die- you deserved to die

Crawl inside that ugly brain of yours and I ll get inside my ugly brain

We dig our own grave, a twist of the blade- I ll dig your grave

Flow through your life then you drop

The very blood that runs through you
It's time to die when your skin turns blue
Your skin turned blue you breathed your last breath
Rotten in the crypt is your next step
Friend with the maggots in your head
Bleed again and again- die you re dead

In my mind numb inside my head

Slit wrists, this knife, these veins
This sickness has been growing inside of me
This rage, my evil, your fear
Near death

Fuck a bitch don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up
Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas paid for hoes, just to lay with hoes
Relax one night, and paid to stay with hoes
Captain Save'em all day, well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches off of the grip
You punk bitch

When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby, hit the bong
While the west coast rolls along
While we still making gangsta hits
You'll be still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl, you think you're slick
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch

I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your sixty-four, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimpin repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts

Just so that you can get a look at us
And figure out if we're worth you paid.

Too many bands to depened.

Because there's too many people watching me

You're gonna feel my pain, like it or not

And you are one of mine

A simple rhythm I forgot how to play
I want to tell you 
That I've called off the dogs

For the blessed ring
Like a holy grail

Like a metronome
Rhythm for my brain
And its ceaseless scares
I never seem to play them to the beat I hear
Though my heart beat is a beat
That beats so near

So we had a talk last night
About the heavy blow that you dealt in fight
Your back against the wall
It was a puzzle piece
Important to the whole that I may not find
You placed within the hole
I never seem to put them in the gaps I see
Like a puzzle where the pieces lost you and me

'cause what I am's not good
And I know you love me now
But I don't see why you should
And I don't see why you should
No I don't see why you should

So I drift into the end like a moth to light
Down the boulevard to a coffee shop
In the land of song
In the land of wait
Beat is bearing down on this lonely town
I never seem to write them down as good as you
Like I some where lost the keys that let me in

Sixwire,"Every guy in my country road home town,
Lost their mind when this one girl came around.
Oh, I was seventeen,
The first time that she looked my way.
Hot as the pavement in July.
Started somethin' in my mind.

An' it goes like this.
That girl has got a thunderstorm of love down inside her.
When we kiss,
Nothin' in the world can take me higher:
There's just one way to describe her,
And it goes like this.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
When it's right love don't care just where it spawns.
That girl and I went all the way a ringin' on, yeah.
Now every night, it's just as good as that first time.
She's somethin' that words can't say.
She still comes in love her own way.

An' it goes like this.
That girl has got a thunderstorm of love down inside her.
When we kiss,
Nothin' in the world can take me higher:
There's just one way to describe her,
And it goes like this.

We got each other, not much else,
How she keeps me smilin', it's hard to tell.

Sixwire,"I remember a boy in his back yard
And all the games he used to play
Looking for armies to conquer 
And dragons to slay
Fearlessly seeking adventure
Riding a make-believe steed
Swearing to all on his honor
To be all he can be, 'cause…

Chorus:
A brave soul fights the good fight
Defending his castle with all of his might
It's an age-old story of life, there are those
Depending on one brave soul

The day finally came when the soldier
Set out to take on the world
Armed with the heart of a warrior 
With his flag unfurled
But real life was not like the back yard
Now enemies are hard to define
The difference between good and evil
Is a very fine line, but…

(Chorus)

Now I'm behind the wheel of my Chrysler
At the end of my daily war
I pull in the drive and I wonder
What's it all for
Then I see a boy in the back yard
I smile at the games that he plays
He's counting on me to defend him
When there are dragons to slay

And a brave soul does all he can
And that makes a hero from an everyday man
He holds it all in his hands
Now I finally know that I am

And all the games he used to play",Brave Soul,2002

Double crossed by one heart

In pieces on the ground
But I'm willing to try
So I'm keeping my
Heart open
Hoping love will come around
And find me again
Won't you save me

But I know in my soul how that goes
You could leave

It was September the third
When I said it all with just three little words

I still gave it all that it's worth

I can't help how I feel

With every kiss that I steal

Is it worth waiting for

I know nothing's changed, but I still had to ask
'Cause I just can't leave you
I'm just not that strong anymore

To tell me that I was slowly losing you
I never heard you mention
I should've paid more attention

But when you said that you were leaving me flat
And you were never coming back

I'll hang on to our love, tooth and nail
Keep my eye on every detail
I love you, and you're gonna know it

Sixwire,"Jack is your neighbor—you see him every day
(He) picks up his paper and he throws you a wave
An ordinary man—seems like a heck of a guy
An average day in his average life
He hugs his kids and he kisses his wife
Then drives his minivan to his nine-to-five
No one knew a thing 'til they caught him on tape
Breaking into cars at the YMCA

Chorus:
Did you hear about Jack?
Everybody's talking
It wasn't such a straight and narrow line he was walking
No one can believe he would ever do a thing like that
But then you don't know Jack

There's more to this story that we haven't heard yet
But it seems our friend Jack had some gambling debt
That got out of hand—and he couldn't pay
And his eighty grand a year doesn't cover his bills
When he spends it all on prostitutes and pills
But a desperate man is gonna find a way
A wallet lying on the front seat of a car
Couldn't solve all his problems
But it's a good start

(Chorus)

Late last night, Jack went for a drive
He had a revelation down on I-65
He'd be worth more dead
Than he was alive

Did you hear about Jack?
It's all over town
They're not really sure about the way it went down
No one can believe he would ever do a thing like that
But then you don't know Jack
No you don't know Jack",Jack,2002

Reason to live and the strength to stand

I'll give you my blood if that's all you need
Just don't tell me that I'm gonna die,

Sixx: A.M.,"She speaks to me in Persian
Tells me that she loves me
The girl with golden eyes

I let her in my veins

'Take me in your arms
The way you did last night.'

I'm out of dope so I threw away all my rigs.
Day two. I can't believe it's been two days without junk.
F***ing smack, it just ruins peoples' lives.
At first it seems so sweet, then you wake up next to a monster.
Day three. I haven't had anything for three days now.
This withdrawal is killing me. It's like shock therapy to my guts.
Day four. Last visit to the clinic. My whole body feels like it's cracking into pieces.
Fragile doesn't even come close to describing how I feel.
Day five, I'm sick as a dog, but this handful of painkillers
and a lotta whiskey's gonna get me through.
Day six, when I'm left to my own devices I go fucking insane.
I'll never use heroin again.
Day seven, I can't believe I'm clean!
Day eight, everyone says I look better
Day nine, the parasites are panicking
Day ten, they seem amazed that I'm alive!

The rocks on the tracks leaving devil snairs laying.

Have you heard of Ethiopia the purest land thereof, thereof ?

Give Selassie I the praise 
Or else you're punish as the beast

Chorus: 
Babylon your mental chains break 
For Ethiopians progress ourself, we educate 
Well a lightning, not a earthquake 
Babylon your mental chains break 
Black people go home, for righteousness sake 

Verse 2: 
The preaching is over, what's your actions to this? 
So land up inna them land, nothing you have accomplished 
Them inna them computer age, children beware of it 
Because everything, everything becomes cybernetic

Too much inna Babylon, that is too much for your kit 
Computer is them world, them number is six six six 
That's the mark of the beast, look out for micro-chip

I just can't do without her, OH JAH!

When people say they don't love, they never see progress
Wouldn't right to let them be alone
Whenever they say things, never you be upset
Just be kindhearted, Rastafari welcomes all at home
Now the people have been misleaded
All because of foolish reasons
How strongly do you hold your own?

'Cause I myself know, that no man is an island, no man stand alone
'Cause I myself know, without the Conquering Lion I would never endure

When I heard them say play the music no more
I know they've been wounded by truths and rights so pure
And if they should say do away with the true source, 
       you know that they're unfair
Hey, they don't know how this come about now
All His great wisdom buildeth a true house, withstand everlasting
Africa we shout like never before

'Cause I myself know, that no man is an island, no man stand alone
I myself know, without the Conquering Lion, I would never endure

After all you know the world has been taught
To be the system, that down press your very soul
You never know when they will lurks in the dark, 
Willing to do the killing, for a dollar they knock you down cold
Corrupt in their heart, no trust whatsoever
Who is so clever, to be under their take hold

'Cause I myself know, that no man is an island, no man stand alone
I myself know, without the Conquering Lion, I would never endure

When the people say there ain't no love, they never see no progress

Oh! Girl won't you accept my potion 
Things going to be just fine, just hold on

Show me that your love is real, cause that's the kind I ever want to feel 
Show me that your love is pure, and I'll be there for you and I'm sure 
Show me that your love is real, cause that's the kind I ever want to feel 
Show me that your love is pure, and I'll be there for you and I'm sure

His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car

Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide

He does shit to make it better

Two attempts on my life, they threatened venues
Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue
I bought more jewels, I ordered the Wraith
I got a new style of shoes, match the watch in the face
Bill Belichick, coaching and calling the shots
Throw a yellow flag, pussy nigga body drops
Then we celebrate, black bottles pop
Time to elevate, we re-open shop
Wale a genius, Meek Mill a superstar
My new crib in Phoenix, ten car garage
Petite felite, platinum Audemars
Ain't no tags needed, nigga, I own them cars
I know them bitches, we met them broads
Never loved one, fucked them all
I'm a fucking dog, Ricky fucking Ross
Nigga Birkin bags just for my runner-ups
But my main bitch she get the main dish
Not the old range, that was a lame bitch
Brazilian weave, she say I came quick
I let her see a hundred ki's, a different St. Nick
Moving bricks like it's Black Friday
She gotta fuck me or call me a fat crybaby
Looking over my shoulder, I can't trust a soul
Bought a spot in Anguilla just for me and my ho
Glock .40, even when I shower
Chrome .22 in my swimming towel
Mob ties and I pray the music set me free
May the powers that be, nigga let me be

We around when the sun goes down
And the real, real killers they mourn for ya
It's gonna be a bloodshed
One month, one day it's gonna be a bloodshed
Bop, gunshot in the head
Payback is a motherfucker
Yes, I feel it when I squeeze the trigger
I feel the air when my enemies die
I feel the strength of ten killas
What is to be, will be
Only God on earth can kill me
'Cause these fucking streets filthy
And I ain't fucking guilty

Gangsta no take no chance, from no guy
Know why? Violate a gangsta and bullets fly
Boy die
Guns go off ah suh me say
Murderings in anyway
Gangsta no take no chance, from no guy
Know why? Violate a gangsta and bullets fly
Boy die

And the real real killas, them hunt for you
Ay, it's gonna be a bloodshed

SJ Spooky,"Make his fight on the hills in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless gray
On they fight for their right, yes, but who's to say?

For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
? wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain and they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry

Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see

Servir de carne de cañón, peleas en clandestinidad

Sin descansar, sigue buscando sin rumbo su viejo hogar
Un alarido en la noche me estremeció
Bajo las ruedas de aquel maldito camión
Y no es el final, mañana comienza ésta historia en otro lugar

Y de su muerte un negocio creo
El vaticano es un imperio que devora con ingenio

En compañía vamos a olvidar la agonía de los pueblos

I sold my soul at an early age 

And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage 

My eyes in a daze 

Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming 

Is juices running when ya done in 

Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid 

But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they 

dead 

Crack scarfs for my fucking glory 

Talking shit up in my territory 

Another day another world's sad story 



Verse 2 (Steph) 



Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block 

Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock 

Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard 

Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol 

Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags 

Tagging toes, nigga drive slow 

Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese 

Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues 

Freeze your whole coalition 

Strapped with ammunition 

Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads 

This figure from head to toe 

Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door 

But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales 

Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail 

Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale 

Lyrical laggers, want to be chrome packers

My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat 

You hoes ain't fucking with that 

Or this, cause I piss on competition 

And have all you hoes in submission 

Trying to recondition your stilo

One other sequel from the infamous unseen 

Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine 



Verse 3 (Mia X) 



Cause she up to schemes 

Tired of chasing apple pie dreams 

Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know 

50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers 

Followe by your second line of flowers 

I devour competition, causing complete submissions 

Cooks more dope in my kitchen 

Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls 

Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed 

Boss chick you don't want to see her 

Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters 

Mia's right and left well known with the clout 

To wire your mouth, knock your grill out 

That's what this here be bout 

So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip 

Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit 

Too much to deal with

And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands

Chuva sobre chuva, noite e dia só chuva
E eu descia para rua
No meio da avenida um amigo me via
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali, depois de conto
Chuva tão sem graça, tudo que aborrece passa
Logo o sol ensolarava
Passando pela praça uma gata me mata
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali depois te beijo
Um pregador me pega
Me prega o seu asco, um saco
E eu já tava no inferno
Um pregador moderno.
Blusão de couro em vez de terno
Aonde vai, filho?
Vou ali, depois me humilho
Cineclube à tarde, filme de Godard e Bergaman
Nunca mais vou esquecer
Te conheci na vida, te conheci num fim de ano
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali, depois te amo
Baixo é guitarra, noite e dia só farra
Que saudade de uma missa
No adro da igreja meu amor se divertia
Aonde vai, Sam?
Vou ali e volto um dia
Aonde você vai, Sam?
Os dias são muitos
Aonde você vai, well?
Podemos ir juntos

Simpatia gera simpatia
Alegria gera alegria

Charles que deu a voz
Ao outro lado da cidade
Um grande rapper de São Paulo
Deu ao filho o nome Jorge
Invocando de novo o guerreiro
Que batuca no violão
O futuro de muitos velhos macumbeiros
De todos os butecos que Santa Clara clareia
Pelo mundo afora porque outros meninos
Virão
Com outras formas de samba
Pra melhorar nossa história
Levanta e ""vamo simbora""
Que a área tá pesada
Nosso charles agora é o rei mais novo
Que lá em cima do morro
Limpando a 45

Tudo normal nas cabeças, parece

Skank,"Fim de semana, fim de tarde
Eu mexo o gelo do copo com o dedo
Melhor sozinho, até porque
A solidão é uma velha amiga

As persianas clichezadas
Não filtram a poeira dourada
Esse escritório às vezes dá impressão
De um pardieiro suspeito

Longa avenida eu sei, mas eu preciso encontrar
Outra saída eu sei, pra esse romance noir

A sombra entra lentamente
Enquanto o trânsito ecoa distante
Não sei porque ela insiste
Mas não vou, não vou pensar nisso agora

Como também não vou pensar
Que o amor tem seus próprios fios
A chuva desce com trovões
E da janela observo a fiação

Skankin' Pickle,"When I was 15 years old, I weighed only 96 lbs
Then my PE teacher told me about anabolic steroids

My body started to swell, my penis didn't look too well
After deep thought meditation, I joined the Wrestling Federation

When I step into the ring, little hulksters scream and shout
Although I'm feeling really, I can't keep my hair from falling out

Macho grabs me by the hair, throws me up into the air
There goes another 60 strands out into the screaming fans

I'm Hulk Hogan
I am losing all my hair

Skankin' Pickle,"We live in a racist world, you gotta stop hating each other
I wonder what the world thinks of one another
I know theres something wrong with me

But there's a problem in our society
You see the blacks hate the whites
And the whites hate the blacks

Or is it something else or opposite
Or maybe I am to blame for this
Wars are going on this time

To satisfy the minds of an ageless crime
And then the youth of today becomes a part of tomorrow
And tomorrow's just as worse

And it even starts to follow suit of shooting in the streets
Another rock star dies again
Boy has aids and makes news in the Enquirer
Hey there, won't you be my brother?

Too many things on my mind
I wish I could change the ways
That I have spent my time

Too lazy to get up
And help my father with the chores

But who am I to score

But starting from 0-0
Give me the ball I say
Pride I have and always will
And I'm not a Pabu boy

Take time to think things over
Hey, that sounds okay
Even though it's four years later
And the kid has grown to stay

Make no mistakes
I understand there comes a time
To move along in some way
And make ends meet with mom

Until that day, need I say
""Don't worry ‘bout me""
I will be fine you see
And I am not a Pabu boy

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Skarr Akbar,"It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen
Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves
Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene
Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve
Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts
More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count
On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out
Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town
Town business like you found business when you brought it down
Borderline 'til a seven hundred forty-five brought around
And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away
You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away
Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away
Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

'Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists when it's clicking, you see that
Point out what you want and it's yours
'Cause you gon' ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that
Point out what you want and it's yours

It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout
Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs
The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist
And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out
Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front
Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want
But retro's is a weekly occurrence
And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished
In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone
Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home
'Til they teach you bout a throne and the leather that the seat on
Is from the same couch you got your feet on
Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on
Grew up idolizing like if Jay on, then we on
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in
Pressure bends knees like the side effects of Klonopin's
You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans
The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try agains
Silence, talk less and do more
No time to ask who is it
When knockers knock at your door
Put yourself in a position to listen
Or be a victim
Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore
When summer falls, we spring into the winter
Recruit 'em at front and center
Move product with new beginners
So the package that we lend ya
Out of respect for ya father
Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow
Just do it how they taught ya
And everything will work if you believe that
Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that?

Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)

Stumblin over boulders lookin over my shoulders 
Hopin you're behind me but the sun blinds my vision 
No competiton cause I'm wishin and hopin 
that we could go to Canada, and Ann Lee lopin but nopin
I know you caught playin with your heart
Shoulda known that I was up to no good from the start
Little hoodrat who's that guy I saw you walkin with 
Talkin with actin like he's wit ya 
Just like 2 Pac you know ""I get around"" 
But I didn't mean to get around with your little sister 
Think I was lookin for your friend so let me try again 
To prove myself cause I don't want nobody else
It's been 7 hours and 16 days since you took your love away
So I just want to say that you should

I never meant you any wrong my dear
Besides yo you can't believe everything you hear
So just like Stevie ""I Wonder"" is there water all under the bridge
It's thrillin but lately I've had this strangest feelin like Jodeci
I'm goin through the emotions so baby won't you just stay OK!
I'm tryin to get you offa my mind but you just won't go away
In fact just the other day I was coolin at a party on a Friday
Doin things my way chillin with my cousin Shareef
A girl walks my way couldn't say get away 
Cause then again it goes against my Islamic believes    
So I'm a big game to get to know the honeys name
Cause you know that I was lookin for a real good time 
She was fine so I kicked a few lines

Can't keep breakin my heart so don't pursue that

Pain is the essence but not my intent 
So gaze through the woods and stop through the meadows

But what's this was honey just fakin it that kept me from my ducats 
Now the rain has gone I can clearly see
What was we enemies?
Not for long alone is what she wants to be
But what am I to do, what am I do to?
What would you do if you were in the same shoes?
With a bunch of bad news from my hoodrat
Sorry but I gotta scatter I'm movin from the East to the West
So please say God Bless and oh yes see I miss her very much
I wish that I could give her my number so that she could stay in touch
I wonder if she remembers me and what went on 
And if she does not understand word is born I'ma keep holdin on

Or chill and have a seat or choke of the smoke of a cactus tree
As I'm steady pumpin sounds out my NBC
With the natural ability to make you want to get down
And maybe slap five to everyone around

Till the break of dawn at a club I'll be
So you know to put your dirty hands up in the air 
And wave em side to side like you just don't care, yeah

And the brothers in the corner with the jerboas

The sounds can be heard from Cali to New York
Forget about your troubles forget about your blues 
Cause jazz is alive so go and spread the news 
And once the news is heard then others can relate 
Maybe find the phattest samples from the back of the crates
So chill cool with the breeze microphone check one, two to the three
Break down doors dance on floors and have your fun

You played the punk and ran a sprint 
See one of us is trippin but I was just concerned 
At the time I lost my wallet 
and you found it stole my money then returned it 
You used to claim in front of people we were next of kin

Your heart is darker than the night so I'm prepared to use my high beams

Sharin with you my feelings and in the meantime you was killin 
Me softly hey women get off me you know you lost me
Hey that's what you get for actin flossy

Just change your life and your identity

When I come around the block 
It's all the same the only thing that's changed is
You used to call me puff but now you call me by name

Last year when I went home, got in my car and got gone
Hit the streets and shot on, 18 years since I'm gone
Call my homie Jerome, spoke to his brother Tyrome
Who seemed a little distant cause my calls were not persistent
He say Rome went to prison for resistin' arrest
And mamma had a problem wit her chest, what, cardiac arrest
I was hurt and ain't even been here a week
And after all that bad news I couldn't speak
And my toes went weak and my legs went numb
It gets crazy in the streets tryin' to live wit no funds
Don't cheat you don't eat, your case you can't beat
Public defenders is there to make the deals go sweet
For the prosecution it's like an execution
But you can make it if you're patient and avoid confusion
It took a while for me to learn this and stay on my feet
But if this rappin' don't happen for me I'm goin' back to the streets

Back when I had a shag chewin' gum wearin' chucks
Before I even thought about makin' the big bucks
I was busy throwin' rocks at cars and dump trucks
Even now I can hear her mamma callin' my full name
Me and uncle Joe would be watchin' the Bulls game
Before they had Jordan when all you needed was change
To get yourself some candy, some pickles and sugar canes
Even then I could feel the streets movin' all through
My veins and everything I seen absorbed in my brain
I'm not afraid to tell it my brother I'm not ashamed
You take a look at me now and look at where I came

Where most of the hoodsters and thugs be
If it hadn't of been for all the people that loved me

But people don't, got it misunderstood, street code is
Simply you stick to your own hood
Stay in your own woods and chop your own tree
And if something jumps off pretend you didn't see
Keep your mouth shut up, for you get knocked up
Ain't no since in tryin' to get somebody else locked up
And that's the truth
That's why I send messages to the youth
Hope the lord makes a way out
Forget the gang and stay out
Cause everybody wants to live in the sunshine
If not right now at least at one time
Look back in your mind remember you was a kid
Remember before you grew up how innocent you lived
From big wheels to big thrills and big heights
From innocent to killin' your brother for Air Nikes
And I can't believe that none of these things don't
Strike y'all brothers in the head like this ain't right

And any time a tiny face will show itself cause waiting's almost over

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

But I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him

You stole his love from me one day
You didn't care how you hurt me
But you can never steal away
Memories of what used to be

You think he's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when his love grows cold
That I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him

You think he's yours to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn when his love grows cold
But I've forgotten more
Than you'll ever know about him

Skeeter Davis,"If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail around this whole wide world
To the boy I love the best

If I had listened to what my mama said
I would not have been here today
Oh, wishin' for things that I'll never have
And weepin' my young love away

He taught me to weep, he taught me to moan
He taught me to leave my home
That lonesome town and those good old times
I'm on my way back home

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail around this whole wide world
To the boy I love the best

Now when you see that other blond
There's something you can tell her
She need not fool her time away
Tryin' to steal my feller

Now when you come upon me
Put on your navy blue
That long tail [Incomprehensible]
Don't blew a thing for you

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail around this whole wide world
To the boy I love the best

Now only use four-letter words

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows,

And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today

When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got

I did it alone, only God as my witness
My nigga got off cause we tied up the witness
and made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court
You know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin'
them niggas gon' be at your throat
Everyday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin'
with two tweny-three at your door
Flippin' a check off this rappin'
go back to the trap and put that in the weed and the blow like

Running niggas down back and forth

I just caught a body like a week ago
These hatin' niggas want attention, I don't see 'em though
You talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro
We pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European [?]
S to the K to the E-M-E, callin' the EMT after I empted this clip
I sold my dope right on CMT, I'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets
Chuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters, so I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits
Rolley on wrist, no toc or no tic, your girl on my dick, man come get your bitch
Niggas think this a rap now, I might back down and come try your luck
Riders with me be wired up, they ridin' with me till the tyres bust
Haters talkin', but they better cool it, before that nigga Crooked get fired up
Lay you out like my Balmains, you gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up
Drinkin' lean till I'm high enough, I don't give a fuck about [?] nigga
I ain't squashin' shit, I won't call it off, I just handle mine like a man nigga
I'm on frontline with these bands nigga
Need a chair, I can't stand niggas

Skepsis,"Ich kam sauber auf die Welt, blass wie milchweißes Fell
Elternhaus leicht kaputt, doch damals fehlte noch kein Geld
Zu 'nem Sportler erzogen, lehn' Kontakt mit vielen Drogen ab
Hängen mit Ganoven, der Teufel findet dich, dann kommt das Schicksal
Wie 'n Kescher, nimmt dich in den Schwitzkasten
Und die Hyänen, die darauf lauern, dass sie Schnitt machen
Im Schatten findet niemand seinen Weg
Denn es ist Kopf über Wasser oder leise untergehen
Dann war die Welt mein Problem, jeder Tritt von ihr tat weh
Und irgendwann wird jeder Hund mal aggressiv, wenn man ihn schlägt
Der Kopf geht kaputt, wenn man weiß, man kommt nicht klar
Und eigentlich hat man viel mehr Potenzial
Der Frust staut sich an und fuckt dich jeden Tag ab
Und irgendwann erbrach ich dann immer mein Inneres auf's Blatt
Das Gefühl war kurz weg, nur in Ketten zu liegen
Und immer, wenn der Beat läuft, hab' ich Frieden

Zu viele Stimmen, die uns leiten, zu viele Ketten, die uns halten
Wenn die Gedanken sich nur noch im Kreis drehen, wer soll uns beisteh'n?
Denn da, wo die Mauern zu hoch sind, bleiben Träume auf dem Boden
Doch ganz unten ist lang nichts verloren
Denn jeder Weg hier raus führt nach oben und

Jedes Mal, wenn ich rappe brechen Mauern um mich auf
Diese Welt bekommt einen Farbton mehr als nur grau
Auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus
Und alle Hunde durchbeißen ihre Ketten
Jedes Mal, wenn wir rappen, hört der Druck auf der Brust kurz auf
Bevor der Frust sich staut

1-9-8-8, er erblickt das Licht der Welt
Seine Mutter noch ein Kind im Kopf, doch das Herz macht halt, was es will
Keine Perspektive, außer wahre Liebe und ein Vater, der nie da war
Was soll aus ihm werden? Ein Versager, auch wenn Mutter nur das Beste für ihn wollte
War sie leichte Beute, weil der Kleine war der Teufel
Was Schule, 24/7 high, nix gelernt, aber immer noch dieses eine Lied im Kopf
Ja, er war blass wie milchweißes Fell
So naiv, glaubte alles, was der Wu-Tang-Clan erzählt
Kulturschock in CAB, kannte die Straße vorher nur von 'ner DVD, nicht mal ein Film
Doch Mucke bleibt Mucke wie wenn man das selbe Blut hat
Egal, ob man es schwer oder leicht hat
Nur Abfuck im Alltag, wenn man wieder keine Zeit oder alles wieder leid hat
Gelacht oder geweint hat

Jedes Mal, wenn ich rappe brechen Mauern um mich auf
Diese Welt bekommt einen Farbton mehr als nur grau
Auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus

Immer, wenn ich im Studio bin, bin ich nicht draußen
Wo die Queens Shit kaufen, Jungs ihren Schnitt brauchen
Du bist nur ein Schnittlauch, fang' an zu pumpen
Ich lass' mich nicht lumpen, denn ich kam ganz von unten
Ich kam aus dem Dunkeln, Parties und Alk
Mit Kopfschmerzen hart wie Asphalt, doch ich stapel es bald
Deshalb bin ich am rappen, für fettes Bling, fette Ketten
Edelsteine, Ringe, ich mach' Action
Ich dreh' auf für die Jungs, mach' die Scheiße für sie
Denn schon seit 2001 kick' ich Reime auf Beats
Jedes Jahr, was vergeht, ohne Para verdient zu haben
Steigert nur die Hitze meiner Artillerie
Fette Knarren, jede Zeile trifft
Doch man vergisst: Für die Kids hier ist jede Zeile Gift
Doch man vergisst: Ohne Mucke wären wir oft schon ausgetickt
Lass mir nur den einen Augenblick wenn ich rappe

Jedes Mal, wenn ich rappe brechen Mauern um mich auf
Diese Welt bekommt einen Farbton mehr als nur grau
Auf einmal führen Wege aus dem Käfig heraus

I kill them and I put them in a cemetery
And if anybody thinks they're sick in the head

Bare skeng talk I can't believe them
Red and white R6 I'll leave them
Ed Hardy glasses I can't see them
So why you talking like you can't die
One bullet in each lung breath then
See your sounding weezy
And I heard your CD
You and your mandem are talking greezy
I just tell a man like D-E-E
Come On Come On
Do you really think if I give 2 shits if you're greezy?
I don't think so
You man ain't seen greezy yet
All my mandem pop it off
Your man will fly off into the sky like easyJet

I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you
Cross my heart until the day I die

I've been around the world and back
Screaming more money more paper
Been doing it major
Even Walkers ain't go this much flavor
They say I'm superbad like Mclovin
Now man are calling me family all of a sudden
And I'm like mum how come you never told me that I had all these cousins
This corner I'm standing in never felt claustrophobic when I came here 10 minutes ago
Now my backs against the wall
It's a good job I'm tall
So I can always see clear
Even with all the smoke in the air
I know some are standing here cause of loving fame

They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
And all my real friends know I'ma still keep it 10 multiplied by 10
Forgive me if I've been acting a little strange
I never ever knew that one song could make my whole life change
Last week I boarded six planes
But I can't complain this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let em all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please, listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart I'll be the same guy that I was at the start
I hope to die I cross my heart

Skepta,"Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this Amnesia

Skepta, Charts
Last night was sick
Oh what a city I lost my phone though oh what a pity
When I woke up I found a note that said
Sorry I had to go ily
I looked around this can't be real
'Cause I don't recognize this
Then I saw the minibar and I was like rar
Somebody terrorized it

Not even a bottle of water
Make it worse this room was hotter than a sauna
So I jumped up got ready.
Went downstairs to the hotel lobby
Man are like swear down you're a mad man skeppy
I must have had one to many
'Cause I can't remember anything
After the two Jägermeisters and a bottle of Henny

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this Amnesia

Who you trying to diss?
Who did you fight with?
Who did you kiss?
Who did you dance with?
Who did you lits?
Aw man, you were a myth

I remember walking in blinded by the lights
Look left, look right
Saw two men that I don't like
But I already lit up the room when I walked in
No need for fireworks tonight
Unless it's on the side of a bottle
And I'm only here for one night on the high
So I'm trying to find me a model
We circled the party once
Nothing, twice
Dead third time around I saw a girl I tuck into bed
Two minutes later, I'm at the bar
Doing shots of Jäger
That's when I blacked out
Anything after that's all a myth
Like Lorrie Ager, major

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia

Who you trying to diss?
Who did you fight with?
Who did you kiss?
Who did you dance with?
Who did you lits?
Aw man, you were a myth!

We had one drink, two drink, three drink four
Had one too many, now you're laying on the floor
One drink, two drink, three drink, four
Had one too many, now you're laying on the floor

You lost your phone
You lost your friends
Now here comes that classic line
I'm never drinking again
Thought you were casually drinking
But you were actually binging
Woke up somewhere you've never been to in your whole life and now your thinking

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means
Feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this Amnesia

Somebody remind me what happened last night
'Cause I can't remember a thing

Skepta,"They say ""Skepta, you must get loads of girls""
The music's picked up now
Tell em like J2k, nah, it's all switched up now
She thinks that if she talks to me they'll call
Her a groupie behind her back now
So she stands far but close enough for her pictures
To have me in the background
I'm kinda used to it now
They say it's all part and parcel
And if it's this much for me
Imagine what's it's like for Curtis and Marshall
I wanna go hard
But my body keeps telling me to take it easy
So I sit here watching a DVD logo bounce around the TV
My life ended ages ago, now it's all a dream
Sitting here, thinking how this thing all started
From What D'Ya Mean, What D'Ya Mean
Now that I'm getting that paper I heard a couple man want me dead
So I went out bought a Gucci hat and put money on my own head
I forever hear people talking like I don't know about street
Fake gangstas must think I spent my music money on chocolate and sweets
You're looking for beef in London? Nah it's not hard to find it
But I'm not scared of a gun, it's all about the man behind it

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life make people wanna wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
See when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
Truss

Sometimes I think that I think too much
I start thinking about thinking
Then I start to get paranoid
I think my windows need tinting
They say why work all this time
To get famous Joseph
Just to wear sunglasses
Cause you don't wanna get noticed
Once in a while I take em off
And I'm like ""arrr, that's too bright""
Because I sleep all day then I wake up at night
Then I phone my girl, see if she wants to link
She said she got work in the morning
So what do I do, I go out for a drink
I spend all my time in clubs
It's starting to feel like home
I don't wanna sit in the VIP but sometimes I just wanna be left alone
I hate when I'm in a bad mood and I see all my supporters vibes'n
And I apologies to anyone I've taking a pic with when I weren't smiling
They say ""don't you remember me I met you at Party In The Park""
Babe, I can't even where I parked my car in the car park
Now she hates me and every time she hears my song she's changing the station
I swear the human brain weren't designed to deal with all this information

You still wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
You see when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
Truss

Listen tomorrow isn't promised to us so
You have to enjoy today
Cause the game is like a box of roses
Cause when they're done with the chocolate
The wrapper gets thrown away
I said the wrapper gets thrown away

When you're shooting for your targets
And it's making you a target
You die before you live, I wish you warned me when I started
We're going full hearted, R.I.P the half wits
Cause now we're 6 feet under the top spot fuck a casket
Bastards, don't we make the lifestyle look appealing
Independent names and chains
Skepta are we dreaming?
Nobody could season, this track couldn't reach him
Cause now I'm on the other side of that glass ceiling
The underdogs are off the leash
Eh Joseph, pass the muzzles and the leads
The games full of demons, let's get this arm house on
Everyone wants handouts but I ain't stretch Armstrong
We've come so far as emcee's
Round of applause or bust it off just make it clap please
I'm so past just trying to be the favourite
You're nobody until you got some haters
But you still wanna make it BIG!

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You better move into a different lane

Took off the condom, made it rain

Skepta I got the UK buzzing like a vibrator
Now my paper's looking higher than a sky scraper
Chipmunk told me don't watch no face
I'll never leave home without my pencil case

People here are starting to hear you as the King of grime 
because you're the one person that has stuck by this genre of music,

Blowin up shh like a bomb in iraq
Diddys in white I'm in all black
It's about to get real grimey
So somebody say dj pull up the track
Ow shut this down
You ain't heard nothing like this since pow!
You ain't heard nothing like this so god forgive me
Fore I buss my ting right now
Wow I blow my own trumpet
And if you don't like it lump it
I'm a uk badboy and just for the record I like tea
But I don't like crumpets
Dirty money and boy better know together
That's crazy as hell
Me and diddy got both hands on the big red button
Just say the word and we'll shut down the world

This is the grime remix
Hello good morning
Let's go
Hello good morning
Know you been waiting
For it
Hey yo skepta

Walked into the club and I got two sexy girls on each side
Money in the bank but still I got to stay on my grind

Man better mention me when they talk about grime
And they told me to shut this down I'm a do it tonight
I'm a do it tonight
It's skepta I'm that guy
And I'm d-I-d-d-y
Boy better know till I die
And you can't see me I'm way too fly
Chicks stop and stare when I roll by
Hate me and I don't know why
Cause I spent half my life in the sky
And I buy the things that you wanna buy yeah
Take that come on don't stop talk to em girl
So hot that I bring the shit
? I'm a say hello good morning
Spending dirty money everywhere go from the 504 new york to London
? like diddy we get money the ? is acting funny
Cause we jet set we taking all your milk and honey

So to diss you wouldn't be fair
But at the same time if I listen to what you tell me I wouldn't be here
Shit turns to gold when I touch it
So me looking at youtube comments is counter-productive
Cause none of that criticism is constructive
So I switch off the mac like fuck this
You're never gonna see me switchin'
Another twitter account with no pic, 10 followers, 
Following everybody he's dissing
I found myself now I'm missing
They love the grime flow I'm spitting
I took it to the chart now they're listening
I can't wait till I'm on tour I'm itchin'
Make some noise
Somebody tell Will Smith I am Legend
What dya know about looking in the fridge 
And all you can see is a white light like heaven

For some money to buy a birthday present
And now parents want to book me for a sweet 16
I'm a birthday present

They didn't want to rate me
But all my supporters came together and saved me
Tears in my eyes
Head high, pointing to the sky
Screaming nobody made me, nobody made me

Put your hands in the air
For the grime MC of the year
Some say I came out of nowhere
Little d'they know it's been a four year nightmare
Running around with no runner
Had to pay for my own radio plugger
Watch'd everybody eating
While I sat there with no bread, no butter
I told myself I gotta do this
Whatever the weather I get through this
Long as I keep making the hits
My distributors gotta move those units
So I never gave up hoping, naa
Forget crying and sulking
They said I was too grimey
Now me and P. Diddy on the iChat laughing and joking
Make some noise
And I hope all you A and R's heard that
I got so much more that I wanna say
But I'm looking foward I can't turn back
Remember it's boy better know all year from October to September
We built this ourselves so the only man that can ever knock me down is Skepta

I never have a dream when I go to sleep at night
My dream begins when I walk outside
Now I'm on stage and I feel like I'm looking through Michael Jacksons eyes
Stories, rumours and accusations
So I gotta stay self conscious of my hand gestures
Before they call me a Mason or say that I'm working with Satan
But even a blind man could see
I would never sell my soul for the P
When you're looking at Skepta, you're looking at grime
So the only thing I gotta stay true to is me
I don't need a helping hand
Stand up tall, I'm my own man
Find me on the tallest building in the country singing as loud as I can

I-I feel so alive, so alive
(S-K-E-P-T-A)
Got my two feet on the ground
But it feels like I'm in the sky
It's time to enjoy the sun
'Cause we made it through the rain
Put your hands up in the sky
Like you're tryna touch a plane
I-I feel so alive, so alive

(Boy Better Know oh-oh, yeah)

Shit what have I done
Raa, everyone singing along to my bars man
Went triple platinum, see me I'm trying to do what Elvis done
And the stage is way too big for me
Labels never thought this guy from the ghetto could make all these girls sing for me
Nana, nana, nana, na ee
I got a big NANA chain hanging down to my navel
Tell the bartender ""take a fat bottle of champagne to Polydor's table""
Big men acting like school kids
Say there gonna run up on me with a full clip
So I pull down the two flaps on my hat
'Cause I didn't want to hear that bullshit

I-I feel so alive, so alive
(D-A-Double P-to-the-Z)
Got my two feet on the ground
But it feels like I'm in the sky
It's time to enjoy the sun
'Cause we made it through the rain

Like you're tryna touch a plane
I-I feel so alive, so alive (nana, nana, nana, na ee)

It's time to get dark, blacker than Cilla
Fazer aka 6 figure nigga
Man said I got robbed for my chain
Until I put a picture on Skepta's twitter
When I go to the Gucci store I dress rags
Security think that I ain't gonna buy shit
Then I pull out my card, swipe it, bowl out with 20 bags
If I like them, cop them
Fuck the hater, can't stop them
Mc's wanna diss N-Dubz, but they can't get a top twenty let alone a top ten
So if it weren't for the fans
I woulda had a haters blood on my hands
I'm a mastermind behind the keyboard
So I'm a carry on stacking up these grands

I-I feel so alive, so alive

Got my two feet on the ground
But it feels like I'm in the sky

Dunno who you're pretending to be
I don't care what gun you bang
I don't care what drug you sell

7 MC's and five producers on my label

Better bring something to the table

Too many man come in the game for two minutes
Shoot two videos, spit two lyrics

In the same sentence as mine by the critics
What has this world come to
Man better control Z and undo
But all thanks to the love and support

Then I'mma get arrested for TDA

And I don't give a shit who's got a deal
'Cause if the game was a tray full of ice cubes
I'm the coldest and the hardest still

They thought the ""All Over The House"" video would crush me
Last week I did five shows in five different countries
The supports have still got love for me
Middle finger to the media
Hypocrites can't touch me
I'll be in Dubai eating in Nobu
Word to Dumi and T this food tastes lovely
I walk from White Hart lane to the flats opposite Tottenham police station
Payed subs to go on the radio station
Left radio jumped on the train to Leytonstone
Linked Murkle Man to make some more grime in the basement
Lemme show you bout dedication
Suffering from Underdog Psychosis tryna stay alive
Riding around on a bike
Blade long enough to go to jail for, more dots on me than a dice
The olders had the chips and the Big Macs
But didn't wanna let me have a bite
So it was just me, my cats and the foxes roaming the streets at night
Felt like I was wasting life
Put down the cling film and picked up the mic
For one whole year never got music money or money off white
But I know that Rome weren't built in a day
Looked at he end of the tunnel and saw light
Now me and Jme, top 30, back to back on the iTunes site, mental

Niggas ain't got GCSEs still don't wanna work for a minimum wage
These days man will murder a man for a box of grade

This is what music sounds like in my dreams man
Mental

Yeah, I’m in my zone
Livin' a life of the young and the gifted
In the studio, run out of drink, all we got is some weed and biscuits
I'm supposed to be writing
Instead I'm daydreaming about doggy-styling Kate Winslet
Snap out of the dream
Pass me the lighter let me light up the green
A million words in my head
Tryna think about punchlines that I haven't already said
I wanna write a diss track but my enemies are already dead
I only smoke one spliff but my eyes are already red
I'll be waiting 'til the cows come home
For man to offer me a biscuit cos I don't normally beg
Open up the pizza box we got earlier but it's full of crust and corn
We've been here so long
I just heard the speakers yawn
I go hard like Jason Bourne
These other MC's remind me of Mr. Bean and Johnny English reborn
But I still beep my horn
Screamin' team UK
'Cause that's where I made my name
That's where I made my change
That's where I fucked up them pussyholes when they tried to pop my chain
Nothing but true facts that I speak on the track
Real niggas know where the real niggas at
I'm a good youth but I will fight back
Out to the mixed-race, white and black
Fake G's all over the place
Before you put it on me you better put something over your face
'Cause I won't snitch I'll tell the officer I don't wanna press no charges
I'm closing the case
Discharge myself from the hospital
Fuck the constable
Go home and deal with the beef like sunday roast on a plate
See I grew up in London
Where the olders talk, but the youngers ain't listening
I was given dirty looks by the priest at my christening
No food in the kitchen
Two brothers, one sister'n
Right now you're listening to the oldest sibling
And I get so much cake I might change my surname to Kipling
All the mandem raise your glasses again
Here's to another year at the top of the game
Ah we just can't stop toasting
Said I'll be a big MC by end of school term and they thought I was joking
Now I got 15 girls in my bed and each and every one of them's roasting

Same shit different day
Same shit different day

I'm done smiling with people I don't like in places I don't wanna be
She told me it's just a little bit of powder so I look better in HD
I saw the video, I had so much make-up I didn't even look like me
So now it's just me, myself and the camera, 1080p
She saw the video fullscreen on YouTube, now she wants to fuck with a G
Told me she'd come into my house in a long coat with nothing underneath
I would love you more if you brought me a packet of Rizla and something to eat
Please, keep it simple don't act like a leech
I don't wanna hear your ""I'm not a groupie, tell me your real name"" speech
My real name is Skepta and I do this for my niggas that breach
I do this for the girl with green eyes sunbathing topless on a beach
I tell an A&R come check me if you wanna talk about making an anthem
You wanna talk label politics, go and check David Cameron
'Cause if success is judged by chart positions and riches
I'll put the mic down and leave my legacy to reign on all these bitches

I love you so much sometimes I can't breathe
But I still find that standing here watching you leave
I know you want excitement and life on the edge

She gave me the Heisman I said I was a pop star
I said, eh you know me eh, a wat da bloodclart

I walk into the club like I work here
I came fashionably late you were the first here
They say Penn & Teller are making my clothes now
Got my jacket it might disappear if I put it down

Got no feeling in my face like Joan Rivers
Devil in my cup praying for forgiveness
But don't try this at home this ain't for beginners
It’s a déjà vu, I've seen it all before
People on the chairs, money on the floor
Bitches on heat, 20 on the door
So I don't know what are these niggers are watching me for
Aw, must be the chain it's a mad one
Everybody runs Stewie got a gun said she is ready to go
She wants me to come but I've already beat, give the drummer some
Pull out the stick ram pa pa pam
Now she's blowing on the pipe like it's bubble gum
I got a badder bitch that I've got my eyes on

Skepta,"I noticed when I walked in
The room went dark
Somebody better call the police
There's a guy here with no heart
He said he goes by the name of Skepta
He's on a warpath
And he said if anybody touches the crown
He's gonna tear them apart
And a grime MC was telling me
I kill them and I put them in a cemetery
And if anybody thinks they're sick in the head
Then I'm going to rip him to shreds live on the stage like Jeremy
I'm going in for the kill
I wouldn't stop even if I had a punctured wheel
Got no time for the war with will
Squash that beef like a Forman grill
I got a lot of mandem looking out for me
The ladies, they go wild for me
Back to the front, left to the right
And everybody up in the balcony
You can tell by my accent that I'm straight out of London city
Like Wiley
Like Dizzee
Like Tinie
Like Trippy
Let's get busy, I was in forth now I'm in fifth
Man wished I was in port looking at a sixth
Instead I'm on tour
I fxck off the stage, encore
Excuse my French, bonjour
Je m'appelle Skepta AKA Daniel Son
If I'm on the bill at two
Then the party starts at about half past one

I'm a grime MC and I won't change,

I'm a grime MC and I won't change,
Doing it again, doing it my own way
I'm a grime MC and I won't change,
Doing it again, doing it my own way

Because my material is too good to throw away
Doing it again, they tried to stop me but I'm doing it again

I'm, I'm doing it again
They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again
Boy Better Know I'm doing it again.

All because of the grime bars I'm spitting
MC's are talking about quitting
25 mobiles ringing, majors bidding
Boy Better Know chase ringing
I've walked with the best
2 fingers up to the west
Big S tattooed on my chest
Microphone champion no contest
A lot of man never though I would get to say my piece
Can't believe the singles I release
I climbed up the chart at light speed
And I'm made of myrrh I forget about Sajid
If it costs to be the boss
I pay full price
And I can show you my receipt
Scars on my body from wars in the street
Pain in my left arm
And I can't sleep
So I'm sitting up praying for success to come a little sooner
I never suck up to no-one
I'm not a hoover
I come to fxck up the game like a sore looser
The way I turn heads
You would have thought that this was a reverse parking manoeuvre
And when you're listening to Boy Better Know,
You're listening to the sound of the future
I keep my circle tight
And the question everyone's asking is, ""Who are you? ""
So I gotta put these squares in the right place like a Rubiks cube
I'm a solider, what have you been through?
You and your stupid crew
Better remember when you're talking to a chart topper
You're talking to the lord of the mic part 2

Now I’m on another one it’s a night flight
When they say I’m a star I say thank you
It’s all due to the scenes that I ran through
So I keep flyin the flags for all people
No messing about we’re all equal
Vibe alive in the club when I roll in
I get around with the crowd when I’m roaming

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me

They should know I bring vibes on a club night
Keep the crowd hyped up brother party
Red, she wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there’s an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don’t wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she’s gonna hang with me
I’m skanking all round the party I’m skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right
When we’re at the bar we ain’t ramping

Wiley called me on the iPhone
He said get my passport told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase
When I arrive causing a heat wave too
Got my SnapBack and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim
So I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she’s feeling my jewellery
She said that she’s in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It’s not Jesus baby it’s JME
And I was like babe come over
I don’t bite girl come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don’t bite girl come a little closer

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya

You know I don’t usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said its a hype
I can’t find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the richter
And I can’t even tweet a picture
I’m on the dance floor the joke is
I never had a drink but I’m acting the drunkest
She’s staring like I’m a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I’m not supposed to be here though
Haven’t got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I’m partying with the stars
Yep, I can’t complain I just enjoy while it lasts

You are undefeatable

First place never settle for less
What’s the point in trying if you ain’t trying your best
They wanna see me six feet under but I’m watching my steps

Don’t see myself on a skateboard but I stay on my grind
Aiming for the top and I won’t stop till I cross that finish line
I see it like the deaf I listen like the blind
So if I can’t hear them scheming I still see the signs

I never count the days, I make the days count
They wanna take my crown so I swim when they wanna see me drown
Smile when they wanna see me frown, stand up when they wanna see me down
New and improved attitude you don’t wanna see me now

They said I can’t do it but I did it
Now they love me all over the world cause they sat my style is so prolific
If I said it I live it, the black Scott Disick

And if anybody wanna stop me, you're gonna need some kryptonite
I don’t want to sound impolite, but I been sitting here waiting my turn
So if you still don’t know what a boy better know better watch and learn

I let my left foot rest on the side only my right foot's touching the pedal
Losing is not an option so I know I’ve got to come with something special
I’m a winner, JME on my neck, that’s my gold medal
I was underground, now it’s time to take this shit to another level

I never count the days, I make the days count
They wanna take my crown so I swim when they wanna see me drown
Smile when they wanna see me frown, stand up when they wanna see me down
New and improved attitude you don’t wanna see me now

I sit back looking at the game from a birdseye view,
Then I make my move
Never take my foot off the gas, I’m a go hard till I blow that fuse

Now every day's like Saturday
Surrounded by stars
Come chill with the constellation
Then she asked me what my real name was
And killed the conversation
Sometimes I've gotta scratch my head
Like big man ting on a level
Only my mum and dad call me Junior
What makes you so special?
No Rolex timepiece
No Hublot kettle
But still I know when it's time to jump in the car
Put the foot to the pedal like

Yeah, I don't care about VIP
I've got very important places to be
While I'm asleep, I'm making a beat
Girls in the house getting naked for me
What I'm tryna say is basically
Never get a joke man mistaken for me
Corn on the curb if a man diss me
My niggas got the biscuits in T
Santa Claus used to miss my house
So I decorated my own Christmas tree
Ring man's phone if he think's it's beef
What do you mean, ""who is this, blud?"" It's me
My niggas been on crime
Don't get it twisted 'cause I don't beef online
My niggas violent, my niggas loopy
Something you ain't seen on Vine

I don't want a like, I don't want a follow
Diss me today, link me tomorrow
I've got goons that can't leave the country
Above the law, under obbo
I know pain, I know sorrow
I know empty, I know hollow
I just flew my Gs out to Amsterdam
And I told them ""thank me tomorrow""
Cuh man have been in the kitchen
Experimenting with the whipping
And you see, the road ting and the music ain't mixing
Would've thought man was playing baseball
Way man are outside pitching
Never been a punk, never been a victim
Wanna hate on me? Wanna hate on Storm?
Fuck that, let the kings in

I start ringing MCs
Go radio, I start swinging MCs
I was in the trenches, everyday grinding
You couldn't say a man weren't bringing MCs
I will pick up the phone, start ringing MCs
Bars inna my touch, bringing MCs
They know I've got Skeppy on my team
We were on road, living it, skilling MCs
Producers, plus we are living MCs
Bare vibes we have given MCs
I was there back in the day when it was garage
And them man said they wanna get rid of MCs
But them man couldn't get rid of MCs
'Cause since then, we've become bigger MCs
Some MC debts

Took him onstage with Drake and Section
Hate my niggas 'cause every day, it's another great invention
Wanna talk about loot? Then I bring the loot out
Talk about shootout? Better be a shootout like a western
'Cause I don't fear no man
Think you're a killer but your name ain't Cam
Oi, pussyhole, don't look in my span
'Cause you might get shot on the road like 28 gram
And you know who I am
Shower man down like Fireman Sam
Drive to your ends on a two-year ban
With Solo in the transit van
Nah, you can't diss my mum
Shots start fly out and man get bun
Fling on my black garments and dun
Dry skin between my index finger and thumb
I hate man like a nun
That's why I wanna buy a haunted gun
Can't get killed before I get to see my son

Flexing like he had something on the waist
Pull Shorty out the way, blaow, punch him in the face
Made him Shmoney dance, I made him rock away
We ran out of the dance, we could've got away
But we came back, should've gone home and hit the sack

Man, I've been OT since '03

I still can't work out why you would cause a big scene in Nando's
We had a good ting goin' on but that's how that goes
I was drawing away, in your house I didn't want to stay
Don't know when I woke up I felt guilty for the whole day
Too many women on my mind, too many swimmin' in my mind
Now I'm out of control I've been steppin' out of line
Yea she was a fling so it weren't nothin' major, it was just vibes
When I roll with her she's got me in a natural high, no lie
And the time we spent was so great I don't wanna blag
I'm thinkin' different now babe I don't wanna try
I wanna move on cause I want a fresh vibe in the future
I pick up on what's goin' trust, I'm not a snoozer
I know you heard I was spendin' bare time in the boozer
I know the ting we had was cool, but this tings much cooler

All this time, I've known
Yeah, Skepta
Now you have to wait
You have to wait for them so that they can wait for me
MSN and JME, yeah

They're like, ""What's good, G?"" ""Same shit broski, man I'm still hustling""
I switched up the pack, cleaned up the cash but the trap still jumping (true)
Sold white on a pushbike in my brand new jeans so I had the right leg tucked in
Phone line rang so much that the ringtone started to sound disgusting
Young boy in the kitchen with the powder and I weren't making dumpling
Stepped in the night show see all the ladies start re-adjusting
Hat down low with the shades on looking like definitely up to something
Please don't step on my SK's cause I ain't down for scuffing
I look at the game from a bird's eye view that's why I see everyting' properly
Top boy for too many years and still nobody can top me
It's me they all tryna sound like, it's my gang they all tryna copy
But I never complain 'cause I got more where that came from, I got the whole game on me
Yeah, that's what you get when you chosen
Better protect your shit or shit get stolen
You're covered in ice, you gotta pay the price for your wrist to be frozen
Still I'm outside, all on my chains on out in the open
No security, you know the slogan
Who am I scared of? I am the omen

Icy

Lash got the drinks in the booth
Dex is billing them zoots
This ain't a video shoot
Tangerine lemon and strawberry, dun' know I was bringing them fruits
Asked the neighbours about BBK, swear down they're sick of them youts'
We win awards, come home and Attack the Block
John Boyega when I'm acting up
Fuck lower cases I start capping up
Till the big bad ting start backing up
Got a Spanish ting and she's over sexy
That's why the jokers wanna bo' select me
But they cannot draw me out
Got the shades on, the lights don't affect me
No watch in my wrist, still Big Timin'
Feds tryna find the whip I'm in
Pedal to the metal, this shit's flying
Power steering, I'm slip sliding
Can't see me, I stay too lowkey
No, we don't do that dick riding (Greaze)
I'm in my own lane just me
Yeah that's why the plaques in the crib shining
But forget all the numbers, we the top boys
Even your girl knows, it's blatant
And that's how it's gonna be for a while
You niggas better have some patience
No, we ain't on the same platform
No, I'm at a different station

Another atmosphere
Evaporated fear
A place inside that he dreams and knows too well

Letting go
A new reality
The light reflecting in
Revealing lock and key
Inside his prison cell

It's a dream he often fails to tell
School is way too ordinary for him
The reason is for change inward self
But it will never go away

And he dreams
A place of barrenness
Echoing emptiness
The thought deniable but finds it clear and well

Token of clarity
Transact the memory
Holding the docket of the time that he let go
