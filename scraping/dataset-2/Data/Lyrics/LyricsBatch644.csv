Maggie Bell,"Mother:

You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a wink
But you gaze at your own reflection!
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.
How can the mirror affect you?

Can you hear me
Or do I surmise?
That you fear me can you feel my temper
Rise.

Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror.
Do you hear of fear or
Do I smash the mirror? Smash!",Smash The Mirror,1972
Maggie Bell,"After midnight we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
Give ?em an exhibition
Find out what it is all about

After midnight we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight gonna be peaches and cream
We're gonna loose our inhibitions
Start a new superstition
Find out what it?s all about
After midnight we're gonna let it all hang out

Cause talk and suspicion
Give ?em an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang out

Maggie Bell,"Ah the blues
The ball and chain that is 'round every English musician's leg
In fact every musician's leg
Tryin' to kick it off baby?
No no.
You'll just never do it
And these are the blues of time
And the blues of a woman
And a man thinkin' of her
As time goes by

There is nothin' I can do
If you leave me here to cry
There is nothin' I can do
If you leave me here to cry
You know my love will follow you baby
Mmm until the day I die

I've given you all I own;
That is one thing you cannot deny
Oh I've given you all I own;
Baby that is one thing you cannot deny
And my love will follow you baby
Yeah
Till the day this man dies.

I've got failure all around me
No matter how hard I try.
I've got failure
It's all around me
No matter how hard I
Try try
You know my ghost will haunt you baby
Until the day you stop down and die
Well you better get up
Right now right now

Well
You think that you have left me behind
And that with your other man you're safe
And you're away from me baby but uh
One o' these days you're gonna break down and cry
Because there is no escape from this man
Because this man's love is so strong
He's gonna haunt you
You know my love will follow you
Mmm until the day I die

There is just one thing I want to tell you before I go
I'm gonna leave it
I'm gonna leave it
Leave it up to you
So long
baby bye-bye
Hey I'm gonna leave it up to you baby
So long
baby bye-bye

Well you know my love will follow you
Mmm 'til the day I die
Till the day I die 
Till the day I die 
Till the day I die 
Till the day I die 
Till the day I am dead
Till the day that they rest my head
Till the day I die
Till the day I I I I die
Till the day I die

Maggie Bell,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life,1975
Maggie Bell,"Take off your hat, kick off your shoes 
I know you ain't goin' anywhere 
Run 'round the town singin' your blues 
I know you ain't goin' anywhere. 

You've always been a good, good friend of mine, 
But you're always sayin' ""Farewell"" 
And the only time that you're satisfied 
Is when you dream from the wishing well. 

Throw down your gun you might shoot yourself. 
Or is that what you're tryin' to do? 
Put up a fight you believe to be right 
Someday the sun will shine through. 

You've always been a good, good friend of mine, 
But you're always sayin' ""Farewell"" 
And the only time you're satisfied 
Is when you dream, dream from the wishing well.

And I know what you're wishing for 
Love in a peaceful world 
Love in a peaceful world 
Love in a peaceful world 

You've always been a good, good, good friend of mine, 
But you're always sayin' ""Farewell"" 
And the only time that you're satisfied 
Is with your feet in the wishing well.",Wishing Well,2002

Maggie Bell,"Man's got his woman to take his seed
He's got the power - oh
She's got the need
She spends her life through pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for is an even break

He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Maggie Bibb,"It's still a mystery to me
That the hands of God could be so small
How tiny fingers reaching in the night
Were the very hands that measured the sky

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Heaven's love reaching down to save the world
Hallelujah, hallelujah, son of God, servant King
Here with us, You're here with us

It's still a mystery to me
How His infant eyes have seen the dawn of time
How His ears have heard an angel's symphony
But still Mary had to rock her Savior to sleep

How we need to hear from God
You've been promised, we've been waiting
Welcome Holy Child
Welcome Holy Child
Hope that you don't mind our manger
How I wish we would have known
But long awaited Holy stranger
Make yourself at home
Please make yourself at home
Bring your peace into our violence
Bid our hungry souls be filled
World now breaking Heaven's silence
Welcome to our world

Fragile finger sent to heal us
Tender brow prepared for thorn
Tiny heart whose blood will save us
Unto us is born
Unto us is born
So wrap our injured flesh around You
Breathe our air and walk our sod
Rob our sin and make us holy

you hit me with a flower
You do it every hour
oh, baby, you're so vicious

Vicious
you want me to hit you with a stick
But all I've got is a guitar pick
huh, baby, you're so vicious

When I watch you come
baby, I just want to run far away
You're not the kind of person around I
want to stay

When I see you walking down the street
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet
You're not the kind of person that I want to meet

hey, why don't you swallow razor blades

but baby, you're so vicious

When I see you coming
I just have to run
You're not good and you certainly aren't
very much fun

When I see you walking down the street

Maggie Fitzgibbon,"Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

Maggie Fitzgibbon,"Hawks and crows do lots of things,
but the canary only sings.
She is a courtesan on wings-
So I've heard.
Eagles and storks are twice as strong.
All the canary knows is song.
But the canary gets along-
Guilded bird!

[Chorus]
Sing for your supper,
And you'll get breakfast.
Songbirds always eat
If their song is sweet to hear.

Sing for your luncheon,
And you'll get dinner.
Dine with wine of choice,
If romance is in your voice.

I heard from a wise canary
Trilling makes a fellow willing,
So, little swallow, swallow now.
Now is the time to

Sing for your supper,
And you'll get breakfast.
Songbirds are not dumb,
They don't buy a crumb
Of bread,
It's said.
So sing and you'll be fed.",Sing For Your Supper,2002

Must I explain everything?
Hey! You should really be afraid!

Maggie Galloway,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Maggie Galloway,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1997

Rest here in my arms tonight

And You were made for all mankind

Maggie Green,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,

Just try it and I'll start a riot

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Lightning cracked the sky
Something weird is happening
Something I can't deny

A strange kind of magic
Running through my brain
Feel I'm in heaven
Or going insane

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear, I could fly

Can't you hear my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky

Can't you hear my heart beat so
I can't let you go
Want you in my life

The wind was like a hurricane
Storm clouds filled the sky
I heard a crash of thunder
The earth shook in reply

A strange kind of magic
Running through my brain
Feel like I'm in heaven
Or going insane

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear, I could fly

Can't you hear my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky

Can't you hear my heart beat so
I can't let you go
Want you in my life

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear, I could fly

Cannot dim your light
Autumn winds
Cannot hold you now

I hear you whisper
Through the frozen sea
I hear you calling

Gold desert sands
Shift across the sun
Summer snow
Falls on everyone

But still you whisper
Through the frozen sea
I hear you crying - to me

Melting snow a midnight sun
Not how it was when the world was young
Melting snow a midnight sun
Not how it was when the world began

When the warden started getting sweet on me
And he drugged me to his room one night
And poured me some 'skey gave me a light

Love is where it starts
It resides, often hides
Deep within our hearts

Pebbles make a mountain,
Raindrops make a sea,

Happen all around,

Through a different door,

Walking through the world
Changing it in quiet ways,

Lights a spark,

And the walls can tumble
And the mountains can move,
The winds and the tide can turn,

One for every star,
No lightning bolt or clap or thunder
Only joy and quiet wonder,
Endless possibilities
Right before our eyes,
Oh, see the way a miracle multiplies,

Maggie Worsdale,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop

You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose

Will it say a farewell

And I roll wit' these TRU thugs

Givin' niggaz meanmugs
From tha ghetto I get much love
Ain't no motherfuckin' crosses
Wit' all these crime bosses

Nigga, Nigga, make a move
I'll have you sleepin' wit' dead dudes
My tattoos, represent my identity
It reveals that hard-will of a hard-kill nigga that's n me

My enemies on a rampage, tryin' avoid my presence
Fearin' immediate death, like a fateful pheasant
N my kingdom, only strong soldiers live, that's that law 
Of that ghetto, I broke my hand on a fool's jaw

I'm southpaw
Hand to Hand combat, it's very necessary
My first option, is fightin' all my adversaries
That nigga flinched, when my motherfuckin' gun went ""POW""
You heartless motherfucker, don't cry now

[Chorus: x6]

[Fiend talking again]
There, you motherfucking have it
Some of that youngest hard niggas and that motherfucking world

Magic,"All this drama, and all this pain
Sometimes I wonder if we all put here for a game

So much drama, so much pain
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game
All the casualties, got us caught up in the game
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game

Picture this drama, that we stuck in
Lookin' for ways to keep from hustlin'
I wasn't born to be nothin'
And my muthafuckin' life is cursed
And I plan to see these streets for everything it was worth
And my momma lookin' at me like I was dead in a burst
Since the loss of my uncle,
My pain it got worse And it hurts to see my
Momm fallin' down in tears
And to me, my life ain't clear
Got me livin' in fear
Sheddin' tears, for my dead peers
Who's to blame for my muthafuckin' 
Pain that I'm feelin' inside

Well nigga don't cry keep your head up and roll wit' this pressure
Control this pain that you feelin' 'cause it's only to test ya
Drama, I've been in since I left the wooms of my momma
Still trynna cope wit situations left behind me
Will I ever find another way even though I pray
Judgement day ain't far away from what my momma say
But I'm trapped in this thug livin' and thug sinnin' heavenly father
Forgive me for all my drug dealin' pressure and pain
All those that wanna make a change
But all this drama got a nigga trapped in this game

So much drama, so much pain
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game
All the casualties, got us caught up in the game

All the casualties, got us caught up in the game
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game

I'm surrounded by so much drama, every day I visualize
Walk the streets wondering I'mma die or stay alive
I could recall bein' bad on the streets hustlin' for mine
I use to hustle wit' dimes
Now I'm hustlin' wit' rhymes
The FED's is watchin',
The police is crooked everywhere that a nigga go,
The law trynna book me
I grew up in the ghetto I'm sheddin' tears
And livin' in fear
Late at night, trynna sleep, shots rang out my ears
I'm present in this game, I feel the end is close
The other day I could've sworn I see a fuckin' ghost
It's hard to survive in the fuckin' N.O.
You never know when it's yo time to go

They got me livin' in a world that's full of despise
I can't cope wit' the authorities wit' this red in my eyes
So I proceed across the battlefield bustin' for glory
These demons preachin' for my soul, but I be damned if I'm buried
I got shit to live for I got dreams to forfill
If I die today or tomorrow, who gon' pick up the steel
Don't let mind deceive ya, you either kill or get killed
You muthafuckas ain't feelin' me, so it's best you get real
These fuckin' laws got a nigga stressin' but I'm a thug
Ain't no love on these streets for blacks wit' drawin' blood
Crooked cops tryin' to throw all us blacks n the rump
But lord protect us til' we make it home
It's so much drama nigga

So much drama, so much pain
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game
All the casualties, got us caught up in the game
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game

It's my time
I can feel your pain
Nigga now allow me to spit some game
Watch these stanky bitches beware a nigga that's lame
You can die in the hands of a coward, so keep your eyes open
I done seen a lot of hard niggas die wit' their chest smokin'
But have no worry Gambino family 'cause I'm on your side
If any of them break your tradition, then I'll be down to ride
Let no man question my dedication
To whoeva it is, I'll whoop his ass in front the whole nation
No interference from you outsidas I'm a rida
You runnin' and runnin' while all the time I'm right behind ya
Trust me like you trust your momma
Popps ain't raise no punks, I'm know for bringin' drama

I'm from the ninth ward[Been there since the day I was born]
From the ninth ward[Got us coming up like a storm]
From the ninth ward[Niggas better sound the alarm]
Here come the ninth ward,ninth ward hard

[Magic]
Bitch,I was born and raised in the ninth ward
So you niggas don't bother me
You can say what you may about the ninth ward
But I bet you won't follow me
'Cross that canal where my niggas dwell
You know me well
Cause I sold rocks, upon my block
Till I was hotter than hell
Every nigga down here remember me
Nothin' really changed but my gold teeth
I'm still that same nigga from my Flood Street
Only difference now is that I'm on my feet
And I don't sell dope no mo'
Don't rob no mo'
Mane a nigga don't plot no mo'
Cause I'm performing in shows 
Shakin' off hoes
Smokin' on optimos
It'll be a World War 3 fuck with me
Now my niggas won't let that ride
I'm the only nigga out chere screaming 9th Ward
So people tryin' to keep me alive
Everywhere I go they see the nine on my arm
And they swear that I'm in a gang
But nigga this is a warning, I'm 'bout my hands
Like I'm 'bout them motherfucking thangs
I'm trouble starter just like my father 
He was raised in the nine
So if you cut my arm it still tated in my mind
No matter millions or which ever the situation might come
I'll never forget you niggas 
Never forget where the fuck I'm from

Chorus-2x

You know you could take the nigga out the nine
But you can't take the nine out of nigga
Pulling capers is my nature 
I'm addicted to making paper
Got my own way of living 
Bitch I'm from the see-T-see
Where niggas roam around looking for beef
Killing for free 
I take this ward shit to heart 
It's tated on my arm
So me and my niggas never part
I keep you niggas in my mind 
For every clucker that I serve
For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed
To every god damn rock
For every cop that done chased me 
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn
It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone
We learned to improvise on my block
Never had a ball 
We played football wit' a concrete rock
Now picture that
I could never forget my mission
I'm a turn the nine into something bigger that yo' vision
Before I'm done the world'll scream

Mi puta, this what it's all about huh, fucking and sucking
You piece of trash, every gimp like you needs a pimp like me ok
You get on that fucking block and you make my money you piece of trash
Make my money right now, you get on that street and you look good
And you work good and you suck good ok

(kane)
Dressed to impress like I'm slinging them birds
Put a bitch on pimp arrest as she keep her eyes to the curb
These ho's we don't need em, we let the welfare feed em
Hustlas pimp hoes for pussy let them fake bustas eat em
Mr. kane, mr. magic, dog a bitch quick
Hit that trick from the back and let her suck my brother dick
We don't sweat these hoes, we let these hoes
Find em, fuck em, duck em and forget these hoes
I need fresh money everyday bitch have my cash
Try to short game or run game get shot in the ass
Understand you da hoe and I'm the pimp
All paper comes to me, see you the gimp
Put some stretchmarks on that pussy and fuck till you limp
When the sun goes down you gonna do it again

(abel)
I started off two hoes on the block for me
Now it's two hundred hoes wanna shop with me

Chorus: (magic, kane & abel)

Look, I got a proposition every gimp needs a pimp
If you about gimpin' then we about pimpin
(repeat 4x)

(big ed)
It ain't nothing like black pussy on my dick
My tank dawgs said never put my faith in a bitch
All females ain't hoes, I love the ladies
But gimps get tag team freaks in backseats of jeeps
I'm that big dick nigga drivin up ya street
Big dick nigga got em going mouth to me
I'll hit ya in ya grill hole if you want it there
I'll even watch you eat your girl's pussy I don't care
I'll hit you from the back, slap your ass and pull your hair
Wrap around rub your clit through your pubic hairs
Women call me the assassin cause they know I'm gone kill it
I fuck your pussy so hard I make ya momma feel it

(mac)
Now where the gimps, I slam em like shawn kemp
I guess I'm a born pimp cause I never eat it, still I complete it
My name mac so motherfuckers know where my game at
I fuck em and duck, give em wrong numbers and what
Camouflage love all night making you moan
Yeah I get mine and I'm gone but I gotta go finish my song
Look you ain't gotta go home but you gotta leave
Now straighten up your weave
And call me soon as you make it to your crib please
And I'm gone give you a beep next time I want to creep
Wouldn't give a fuck if you sleep, wake up and greet it's me
I like them thug girls y'all can have them pretty hoes
Them giddy hoes ain't good for nothing but videos

Chorus 4x

No disrespecting my sisters, I'm disrespecting you bitches
Scandalous hoes sucking and fucking for a nigga's riches
Keep your hands out my pockets ho cause I'm a pimp
You can't play this fucking player that's why I treat you like a gimp
You ain't nothing but a fuck or two
So if you ain't got no cash then I really don't want your ass
I'm bout bigger and fucking better
If you really want me then bring the cheddar
And I promise you that you'll never need another fellow
Treat ya like daddy but be sure to call me magic
And if I ever catch you stashing, girl I'm gone let you have
When a nigga call you, call me and I decide (hmmm...)
Whether this nigga deserves the pussy...trust me
Sign your name on the dotted line and if you ever need this nigga
Just call me I ain't hard to find

Chorus 4x

What you don't get it or something...
No limit carry nothing but pimps and motherfucking players.

Suck a dick bitch.

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a

Fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact

We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers over exaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

[Chorus: 2X]

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

I ride with you niggas whether you right or wrong

I wasn't born with none of you niggas but we be come from the same hood
Fifty dollars gave birth and y'all treated me good
Think I was family so if any nigga disrespect
I'm a grab him and shake him till I break his fuckin neck
Ain't no bottom to this love I go to the ends of the earth
To ensure as long as you with Magic you'll never be hurt
To mentally and physically prepared for gangsta shit
And I pray to my chances of survival rollin with this click
I throw myself in the line of fire to die with a good name
Fuck the fame, let it be said I was made by the game
Found a friend when you found me
And I'm dedicated to TRU so it's alright to put your faith in me

Got my tank on shine so it's hard for you not to look at me
Face it, I'm legendary, I'm the first of my kind
I'm makin money nationwide, it's only my first time
I'm in a no lose situation with Beats By The Pound
Whole shit platinum cause no one around to fuck with the sound
No greater love then being affiliated with y'all
But we all stand together so together we fall

Look here, it's not easy I struggled to get in this position
Taking my people out the ghetto was my only mission
I was jacking and strong arming accomplished i done changed
Making money living good I'm out of the game
See as I refused to see good in my accomplishments
All I ever get is dirty looks, never compliments
I figure jealousy, wishing that why'all could be me
Cause I'm living larger then life at the age of twentythree (ha ha)
a lot of pessimistic people is speaking about my lifestyle
So when I enter the center I look for the smiles
Many expected me to go down the tubes
Now the same people wishing that they could be in my shoes
But I'm the one they call hopeless
Lord forgive em for thinking that I was worthless
I forgive and forget
And I learn from every life experience
I hope why'all feel every word cause this is real it gets

They said I'm hopeless and I never make it
They doubt it, call me an outcast because I'm bout it
Now why you want to label me and say I'm a thug
I never said I wasn't because this ghetto is in my blood
But I maintain through poverty and tears
My only wish was that I make it to see another year
I left my dreams up in the penn, feel my constant struggle
And one man against a nation, damn I miss my brother
I walk a path to a dead end cause I'm lonely
A childhood full of rainy days kept me homeless
I always wondered was I cursed
Since birth I felt I never had a fair chance in life on this wreched earth
My lonely memories of the past, they got me thinking
I don't want to see the future, but die in vain
I ask the Lord will he forgive me
Before I leave this world I want to live a better life because I'm hopeless

Just a bad motherfucker, my classroom was the hallways
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Only thing that ever mattered was that my peers respected me
Living fast at a young age so them hoes was sweating me
Thinkin' I'm a grown man
I'm holding rocks in my mouth, tryin' to survive in this crime land
I'm just hustling cause I never had
So these chips that I gained, I maintained, me and my pops past
I thank the Lord for blessing me, I owe you eternity
So I fall to my knees whenever I'm addressing him
You walked me down the right path
Even though my heart was in it
You made me realize that sky is the limit

[Chorus]
Sky is the limit
And I won't stop until I touch the top
And I won't stop till I reach the top
And I'm not stopping, and I'm not stopping
Sky is the limit
And I won't stop until I touch the top
And I won't stop till I reach the top
And I'm not stopping

You know a sister went from sheets on the windows and matresses on the floor
To a house sittin on the acre with a lotta paper
Money market accounts, CD's and savings
Mutual funds, but I remember barely having ones
For real yall, George Washingtons
Had about five to get by for the whole week sometimes
Why, I used to cry to the lord
How a young black sister get it so hard
Two babies to raise all by myself, help wanted
I see the tank comin through so I jumped on it
And took a ride with some soldiers where the sky is the limit
No Limit, TRU for life and I'm a represent it
And now there's no more hungry nights
Or duckin from then niggas in the projects shootin out the lights
Ghetto flowers, your time is coming in a minute
So stand your ground and stay focused, sky is the limit

[Chorus]

I'm a product of this cruel world so my life's a fact of misery
And in my sleep I'm paintin' pictures of my enemies
Ain't no stopping me cause of my status on the incline
And I'd die tryin' to get mine
Picture me a TRU nigga
Drinkin' Don Periogne, I'm affiliated with mob figures
And I'm loving this life of luxury
I'm in the passenger seat of a 98 Navigator with my nigga C
Talkin' over another million dollar hit
Another million dollar nigga is added to the click
Mo money mo clout, I guess we takin' over
The world is ours cause we No Limit soldiers
I thank the Lord for blessin' me
And lettin' nothin' stressin' me
And showin' me that TRU records was my destiny
And I'll be in the living legends, no gimmicks
A made nigga, cause the sky is the limit

[Chorus]

Yo, I made this one here for all the ladies that wanna get with me.
All the niggas that wanna hate me.

You fuck up, I'm a kill ya, and I put that shit on TRU 

See I'm that type of nigga that ride with the rich, kick it with the poor 

Just 'cause of some shit that I used to do, and my rep 

Everybody see me, all of a sudden hit the floor 

Rest in peace to my nigga, go head and rest y'all head 

Nigga that killed ya, I'm torturin' him, the rest, they dead 

So Magic pass me them thangs and let me get 'em (let me get 'em) 

Nah I ain't lookin' for you dog

Dollar bills will stay stackin' and gold and platinum on the wall (wall) 

Yeah, I'm that type of nigga but I'm wrong 'cause I know I'd hit her(hit her) 

Right before I leave and drop some of my flows 

So when he come on home, you can kill her 

Now either you with me dog look , or you oppossed to my shit

I got to be real with ya, I'm that type of nigga that really don't give a fuck 

My hobbies was totin' tecks Jack and my first words were give it up 

It was hard to maintain, couldn't see myself workin' this 9 to 5 

I'd rather be hustlin' on the corner with my niggas, gettin' high 

Chancin' my own life, I'm strapped, got a pocketful of bud 

But I wouldn't have it no other way, my daddy done raised a thug 

I never rooted for the good guys, I was always for the bad (bad) 

I guess that's why I got Master P's pictures posted around my pad 

My ghetto heroes was drug dealer, killers and cap peelers 

I didn't do too bad for myself 'cause, now Magic makin' millions 

Me and Silkk unbeatable team we can't be stopped (can't be stopped) 

We ain't got nothin' to prove to nobody (nothin') 

Fuck wit' us, you get popped 

It's a brand new generation, and we the children of the future 

So I'm gon' do what I gotta do because that's what I'm used to

Prepared to rip a nigga down if he look at me long enough

That's why these killers and they old ladies be coming after me
They won't be no more after me including my body faculity
Look at my name, I'm to blame for all these casualties
No one as bad as me, I search the galaxy
And I'm willing to put up my no limit royal salary
Go ahead make my manner please if the yapping don't decease
When I stomp, you ? ? ? , get up and catch a breeze
I ain't lying I'm horrifying, I'm the bull up in the pit

Still keeping it real, smoking weed, drinking hennessey

I'm gettin fucked up so how many wanna ride with me
If you got a blunt get it lighted, come get high with me
I like to smoke till my lungs can't take no more
Got me ducking and diving like I'm strung out on coke
But still one of the most dangerous niggas you ever came across
Better cock my shit and bust until they label you lost
With no remorse, me, fiend, big ed goin be all right

Where the fuck my niggas at, let's get this party started

Now when I said fuck y'all niggas, best believe that I meant it
For every bullet that hit your dome best believe my gat sent it
Niggas talk shit and repent it, cause they know my hollows did shit
I'm back on the streets as a hitman cause my stash is gone I spent it
Gotta jack you for your paper, I'm a no limit terminator
Hit you like a gladiator, shake you like an alligator
What's up now bitch, when I hit your town get shot or duck down
? ? ? ? ? get buck down, two sheds get high no time for showdown
Slow down, I got my gat all in your face
Don't make me sound this bitch off like I'm about to start a race
And leave your head all over the place now that ain't no fun

Packin pistols wasn't even in my frame of thought 
We had a problem it was understood that we fought
And Money wasn't even on my most wanted list
It wasn't really necessary just to pull a check
And even though I didn't have a dad, 
I used to thank the lord everyday for everything I had
To all my lost thugs i miss ya well, 
I can't forget ya I got ya picture in my cell
and uh I never use ya name in vane,

You never saw your son face to face but rest a sure that ya family straight

Watchin koochie pass waitin for the bell to ring, 
cause i got a pocket full a dirt that I'm gonna blow on my friends
I'm headin straight to the streets where i learn the game, 
me and my niggas rushin home where we stashed our cane
I went from student to dope dealer hangin out with straight killers, 
i did better til i met the Millers
I remember livin lies slowly doin so bad so broke i had no where to go 
I was wearin the first pair a Jordan's after the fourth pair came out
I messed around and dropped out tryin to make me some clout
I never worried about my education I was confused 
I thought thugs ran the nation until I got on probation, 
I remember that's why i thank the lord every day 
took me out the game showed me the right way to get paid

With my arms open hopin God could tell me why babies die 
Why my cousin Fish keep smokin, mama told me say a prayer 
And it'll ease the pain you think Mouse before he died

Hold me a place in his new house cause so many nights

Wakin' up my neighbors poppin' pistols in the air 
Tryin' make a million pullin' all night flights I'm praying 'cause I'm
knowin that my life ain't right
Forgive 'cause I'm wrong but I'm begging or forgiveness
And now I'm hustlin' in a whole other business
Tryin' to do right for the people that I hurt 
in the process of growin up
I've change my ways i guess that's why I'm blowin up
I'm comin' back for all my peeps   
Just try to stay alive and keep your ass off the streets
For the ones that gotta hustle just to eat

y'all can feel my pain
A lot of years wasted, buku friends died a lot of wet faces
The other half caught a bunch of fuckin' cases
So still a lot of tender spaces  
Wish I could erase the hate
Who said money makes you happy?
It can never bring back my daddy 
So fuck the Navi and Caddie

I saw your other side, but fuck it I'm mad
You say a lot of shit but you never ponit the finger
I'm guessin' that Mr. Magic gon' remember
Surprisin' a lot of so called superstars 
Passive comments but really don't want go to war
Not with me my reputation stands for itself
Just pull the disc out can't keep it on the shelf go and get it like
it's the last one left
I work the piss out the people who press 'em
I thank the lord for such a wonderful blessin'
Every word that I speak is a lesson 
hard to believe that this nigga is from the projects 

Chorus",Soldier,1999
Magic,"Magic talking:

I'm that motherfucking nigga everyone asking about.
y'all know who the fuck this is.
That nigga nigga Mr. Magic. (huh)
That nigga nigga Mr. Magic.

Chorus x2

That's me motherfucker that's me (Who that is be with P?)
That's me motherfucker that's me (Who that is be with see?)
That's me motherfucker that's me 
I'm the one they call Mr. fucking Magic

Verse 1: 

I treat the mic like a blunt so watch Mr. Magic get high
spitting lyrical fire 'til they day i die
y'all remember me as that shadow that jumped out of the midst
making hit after hit and got the whole rap game pissed
Got 'em wondering where I came from
straight from hell the first nigga to make Lucifer run
You underestimate my consistency
Look like you waiting a weak verse nigga you might as well get rid of me
Mad cause you can't trigger me
Which angle is I come from, mad cause you can't catch me son
I already won and believe the best is yet to come
I'll be flippin MC's until the day that I'm deceased
and got every record label waiting on my contract to be released
I mean all in the pentenaries, niggas is probably mentioning me
Give or take a couple of years, I'll be the man eventually
You can't stop what supposed to be
I'm the one, I'm the chosen man, That's ME

Chorus x2

Verse 2: 

I'm the whisper you can hear in every project hall
the conversation you can hear through every crack in the wall
the funny noises you can hear in your house when it's dark
the biggest upset in years cause I'm at the top of the charts
got niggas wondering why the fuck they struggling
I guess that's a fucked position that Magic put you in
But it's my turn so give me some breathing room
you ain't on a nigga's ass killer but that's cool
It's all to be expected shit you let me know I'm competition 
but there's a lot more to me that you niggas couldn't even vision
give you a run for your money and bitch I'll take your shit
I'll run your pussy ass home like a bitch
See ain't no studio up in me, better not offend me
I'll rape Barney and kill Officer Friendly
shoot at the sheriff and the motherfucking deputy
See I'm the one you looking for motherfucker that's ME

Chorus x2 

Verse 3: 

Just name a designated time and a designated place
point them niggas out and  I promise they be erased
Ain't a fake bone in my body, If I did I'd take it out
In front of the whole world so nobody would have doubt
that nobody could take me out, I'm just in a half-clout
Forgive me if I'm wrong but my money is what I'm bout
My dope is high coat, smoking po-po till I die
trying to make a couple mill 'fore the age of 25
I spin and been like a motherfucking tornado
cut your from nose to navel, now that shit gonna potato
It's kinda hard to believe that a nigga like me from the see-T-see
Went from serving fiends to posing in magazines
Nigga we hustled on the same corner
the only difference is my hustle was a little stronger
I say you should go and fear, you got the right worry
cause I was created to make end careers early, ya heard me?
That's me motherfucker that's me (huh)
That's me motherfucker that's me (nigga nigga what)
That's me motherfucker that's me (nigga nigga what)
I'm the one they call Mr. fucking huh what

Now when you shake that ass, I get rocked up
You got a boyfriend boo (Wodie, my man locked up)

Got a nigga saying ""Ohhh girl""
Come a little closer, I'm trying to make you out my boo girl
Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that

I like freaking at your man's house, when he leave I toot
What would he say if he knew that I was sexing you

(C-Murder)
Let me see you wobble then shake it, then baby pop it, don't break it
You want love let's make it, I just can't wait 'til you naked

What about the tower called Wilt Chamberlain
And Kareem, got us in the game again
Bill Russell, won eleven NBA championships
Walt Frazier, he could be better known as a pimp
Elgin Baylor, made shooting three-pointers look easy
Magic Johnson, in my opinion there was no better leading

For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed

For every cop that done chased me
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn

It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone

'Cause I like what you do me, yeah
Come on, let's keep it short and simple

I'm feeling this flame with you, doin' this thing with you
Keeping it real with you, baby
I'm a thug and you notice, I already show this
If you haven't noticed, shawty

I got to get me a dime, make it clear all the time
Pussy stay on my mind that's why I stay on the grind
After every show I'm hitting the hojo
Flocking women behind me, walkin' my mojo

Never solo, that's a no, no breaker breaker
Is you feeling me? that's a 10, 4
I don't need no X, all I need is some dro, give you a couple
Baby, I got to go, to youngen's in my idol

Got women's by the dozen, always follow my model
Never tell them you love them
Keep them thinking its cool, baby we just friends
If you looking for more, then baby, it's gotta end

let's keep it short and simple, you know
That's just the way it needs to be
Don't you like it what I do you?
'Cause I like what you do me, yeah
Come on, let's keep it short and simple

You want to be my main squeeze, 'cause I can
Take care of your needs, put you right to sleep
I do that with E's, start looking for a thug
And stop looking for love

We can do some dirty and sweep it under the rug
Keep it in the closet, don't know shit don't start it
I got a fetish for red bones, especially with thongs on
I see them in them, damn

Got to holding my ding dong
Rumors you heard about me, yeah they true
Turning hoes into house wives, that's what I do
My staff is starving, and I can hear that pussy calling

I'm trying to murder your private, go with it, don't fight it
It?s been deprived, let me get it excited, stop stressing
If I don't call you back, don't trip
'cause you really you wanted that

let's keep it short and simple, you know
That's just the way it needs to be
Don't you like it what I do you?
'Cause I like what you do me, yeah
Come on, let's keep it short and simple
Come on, let's keep it short and simple

You're not in love with me, baby
You like the thug in me, baby
I think you're really in love with my money
I still like to fuck with you, baby

I know you're hot for me mama
Love when I kill the punana
I like it better without all this drama
No need to step across them lines

let's keep it short and simple, you know
That's just the way it needs to be
Don't you like it what I do you?
'Cause I like what you do me, yeah
Come on, let's keep it short and simple

Magic,"[Intro]
I'm trying hard, just to find my way
(find my way, find my way)
Over and over to the Lord, I pray
(the Lord I pray, the Lord I pray)
I'm smoking weed, just to ease my mind
(to ease my mind, to ease my mind)
I'm steady debating, cause niggaz is hating
But Lord knows, it'll be alright

[Hook]
I'm trying hard, just to find my way
Hoping I can see, a brighter day
Over and over, to the Lord I pray
Hoping everything, will be ok
I'm smoking weed, just to ease my mind
Through all these tribulations, of my life
I'm steady debating, cause niggaz is hating
But Lord knows, it'll be alright

[Magic]
Before we get to whatever promised, no show together prize at the end for us
Simply convinced that the streets, is the only friend to us
Send us a comfort that'll, heal our hate
To raise what's great and expose what's fake, and pray that release is tired
But we don't, deserve to lead
Before complaining on the, difference from your want's and need's
I've been appointed my word and on it, help you through your high's and low's
Show you don't have to be afraid, no mo'
I love my sisters, but we done put em down sometime
Independent, easily baited by the things that shine
Crying inside completed perfect, beauty couldn't change what was issued
The love that she looking's for, one that this world can't give her
Rock on mama you're precious, nothing changed but life
Bang them pockets with your profit, comes a dangerous price
Shhh, hell couldn't keep us in shackles
We head over heals with the demons in back of us, sitting soldier for having

[Hook]

[Magic]
I'm sick and tired, of being sick and tired
And I'm sick of dealing with niggaz, and all these fucking liars
I keep my head in the sky, and pray that my niggaz make it
My pockets aching, you getting my way of life I'm taking
See I've been rapping too long, to say that I'm doing base I suppose to be balling
So please stay out my fucking face, welcome to the Vault nigga
We keep it gutter, but keep it real in the same breath
Quiet as kept, you niggaz ain't seen nothing yet
I humble my heart, hoping to keep this fire contained
The world pressured me to murder, I got's no one to blame
Still the same trying to change, but these streets calling
Hurting my own kind, cause Mr. Magic love balling
Hoping my mama, don't think she brought me or taught me to hate
She just delivered me it's in my heart, believe me it's faith
My mind is boggled at times, I sit and wait for the signs
God gon deliver this anger, give me a piece of mind

[Hook]

[Magic]
We in an everlasting struggle, the objective's to win my nigga
Nothing pretend, we'll worry with every spin my nigga
Treated my wounds, just took a second to heal neglect
Comfort the soul, that know the sun'll only shine a second
With no concerns in it, maybe we'll change in time
Shoot for the stars, and let what's artificial lag behind
Now I'll be careful, who I'm hurting while I choose my foes
Later the same hands I'll help, and to feed and clothe me
Be the life of whatsoever, I'm allowed to reach
Preposition to be the voice, of what's afraid to speak
Baptized in fire, called in the face of Christ
Till we expire, free to stumble at the steps of life
A cruel world said the ghetto, to be fast asleep
Vowing to never give us someting, we allowed to keep
For real and fake, same spot in a casket we
Grew old too soon and smart too late, you feel that

[Hook]",So Tired,2003
Magic,"Sick with it nigga, yeah
Ninth Ward, should of never woke me up
Bad nigga, can't stop
Can't fuck with me, look here

Popping pistols at random
When the smoke clears, I'll be the only nigga standing
I won't leave a witness, I'm a thug what you don't see the killa in my eyes
With this fire arm, sitting on my side
Been patiently waiting, for a victim to step out of the crowd
So I could prove, why they label me wild
I'm sick and psychotic I got a problem, I'm addicted to thugging
Fuck what you say, cause I ain't wanting for nothing look here

This for my gangsta ass niggaz, in the club
Throw up your set, if you a mo'fucking thug
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up
This for my niggaz that's, still on the grind
Nothing but pussy, and money up on your mind
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up

I'm sick with mine, you could feel the heat in the flow
You see the crowd start to bucking, when I walk in the do'
I'm real with mine, nigga I ain't the one you should beef with
I keep's my bitch and, that ain't the one that I sleep with
Am I still a soldier, nah you could keep it
I'm a ninth Ward nigga, and that ain't no secret
Want me, to cross over
Understand, I still lay that I'm over
I'm use to capping the hood, on my shoulders
Ghetto representative, here's nothing colder here's nothing boulder
I was kept in the shade, didn't want me to shine
But I done broke the chains, and I'm back for what's mine
I done ditched the tank, and replaced it with a nine
If I die I'ma die, amongst my own kind
Nigga I'm from the Crescent, I'm bout whatever you thought
Make a move, and I'm blasting with no question

This for my gangsta ass niggaz, in the club
Throw up your set, if you a mo'fucking thug
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture

Fuck safety, keep the mo'fucker cocked
You got a thug nigga wit ya, I'm hoping you get the picture
We could tear this mo'fucking club up

And to my niggaz locked down, Mac-A-Don and see
I can't wait for the day, that they tell me you free
So until your lawyers tell me, that your cases are won
I'ma keep the fire burning, like it's 'spose to be done
Fuck my past, you better keep a eye on my future
Bringing the competition, that these rappers ain't use to
Making the type of statement, that these rappers'll work from
If you think I'm scared, you don't know where I come from
I'm use to getting packages, by the lump some
I ain't hard to find, I'm in the 9 if you want some
Teflon Don, pistol grip pump
Crazy glued to my palm, better sound the alarms

I'm feeling like a blooder day, I'm doing big things
Moving in a major way (hey), pocket full of big faces
And them haters wishing they could trade places, but face it
You ain't the balla type, you don't know how to dress when you rocking ice
You don't know how to shop, and ignore the price
You don't know, how to never wear the same thing twice
I could jump in a designer suit, with fresh braids
Ain't gotta spit no game, I'm getting leid
That's the things that come in life, when you paid
What can I say (hmmm), I got it made
Blessed with a sexy voice, hey boo

I don't know nothing bout, no Van Gogh
Spending money is a hobby, I never stop in a hotel lobby
I keep the presidential suite, on lock for me
First class, everything I do is VIP
Whoa, big pimping spending cheese
Bling bling, got a car sitting under my sleeve
Damn slow me down, cause I'm out of control
Got a stack in my pocket, that refuse to fold
So I throw away the hundreds, that look too old
And I change women more, than I change my clothes

This for my niggas, 9th Ward bound
Cross the canal, and the CTC
I'm still thuggin' nigga, ha-ha
Ya heard me

[Magic]
Ain't nothing changed, still struggling trying to make an advance
I got a little loot, but I'm tired of spending hundreds of grands
I'm trying to blow a mill you feel me, never even missing
And me and my niggas have been rude, getting fitted
We destined to ball, we different from y'all
y'all like to shop, but we'd rather buy out the mall
Gots no friends, I gots to keep the fam with me
Has no pity gon bust bust, until empty
Out of love nigga, I...full of blood nigga
As somebody getting drugged nigga
I tried changing, but I guess this shit is deep in the blood
I guess that's why my mama calls me a thug, but still

[Chorus]
Take a walk through my hood
And everything seems to be a-o.k
See my niggas on the block still hustling
Living life, day by day
Don't get mad at us, just understand
That that's the way, playas play
Society done showed us the money
And the cars, and made us this way

We forever be some hustlers, don't trust us
Because we motherfucking hustlers - 4x

[Magic]
Now you can call me greedy
But I envy niggas balling harder
Then up comes, the 9th Ward shit starter
I'm the definition, it don't gets no clearer
Genuine, hundred percent, thug nigga
Full of fire, try me feel my flames
And let me prove, ain't a damn thang changed
Uh-huh, I'm thuggin' for my niggas, let it be heard
I represent the 9th no, disrespect to the Third
I got a obligation to show the world, how we thuggin'
How we does it, Orleans buzzers, I'll be there for you cousin
To smoke with you, choke with you, maybe crack a joke with you
Cause I use to be broke with you

We hustlas, we hustlas
Uh-huh, we motherfucking hustlas
I said we hustlas, nigga we hustlas
Uh-huh, we motherfucking hustlas

25 years of bullshit, 25 years of
Stashing rocks, under my lip
25 years of trying to get rich quick, trying to hit a lick
Trying to make a dolla, out of fifteen cents
I hustler harder than the average, kidnapping
And jacking, happens to be my favorite
See I did this on the regular nigga
I move swift like the Predator, nigga
To anialate my competitor, and to add to my decimals
See I ran with professionals, niggas
With big testicles, that's down for whatever
Put my life on the line, to keep my family straight
You niggas die when you in my way, motherfuckers

I did this here for my mo'fuckers, I ain't gon lie

You ain't tripping off, of knowing that I get around
That's why I'm digging you mama, because you still down
Yeah, we had our fuss and fights, but that's life
Leave mad, but I'm coming back home the same night
Say a couple things, to rub you wrong
It's make up time, baby tonight it's on
Something bout the way, that you making me feel
Keep me hustling, don't worry bout a damn bill
Just keep the loving coming, like when we touching stomachs
I get this chill up my spine, I'm so glad that that ass is mine

Got me hooked on, everything that you do

I ain't satisfied, 'till you climax
It's all about you mama, is you feeling that
See I know, my woman's work
She's here when I'm happy, and here when I'm hurt
You make me want to stay home, leave my niggaz alone
'Cause you give a nigga the freedom, to go out and roam
You that twinkle, in a nigga's eyes

When I'm flying from state to state
Let me know girl (will you be there)

I always keep the 4-4, what, what

You fucking with niggaz, that's 'bout chilling
You fucking with niggaz, that's 'bout killing and digging a lot of holes
You playing with grown men, that'll beat you to mush
No matter the money or power, you could be touched

Ashes to ashes, nigga, dust to dust
You shorten your own life when you fuck with us
See, I was nurtured by the bosom of the block
That told me in a heated situation, grab the glock and pop

Until it stops and never turn back, you understand
Soon as you feel remorse, them niggaz got the upper hand
You'll never catch this nigga slipping
My peripheral vision, one big up on your own intentions so

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe

They won't survive, they'll tell you I'm a hell of a man
I devour the weak and dissesemble the strong
So called rappers with song after song

When will the world understand that I can't be stopped
It won't be as easy as it was with Pac
I'm smarter now, took a situation and learned
Can't trust a nigga 'cause niggaz'll get you burned

Watch paparazzi, a lot of stories'll turn
Trying to get you killed, behind the same money you earn
Shot my dog, scared of the power that he possessed
But it ain't over nigga, guess who's next

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe
Or sipping on a taste of mo-mo
I never leave the crib without the fo'-fo', that's a no-no

Give me a reason, I'll open fire like it's kill-a-nigga season
You heathens don't deserve breathing
I suck the life out of your body with every word that I speak
And when I'm finished, I'm hoping that that you deceased

I keep my enemies close, watch they moves, I ain't no fool
Just because I dropped out of school
It's called common sense and street smarts
Too much heart'll get you tossed in the park, nigga, lost in the dark

I live the laws of my land, where it's kill or be killed
So don't question if this pistol in my hand is real
Don't question if the stories that you heard are real
Just understand, nigga, this is how I was born for real

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe

If I let you live, then pray nigga cause you been lucked out
Ahh I abuse you, and the shadow behind you

Neglecting my nuts I work too much
Fuck gettin' tipsy tryin' to get fucked up

Eyes focused on pussy
Run some G on a damn broad

So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game
All the casualties, got us caught up in the game
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game

Picture this drama, that we stuck in
Lookin' for ways to keep from hustlin'
I wasn't born to be nothin'
And my muthafuckin' life is cursed
And I plan to see these streets for everything it was worth
And my momma lookin' at me like I was dead in a burst
Since the loss of my uncle,
My pain it got worse And it hurts to see my
Momm fallin' down in tears
And to me, my life ain't clear
Got me livin' in fear
Sheddin' tears, for my dead peers
Who's to blame for my muthafuckin' 
Pain that I'm feelin' inside

Well nigga don't cry keep your head up and roll wit' this pressure
Control this pain that you feelin' 'cause it's only to test ya
Drama, I've been in since I left the wooms of my momma
Still trynna cope wit situations left behind me
Will I ever find another way even though I pray
Judgement day ain't far away from what my momma say
But I'm trapped in this thug livin' and thug sinnin' heavenly father
Forgive me for all my drug dealin' pressure and pain

I'm surrounded by so much drama, every day I visualize
Walk the streets wondering I'mma die or stay alive
I could recall bein' bad on the streets hustlin' for mine
I use to hustle wit' dimes
Now I'm hustlin' wit' rhymes
The FED's is watchin',
The police is crooked everywhere that a nigga go,
The law trynna book me
I grew up in the ghetto I'm sheddin' tears
And livin' in fear
Late at night, trynna sleep, shots rang out my ears
I'm present in this game, I feel the end is close
The other day I could've sworn I see a fuckin' ghost
It's hard to survive in the fuckin' N.O.
You never know when it's yo time to go

They got me livin' in a world that's full of despise
I can't cope wit' the authorities wit' this red in my eyes
So I proceed across the battlefield bustin' for glory
These demons preachin' for my soul, but I be damned if I'm buried
I got shit to live for I got dreams to forfill
If I die today or tomorrow, who gon' pick up the steel
Don't let mind deceive ya, you either kill or get killed
You muthafuckas ain't feelin' me, so it's best you get real
These fuckin' laws got a nigga stressin' but I'm a thug
Ain't no love on these streets for blacks wit' drawin' blood
Crooked cops tryin' to throw all us blacks n the rump
But lord protect us til' we make it home

It's my time
I can feel your pain
Nigga now allow me to spit some game
Watch these stanky bitches beware a nigga that's lame
You can die in the hands of a coward, so keep your eyes open
I done seen a lot of hard niggas die wit' their chest smokin'
But have no worry Gambino family 'cause I'm on your side
If any of them break your tradition, then I'll be down to ride
Let no man question my dedication

Gotta jack you for your paper, I'm a no limit terminator
Hit you like a gladiator, shake you like an alligator

I give a shout to my mom she was there for me, 
even though sometimes i felt she never cared for me
Packin pistols wasn't even in my frame of thought 
We had a problem it was understood that we fought
And Money wasn't even on my most wanted list
It wasn't really necessary just to pull a check
And even though I didn't have a dad, 
I used to thank the lord everyday for everything I had
To all my lost thugs i miss ya well, 
I can't forget ya I got ya picture in my cell
and uh I never use ya name in vane,

You never saw your son face to face but rest a sure that ya family straight

cause i got a pocket full a dirt that I'm gonna blow on my friends
I'm headin straight to the streets where i learn the game, 
me and my niggas rushin home where we stashed our cane
I went from student to dope dealer hangin out with straight killers, 
i did better til i met the Millers
I remember livin lies slowly doin so bad so broke i had no where to go 
I was wearin the first pair a Jordan's after the fourth pair came out
I messed around and dropped out tryin to make me some clout
I never worried about my education I was confused 
I thought thugs ran the nation until I got on probation, 
I remember that's why i thank the lord every day 
took me out the game showed me the right way to get paid

Two different cultures, but had the same heart (yeah)

Fifth album, bumped heads in the parking lot (aight)
Was a quiet brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came direct (uh), when he came, gained respect
So I gave respect, (uh) we shared the same respect

Two brothers with good hearts, but if you start
Two brothers that'll hurt you (yeah)

To accept the fact, that you won't be coming back
But I hope you coming back, 'cause I won't accept the fact
When you came to New York, you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa, (yeah), that's just how we did
Remote control cars, (what), we would race all day

Carry on the light, before the night is gone
the spirits of delight is free for everyone.
Carry on the light, before the night is gone
sing your song, for the princess of the dawn.

[1# Rap]
The journey's hard as I run to my castle,
the war is on, but the mind feels hassle,
of love and hate, bad and great.
My queen is there but still I have to wait.
For a woman, degree's a must.
360'..,Girl come with me.
Because the knight needs a life to lean on.
From morning to night until the break of dawn.
Full awareness, never careless.
Caress, oh yes, she has to have finesse,
So bring it on if you fit the picture,
then I'll get wit'cha and drop my scripture.
'cause the P-are-O-be	-L-A-see-K,
needs a queen to fit me today.
And if you're ready to let go,
then check the Swift as I start flow.

[2# Rap]
A hard day's job, has come and now gone,
step in the room, and what I feel is gloom,
'cause it's empty, no one to greet me.
Pain jumps in, only the mirror to meet me.
So I sit on back, write my text,
ink flows through out to I flex and plex
not a love letter, only a live getter,
pen after pen, as the paper get wetter,
the warrior, lyrical courier,
needs an amazon, and a strong type lover,
what's it gonna be, a simp or me ""G"".
Emotconal concept or a technicality,
not new to the game, so what's up?
Gimme your heart or else stay apart.
And I'll accept one or the other.
Princess or not, I'm still the true brother.",Carry On,1999

Magic Affair,"Maniac? the name is Swift 
Homicidal the title, to take a life as a gift 
Cold crush, rhyme, rhyme, lady, scratch, and even music maker 
Bounce an' MC on the court like a ball player 
Proven by the lyrics on the mike as I extend the cut 
Making music, as the girls move and shale their butts 
Suckers with the heart, try to battle even cheat me 
They can't compete, nor they defeat, or even beat me 
With the silly dictionary rhymes they spond 
When the mike catches fire, it will melt and bend 
Then I'll use the court as a whip, as I teach this lesson 
I'll whipe the knowledga in your head, so you can't stop guessing 
Who's the best MC upon the MIC, SWIFT 
Executed lyrics by me, will leave you violated 
Make your body get the shiversq, eyes dilated 
Suckers perpetrate, and try to dis me 
That's why the suckers watching me like TV 
Survival of the fittest, is very vital 
Got my weapon on auto, boy, I'm homicidal 

Dangerous, mike packing and ill 
My poetry is my ammo, and it's ready to kill 
I'll put your head out with a quickness if we battle you know 
I'll make you wish you were in prison, sitting on death row 
Chrome plated, highly polished, and I'm running the joint 
I penetrate, like a hollow point 
Homicidal, is what I feel in my mind 
I have 100 ways to kill you while I'm saying this rhyme 
Perpetrators, can't even compare to this 
I cock the hammer, pull the trigger and dis 
Sucker MCs biting rhymes like these 
I'll point my weapon in your face and then I'll start to squeeze

because a butt-kickings, what you're getting 
I lived a rough life from kid to a man 
When I think of things I've done I say ""Damn !""

Menace I'm homicidal 

Swift the name, dissin' MCs the game, 
To dis a sucker MC is the claim of my fame 
I like to grabthem by the face, punching them in the neck 
Burning up their stale rhymes, 'till they give me respect 
Cold destruction is a code, causing rapper's commotion 
Setting world on fire like a TNT explosion 
Rhyme, not a song, I neither sang nor I sung 
I can cut a man to shreds, or break a tree with my tongue 
Got my face on a poster, wanted dead or alive 
Reward tall ""duckies"" four thousand or five 
If you want to take the ""duckies"" wish yourself a good luck 
'cause I kill in cold bood and I don't give a fuck 
Come along or bring your posse, play brave and the bold 
I'll be rocking, cold shocking, 'till I'm 80 years old 
Proud and I'm black, giving squeezers no slack 
I'm even deadlier then PCP caine and crack

Magic Dream Orchestra,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2009

Y llorare, y moriré, no quiero seguir sin tu amor

Te canto hoy pues no me queda otro remedio
Lo hago así para que sepas que soy serio
Estoy aquí por que no tengo otro consuelo que verte a ti
(Que verte a ti)

Ahora quiero que te asome a la ventana
Para que sepa lo que tengo aquí en mi alma
No hay otro ser que me devuelva a mí las ganas solo tú

Oye mi amor, no me digas que no
Tú mereces todo lo que soy
Ven descúbrelo

Oye mi amor, no me digas que no
Porque el tiempo es del corazón
Dame tu amor

Sin presión corazón
Nos vamos pa' la acción
No me digas que no
Y escucha la razón

Pon atención
Me gustas un montón
Me pongo como cocolón
Cuando te muerdes el temor

Es algo físico, científico, verídico
Es algo pyscho, algo critico
Una adicción que se convierte en concreta
Soy tu Romeo y tu mi Julieta la neta

Yo me derrito solo con esa mirada
Y esos labios hacen que me vuelva nada
Al verte cerca siento todo y casi nada
Pierdo el control

Pudiera ser que yo no sea de tu clase
Pero no pierdes nada si me das un chance
Mil años es muy poco tiempo para amarte
Dame un millón
Oye mi amor, no me digas que no

Tú mereces todo lo que soy
Ven descubrelo

Oye mi amor, no me digas que no
Porque el tiempo es del corazón

Siento desprecio porque no te tengo
Amarte, tenerte es todo lo que quiero
Mi vida sin la tuya es una noche sin luna
Que iluminas mi cielo

Ya que yo te tengo aquí
Mi alma vuelve a revivir
El cielo ya perdió su risa
Porque yo te tengo a ti

Dame la oportunidad
Te prometo que feliz serás
A las estrellas te voy a llevar
Ven conmigo baby

On the side I teach meta-ta-ta-physica, Kris is a
Master MC, challenge he, no nigga nah
Let me get this-a, clear like vinegar

Kris is the hood of America, I stay ahead of ya
What I spit will better ya, retire? Me? No, never, nah
Way too clever for cats that want me to sever this endeavor
I'm like whatever, hah

The opposite of a lie, many tried to get with this guy
But only the best can spit with this guy
It's the teacher, go on and give him a try
I take you all the way back to ba-da-bad-ba-ba-bi

Stay fly, without the flashyness my
Jewels is the gift that I apply, so I ask why
These Kentucky Fried Chicken DJ's promotin' breast and thighs
Marley Marl test these guys, it takes real eyes to realize these real lies

Oye repeta mietro
This for the hood, for the ghetto
Do the math loc or get goin
Huh, 'bout that cuenta

How can I get in the front if I ain't gettin in front
That's why I spit what I want and slide credit to pun
Lies spread it to none, rely on heaven and funds
A two-faced nigga's what I'll never become

Used to be a [unverified], now I see my rhymes get applied
To a track with two live nayendas
Marley, KRS cono dude well that makes it tres
Make a tape, no crosshairs, my aim is great

This ain't the top 8 at 8, it's Hip-Hop 88
When it wasn't all about guap' in a baby face
Back then

Soy un free ya boy, hundred percent loco see the toys
Can't win on the streets dog you need a lawyer
Use your real eyes and realize
That real lies are upon us and stop gettin cornered

Mira, Mira, the teacher
Mira, see the teacher, he a come tina rap eater
The teacher, a specialist speaker
To stand next to the leader you must be next to BE leader

We free and we strive to be freer
The one that helps you to become a better you, that's your teacher
Through these lyrics I reach ya
The truth speaker, roof reacher, proofreader, meaner no one

Challenge me? No son

A very violent flight
And you will be changed

Let me explain my situation before we even conversate 
See I'm involved with this female that just can't be replaced 
So I'm just looking for a friend are you interested? 
'Cause I would love to see you butt-naked lying in my bed 

You won't regret a mintue just tell me what you like 
And I promise to make this the best night of your life 
(Now would you dine on me?) sure baby only the best 
(Now would you treat me like a queen?) only if you can pass the first test 

Is the pussy good? ( You just got to see for yourself) 
Well is you cold with it? (Oh believe me this is the best) 
It's just me and you and I won't tell nobody 
So put your hands on my hips and let your neck get rowdy 

If you suck my soul, I'll play with your emotions 
So at the point of pentration, your wetter than the ocean 
Getting aroused by my every motion 
As I'm getting aroused by your Victoria Secret's lotion 

I'm harder than an armadillian, can't fight this feeling 
If you get on all four, shoot that ass to the ceiling 
As I apply the pressure as she starts to moan 
Ohh if it's it's on...look 

Why is you biting at that pillow baby, screaming my name? 
(Because your working that dick, you got me going insane.) 
(Boy you'se a soilder) I told ya ( How you keeping your composer?) 
'Cause right before we started, I smoked three gards of dolja 

You getting the dope dick, I prepared for this 
Wanted to dick you down before I blasted 
The plastic got the bed down better than average 
It's only been an hour and she's speaking of marriage 

I get upset, but then I start to laugh and I can't blame her 
She's been exposed to Magic, 
No other man can make her feel like I make her feel 
(Shit I ain't trippin on your wife, I'm trying to keep it real) 

So what you sayin boo? Cause I'm hoping that I'm hearing you 
I told you from the jump there was no future in this 
(So what you sayin? Don't I fulfill your biggest fantasy) 
Nah to tell you the truth baby you bothering me

Gave you the dick and it must have impressed you 
(Man you shiesty ass niggas fucking make me sick 
I wish I would have known, I would of asked you to lick my clit 

Don't you recall the day that you begged for the pussy, 
Paided for the pussy)

Magic Organ,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,1984
Magic Organ,"Peg o'my heart
I love you, don't let us part
I love you, I always knew it would be you

Your glances make my heart say ""How's chances?""
Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart
",Peg O' My Heart,1984
Magic Organ,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord?,1990
Magic Organ,"Sunset glow fades in the west, 
Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

Magic Organ,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1994
Magic Organ,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Magic Organ,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station

Magic Organ,"I met you in a garden in an old Kentucky town
The sun was shining down
You wore a gingham gown
I kissed you as I placed a yellow tulip in your hair
Upon my coat you pinned a rose so rare
Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be
 
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip

J'ai dit chéri koko see'est poulet tu veux manger
Poulet est trop petit çà peut pas te rassasier
see'est caïman braisé, je vais te donner
Kedjenou d'éléphant, tu vas manger

Nan guin nan wan, nan guin nan wan

Elle est fâché Elle dit elle s'en va à la maison
Si elle va à la maison population va me tuer
Je lui ai demandé pardon, elle a accepté
A un moment donné, elle a tout gâté
Elle est quitté dans poulet, elle s'en va dans aloco
Si see'est aloco see'est pas compliqué
see'est plantation de bananes
Tu vas griller
Au lieu de fourchette,
Ca peut pas bien piquer
see'est avec râteau, tu vas manger

'Til reality kicked in

And she said, she said she'd run away with me
So I took her to the VIP
And when the lights went on, she was gone forever

'Cause she just realized who I am
Got her past the gate, actin' like my date
Soon as she got in, started actin' fake
She ain't wanna stay close to me

Blowin' in the wind, bus to bus

Slow in her waist but as fast as they come

When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.

Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name.
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.

I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.

And living on the 9th Street
Right above a dirty bookstore
Off Euclid Avenue
And I stopped takin dope
And I quit drinkin whiskey
And my old man plays the trombone
And works out at the track

And he says that he loves me
Even though its not his baby
And he says that he'll raise him up
Like he would his own son
And he gave me a ring
That was worn by his mother
And he takes me out dancin
Every Saturday night.

And hey Charlie I think about you
Everytime I pass a fillin station
On account of all the grease
You used to wear in your hair
And I still have that record
Of Little Anthony & The Imperials
But someone stole my record player
Now how do you like that?

Hey Charlie I almost went crazy
After Mario got busted
So I went back to Omaha to
Live with my folks
But everyone I used to know
Was either dead or in prison
So I came back to Minneapolis
This time I think I'm gonna stay.

Hey Charlie I think I'm happy
For the first time since my accident
And I wish I had all the money
That we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot
And I wouldn't sell any of em
I'd just drive a different car
Every day, dependin on how
I feel

Hey Charlie for Christsakes
Do you want to know the
Truth of it?
I don't have a husband
He don't play the trombone
And I need to borrow money
To pay this lawyer

It left you scarred and scorned

Whose only human feature
Was singing the blues
Soft and low

They'd been waiting so long
To sing the blue song

mi sitio favorito en fin de semana
con la luz apagada
para ver las estrellas
hacia el sur

Tus jeans eran algo tan detestables
no permitian iniciar la batalla
echados en la hierba
me gustaba explorarte
hacia el sur

Al sur

Cuando me entrampa la melancolí­a
vuelven esos inolvidables dí­as
tu eres algo para siempre
tu eres algo para siempre
Viví­amos al tope nuestras vidas
de cara al mundo en franca rebeldí­a
tu eres algo para siempre
tu eres algo para siempre
para siempre, para siempre
para siempre, para siempre...

Hasta que un día nos pescó tu padre
y me corrió a golpes de tu vida
pocas veces nos vimos
yo emigré con los años
hacia el sur

Que me parece escuchar 
Como le laten las venas,
Quiero why no puedo why ella 
Sin mirarme entra en su portal.

Como puedo decirle que la quiero, 
Que hay un agujero en mi corazón,
Como decirle que la quiero 
Si se acerca why pierdo el control. 
Por una sonrisa
Cantaría la traviata en japonés,
Por una caricia
Iría a Venus en un barco de papel,
Pero sin embargo
Pasa por mi lado why nisiquiera me vé,
Todos los planes que hago son un fracaso, 
Estoy harto de esta timidez. 

Como puedo decirle que la quiero, 
Que hay un agujero en mi corazón,
Como decirle que la quiero 
Si se acerca why pierdo el control.

Como puedo decirle que la quiero 
Que soy casi un muñeco de guiñol,
Como decirle que la quiero
Si me falta el aire cuando la veo,
Como decirle que la quiero, 
Que hay un agujero en mi corazón,
Como decirle que la quiero 
Si no tengo ningún control.",Cómo Decirle Que La Quiero,2017

'cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life 
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs 
So watch where you put the map on the dash 
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass 
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night 
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes 
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here 
Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear! Yeah!!

I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear 
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes 
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise

Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers 
'cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters 
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors 
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches 
And niggaz cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin for figures 
This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it 
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it

You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar

Get in the road
Oh come on now
In the middle of the road, yeah

In the middle of the road you see the darnedest things
Like fat guys driving 'round in jeeps through the city
Wearing big diamond rings and silk suits
Past corrugated tin shacks full up with kids
Oh man I don't mean a Hampstead nursery
When you own a big chunk of the bloody third world
The babies just come with the scenery

Oh come on baby
Get in the road
Oh come on now
In the middle of the road, yeah

The middle of the road is no private cul-de-sac
I can't get from the cab to the curb
Without some little jerk on my back
Don't harass me, can't you tell
I'm going home, I'm tired as hell

I got a kid, I'm thirty-three

Despite distance, time and places, is a fear we can't disguise

Trying to remember, a childhood memory
The echo of the voices, I can hear you calling me

How was I to know so long ago
You would not be here, to pick me up when I'm down
And all before my life is gone I will try to understand
The ending I fear is my own

[chorus]
Will I see you again in the afterlife, in the heavens high above?
Will you remember me in the afterlife, will you show me where to go?
And I'll never understand, until I se you again in the afterlife

Will I see you again in the afterlife, will you recall my name?
You were all that I know and I'm never letting go
You're forever in my heart and in my soul

Can't fight the sadness and regret,
I'll never know how to show you I care
All of the words I meant to say
Now I'l have to tell some other way

Magnitude 9,"[Iron Maiden cover]

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.



",Flight of Icarus,2001
Magnitude 9,"Riding along the wasteland, this barren stretch of earth
We plan the battle of our lives.

We'll march 'til nightfall and scout a place to lie
Our enemy will not expect an attack, behind their lines
Send out the call to the ridings ones, to fall back 'til I give the word
By the sword they'll be dying here the price paid in an act of war

They better run for their lives, or stand and fight
They'll make the sacrifice, forever we roam

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
Knowing an ending is near
Despite of an outcome we fear, no turning back.

What is the cause for outrage, is there more than meets the eye?
Our sanity is displaced, by the choice to fight or die
I hear the cries of the dying ones
As we fight through the bloody war
Our enemies turn and run away,""It's not worth fighting for""

They better run for their lives, or stand and fight
They'll make the sacrifice, forever we roam

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
Knowing an ending is near
Despite of an outcome we fear, no turning back

""But if the cause is good, a heavy burden lies on the King""

[solo]

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
Knowing an ending is near
Despite of an outcome we fear, no turning back.

Out on this barren wasteland, no turning back
The balance of life, lies within our hands
Out of this barren wasteland, no turning back.

Let your memories take you to another time
To a time and place, where nothing's on your mind

To break through the haze and get through the maze
To a level that is real

To finally win this deal

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Time for the Bad Luck Lullaby
You know the one it's the same one you sung
When you wrote down the Revelations
Now sing it over the cradle of the child who's born next
Leave all the truth in so they know what comes next
Leave in the true love that they'll never find
Show how we're looking for it all of our lives
When I saw the Banner hanging over my door
I already knew who the party was for
All of my pain found a partner in that room
And the devil's tail swayed with the tune
Make that Black Record
Roll the tapes all night long
Make that Black Record
And we'll all sing along
Look down the long street
And see who's that crying
Tell them that every day I lived
I was trying to sing the Blues
The way I find them",The Old Black Hen,2003
Magnolia Electric Co.,"Gwendolyn I wonder what you'd've called them
I think a name you might choose is nobody's blues
You see when you are just a kid
They think you won't remember what they did
They think you won't remember, but you did
Then you learned how to say ""everything you love
Tries to get away
Everything you love finally does
""its finally looking good up there our skyline
See how if fits right in there with heaven

The constellations and comiskey's lights
Two old friends in the night
Who always knew they would if they could
Meet one last time in the old neighborhood
Hey wait a minute things ain't looking that good
Its getting quiet and the light's getting dim

And everything you ever looked up to
Now it's all looking down on you

Out of that hole you climbed into
But they're not expecting much
'Cause you got so far down

You got so far down
Well you're right, 'cause I had to take a look around
See the way they're talking

No clues to how you will fare

The candle burns out once more

Torment replaces the feelings the faces somehow

I've come to rest my mind
Help me understand and see what I can find
What's this before me now
What's that behind
It's the prophet of the morning star
He's not so blind
He calls to me so clear
Saying very soon sorrow will be here
But before they pull you down
There's just one chance for you to stay around
Or else a war to end all wars
Sink without a trace
I am the prince of dreams
And you shall know my face
Find the light that shines on everyone
Someone shines the light for me

Seems they will destroy someone's master plan

Looking across the sea
Looking across the land
Wondering what they'll find
Wondering what's at hand
Breathing in the air, feel the falling rain
Getting all prepared for the final day

From out of the crimson air
Suddenly came the fire
Look at the flaming sky
See how the flames grow higher
Alien, your day this not to be
All the people say ?let the world be free?

No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I go beyond your demands
I came to change, you can be sure,
I came to alter the plan

there comes a time when I'm feeling,
There comes a time when it shows
That's when I know I'm believing
When the spirit is one with the soul

I just let go, (I^I^I^I)
Don't you know I just let go, (I I^I^I I I^I)
That's what I'm talking about,

When all we really want to do is:
Let it go

Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong

You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)

Magnus Persson,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place

I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk

Magnus Persson,"Here's to us, one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me, we fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still strivin' for the sky, no taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange when you're down and lyin' on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed with nothin' left untried
Standin' calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

Magnus Uggla,"Där borta vid pilen har jag lagt min far 
En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 

Av den som förstod mig, när jag var till besvär 
Trots all den kärlek fanns jag ej där 

Jag önskar jag stannat, jag skulle blitt kvar 
Den sista stunden, det borde vart jag, och min far 

Han lärde mig växter och dess namn på latin 
Om fideikommiss och Boursin 

Men följde mig gärna in glamrockens land 
Tog del av min kunskap om engelska band 

Allt från John Strummer till Johnny Mars 
Stod på agendan då det var jag, och min far 

Jag saknar hans humor, som var hans sigill  
Den som la grunden för att jag finns till 

Som präglat min uppväxt, ända fram till I dag 
Som gjort att min son är densamma som jag 

Jag får ta del av drömmar han har 
På samma vis som då det var jag, och min far 

Där borta vid pilen, har jag lagt min far 
En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 

Fast jag fann aldrig modet till att säga adjö 
Trodde nog aldrig att du kunde dö

Vi ska enas I jorden jag, och min far

Y cuando llegue el final
El otoño de nuestro amor
Yo te esperaré, mientras, vive
Y lucha por tener

Derecho a elegir
Con qué cabeza tu almohada compartir
Orgulloso de ser quien eres

Cuánto sonreír

Se puede transformar

Mi piedra filosofal

Y conseguí llegar frente al guardián de luz 
No quiso dejarme entrar 
Condenado a deambular por la inmensa oscuridad
Sólo no podré escapar

Me rompe el corazón 
Y mi alma en poder de otro dios está
No, no quiso dejarme entrar

Creo en la amistad que no pide edad 
Creo en el amor, sin condición 
Creo en la humildad del que sabe ganar 
Creo en el honor sin uniforme ni Dios 

No creo en un altar que salve mi fe 
Ser honesto es mejor que un cielo lleno de himnos 
No creo en un líder que dirija mis pies 
mi rey es mi voluntad, mi patria mi hogar 

Sé que existe un lugar más allá entre las estrellas 
Donde nacen los versos que yo nunca pude encontrar 
Donde el alma de a luz y al parirte te nazcan besos 
con labios de esperanza yo creo en ti, creo en mí 

Oh

Sé que existe un lugar más allá entre las estrellas 
Dónde nacen los versos que yo nunca pude encontrar 
Donde el alma de a luz y al parirte te nazcan besos 
con labios de esperanza yo creo en ti, creo en mí 

Sé que existe un lugar donde hallar un beso perdido 
Donde nacen los sueños y llaman una oportunidad 
Donde hacerte el amor sea morir dentro de tu cuerpo 
Creo en una caricia, creo que existe ese lugar 

Creo en la pasión, ella es mi voz 
Creo que al final te encontraré","Creo (La Voz de Dormida, Pt. 2)",2005
Mägo de Oz,"Ahora que esta todo en silencio
Y que la calma me besa el corazón
Os quiero decir adiós
Porque a llegado la hora de que andeis el camino ya sin mi
Hay tanto por lo que vivir
No llores cielo y vuélvete a enamorar
Me gustaría volver a verte sonreír
Pero mi vida yo nunca podre olvidarte 
Y solo el viento sabe lo que as sufrido por amarme

Hay tantas cosas que nunca te dije en vida 
Que eres todo cuanto amo 
Y ahora que ya no estoy junto a ti te cuidare desde aquí 
Se que la culpa os acosa y os susurra al oído 
""pude hacer mas"", no ahi nada que reprochar
Ya no ahí demonios en el fondo del cristal 
Y solo bebo todos los besos que no te di
Pero mi vida yo nunca podre olvidarte 
Y solo el viento sabe lo que has sufrido por amarme
Ahí tantas cosas que nunca te dije en vida
Que eres todo cuanto amo y ahora que no estoy junto a ti
Vivo cada vez que habláis de mi y muero otra vez si lloráis
He aprendido al fin a disfrutar y soy feliz

No llores cielo y vuélvete a enamorar
Nunca me olvides me tengo que marchar
Pero mi vida yo nunca podre olvidarte 
Y solo el viento sabe lo que has sufrido por amarme
Hay tantas coas que nunca te dije en vida
Que eres todo cuanto amo y ahora que ya no estoy junto a ti
Desde mi cielo os arropare en la noche 
Y os acunare en los sueños y espantare todos los miedos
Desde mi cielo os esperare escribiendo
No estoy solo pues me cuidan la liberta y la esperanza
Yo nunca os olvidare",Desde Mi Cielo,2005
Mägo de Oz,"Duermo en un acorde mágico
Y despierto al oírlo tocar
Soy la esencia de la humanidad

Represento la promiscuidad 
De las almas que enferman de paz
Me presento: soy la libertad 
De tu cuerpo y no cobro con fe! 

Y ahora dime: ¿cuánto vale tu alma? 
Y ahora pide: ¿dinero o placer? 
¿sueñas con curar el cáncer? 
El sida. fue cosa de yahvé

Quiero estar junto a ti y alimentar tu boca
Hay veces que el dolor, duerme en una canción
Y sé que moriré de amor decadente
Lúgubres besos ¡quémate en mí! 

El príncipe de la dulce pena soy 
Y mi sangre alimenta tu ser
La lujuria de mis alas 
Roza tus pechos y araña tu piel

Bebe! embriaga tus vicios
Decide! orgasmos o amor
La única iglesia que ilumina es la que arde
El nazareno duerme en su cruz

Quiero estar junto a ti y alimentar tu boca
Hay veces que el dolor, duerme en una canción
Y sé que moriré de amor decadente
Lúgubres besos ¡quémate en mí! 

“oh señor, rey de la tristeza
Ángel del dulce dolor
Bebe la hiel de mi boca
Blasfema, ven, hazme el amor”

Quiero estar junto a ti y alimentar tu boca
Hay veces que el dolor, duerme en una canción
Y sé que moriré de amor decadente
Lúgubres besos ¡quémate en mí!

Mägo de Oz,"Si me ves, bésame 
Hazme un sitio entre tu piel

Voy buscando alguna voz en mí 
Que me ayude bien a discernir
Pues mi mente es un vestido que me queda mal
¿Cual ha sido, dónde está el error? 
¿Quién me ha condenado al terror 
De una mente en blanco y negro? 

¿Dónde está mi lugar? 
No soy como los demás
Yo sé pensar!
Estoy sólo y tengo miedo

Si me ves, bésame
Hazme un sitio entre tu piel
Que los rasgos de mi cara 
No te impidan ver mi ser

Sentirás que mi amor 
Tiene sed de que una voz 
Me susurre una caricia 
O me regale una ilusión

Dame mimos, dame tu calor
Te los devolveré en forma de flor
Recibirás por cien, multiplicado lo que me des

Si me apartas, no me integraré
Si me abandonas, yo me perderé
El rechazo es mi condena

¿Dónde está, mi libertad? 
Buscaré un futuro para mí
Me va a costar!
Pero sin amor no puedo

Si me ves, bésame
Hazme un sitio entre tu piel
Que los rasgos de mi cara
No te impidan ver mi ser

Sentirás que mi amor 
Tiene sed de que una voz 
Me susurre una caricia 
O me regale una ilusión

Y al final llegaré 
Donde me lleven los pies
Y si quieres conocerme
No me observes, mírame

¿Dónde estás, Libertad? 
Mi celda es la soledad
El silencio que no calla 
Es el vacío de tu voz

Mägo de Oz,"Cuando un sueño se te muera 
O entre en coma una ilusión
No lo entierres ni lo llores, resucítalo 

Y jamás des por perdida 
La partida, cree en ti
Y aunque duelan, las heridas curarán

Hoy el día ha venido a buscarte 
Y la vida huele a besos de jazmín
La mañana esta recién bañada
El sol la ha traído a invitarte a vivir

Y verás que tú puedes volar
Y que todo lo consigues
Y verás que no existe el dolor
Hoy te toca ser feliz

Si las lágrimas te nublan 
La vista y el corazón
Haz un trasvase de agua 
Al miedo, escúpelo

Y si crees que en el olvido 
Se anestesia un mal de amor
No hay peor remedio 
Que la soledad

Deja entrar en tu alma una brisa 
Que avente las dudas y alivie tu mal
Que la pena se muera de risa
Cuando un sueño se muere 
Es porque se ha hecho real

Y verás que tú puedes volar 
Y que todo lo consigues
Y verás que no existe el dolor
Hoy te toca ser feliz

Las estrellas en el cielo 
Son solo migas de pan 
Que nos dejan nuestros sueños 
Para encontrar 
El camino, y no perdernos 
Hacia la tierra de oz

Y que tu cuerpo es el viento
Porque hoy tú vas a sonreír
Hoy te toca ser feliz",Hoy Toca Ser Feliz,2005
Mägo de Oz,"Se despertó a medianoche a mirar 
Si el reflejo del agua podía encontrar 
Aquella risa que un día mudó 
Y, por segunda piel, de soledad se vistió

Buscó respuesta en el aire
Mientras el mar le arropó
Pidió ayuda a su estrella
Que le abandonó
Pues olvidó llorar

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena
Es llover tristeza para poder ser feliz

Cierra los ojos, abre el corazón
Y aprende a ver con los ojos del alma ella oyó 
Le hablaba el viento, le hablaba una flor
Con la cadencia que tiene un susurro de amor 

Deja salir los fantasmas 
Que amargan besos y dan
A cambio de tus silencios
Acopio de ansiedad
Mutilada paz

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena
Es llover tristeza para poder ser feliz

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena
¡escucha, soy gaia! 
¡no castres tu rabia! 
¡que tu alma escupa el dolor! 

Que llueva tristeza al llorar
Y que sacie la amargura su sed
Las lágrimas son el jabón 
Que limpia de penas tu piel

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti

Un Dios que esté en la tierra
En los valles, los ríos 
Un Dios que viva en la lluvia 
Que viaje a traves del viento 
Y acaricie nuestra alama 

Un Dios de los tristes, de los homosexuales
Un Dios más humano 
Un Dios que no castigue, que enseñe 
Un Dios que no amenace,que proteja
Que si me caigo, me levante
Que si me pierdo, me tienda su mano 
Un Dios que si erro, no me culpe 
Y que si dudo, me entienda 
Pues para eso me dotó de inteligencia 
Para dudar de todo

Si quieres rock, si buscas rock 
Mi nombre es rock’n’roll 
Y cuando muera que se lea en mi tumba 
Mi nombre es rock’n’roll 

Nunca creí en la biblia, ¡no! 
Ni en la torá ni el corán 
Mi fe en un libro no cabe, es mucho más 
Está hecha de libertad 

Viviré, viajaré, moriré, vestiré 
Sin traje ni corbata que me ate a su ley 

El viento peina mis recuerdos 
Barre los malos momentos 
La velocidad me aleja de mí 

¡nos siguen los maderos!

Pisa y ponla a cien

Mägo de Oz,"Hay miedos que se acurrucan 
Entre uno y otro escalón 
De la escalera que sube 
De tus sueños hacia el sol 

Y te acechan y no dejan 
Que tú elijas tu lugar 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Hay dudas que nos mutilan 
Hay deudas del corazón 
Hay días que nos estorban 
Hay “dioses” que van de dios 

Pero hay voces que no callan 
Si las sabes escuchar 
Son los gritos de tu gente 
Que te animan a luchar 

Y verás que en la vida hay que sufrir 
Y verás que en la vida hay que luchar 
Y al final si eres fuerte ganarás 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Ten cerca siempre a un amigo 
Y al enemigo a tu par 
Para aprender como piensa 
Y cuando actue reaccionar 

Las traiciones que bien matan 
Son las hechas con amor 
Y no hay estocada más grande 
Que el acero de una voz 

Y verás que en la vida hay que sufrir 
Y verás que en la vida hay que luchar 
Y al final si eres fuerte ganarás 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Y el sudor de tu frente saciará 
Tu sed de tener sueños y vivir 
Y la vida será tu mayor rival 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Hay miedos que se acurrucan 
Si les cobija tu voz",No Queda Sino Batirnos,2007
Mägo de Oz,"Hace algún tiempo que yo naufragué 
Entre la playa de su juventud 
A la deriva se me hundió un amor 
Y mi vida se encalló 

Hace ya tiempo que emborraché 
Todos los versos que un día canté 
Con el aliento que da una mujer 
Que ya no volverá 

Hice inventario de lo que perdí 
Eché las cuentas de lo que invertí 
Años de lucha, noches sin dormir 
Y ahora soy músico y te tengo a ti 

Quiero cantar quiero gritar 
Quiero vivir en libertad 
Quiero morir cerca de ti 
Quiero encontrar lo que perdí 

Por las esquinas de alguna canción 
Vende su alma a veces la ilusión 
Pero jamás la mía venderé 
Rockero moriré 

Abrigo derrotas y les doy calor 
Con una rima que cosí a mi voz 
Maquillo nostalgias y les doy color 
Con pentagramas que pinté 

Quiero cantar quiero gritar 
Quiero vivir en libertad 
Quiero morir cerca de ti 
Quiero encontrar lo que perdí 

Quiero cantar quiero gritar 
Para que entiendas que yo fui 
Solo un juglar que se escondió 
Entre canciones y una voz",El Rincón de Los Sentidos,2007
Mägo de Oz,"Suelo imaginarme 
Cuando lo quiero dejar 
Que existe un mundo escondido 
Donde van a parar 

Cada lágrima que lloré por ti 
Y todo el veneno que inoculaste en mí 
Sus ríos son canciones que deje a deber 
Son desagües de mi ayer 

Seguiré caminando por la vida 
Sin volver la vista atrás 
Nunca dejé una partida 
Lucho siempre hasta el final 

Es el foro de la envidia 
Vertederos de opinión 
Donde se almacenan odios 
Cárcel de una canción 

Venderme es hacerte caso 
En vez de a mi corazón 
Y si es tan fácil, hazlo tú 

Seguiré caminando por la vida 
Sin volver la vista atrás 
Nunca deje una partida 
Lucho siempre hasta el final 

Viviré peleando con la vida 
Venderé cara mi piel 
Sin lamerme las heridas 
Y si molesto me quedo y que os den! 

Al menos tengo tu odio 
Tengo tu rencor 
Y si yo me pudro 
Te envenenará mi olor","Si Molesto, Me Quedo",2007
Mägo de Oz,"Desde que no estás 
El escenario duerme 
Sólo con tu voz despertará 

Si pudieras ver 
Lo mucho que me faltas 
Mi guitarra se ha muerto de pie 

Cada noche es un acto de amor 
Y el concierto se hace una cama 
Pero faltas tú, tu respiración 
Es la nana que me calma 

Sin ti sería silencio 
Sin ti se muere mi voz 
Sin ti tiritan de frío 
Los sueños de cada canción 

Porque si no estás 
Quien me va a curar 
De mi soledad 
Porque sin tu voz 
No me curaré, hoy quiero cantar 

Desde que no estás 
Los minutos se hacen horas 
La derrota silba una canción 

Dime dónde estás 
Necesito que tus manos 
Maten mis miedos al aplaudir 

Cada noche yo te imagino aquí 
Regalándome tu mirada 
Abrazándome con brazos de luz 
Tu sonrisa era mi almohada 

Dile a las estrellas 
Ahora que eres eternidad 
Que te busque un buen sitio 
Una buena localidad 

Necesito oírte 
Necesito que tu voz 
Nunca se borre de mi ser 

Sin ti sería silencio 
Sin ti se muere mi voz 
Sin ti tiritan de frío 
Los sueños de cada canción 

Porque si no estás 
Quien me va a curar 
De mi soledad 
Porque sin tu voz 
No podré escuchar a un ángel cantar","Sin Ti Sería Silencio, Pt. 2",2007
Mägo de Oz,"Ya no siento el amor 
No me sirve de nada 
Si me niegas tus besos 
No tengo tu boca 
Y se me parte el alma

Siempre confie en ti 
Ahora me siento solo 
Me dejaste tirado 
Tu acto, tu ausencia 
Y te fuiste con otro

Con los gatos me muevo 
Por todos los tejados 
Rogando a las estrellaz 
Pidiendo a la luna 
Que vuelvas a mi lado 

Y ahora voy a salir 
A beber en los bares 
Para olvidarme de ti 
Y volver a vivir 
Y pasarlo bien padre

Maldita sea mi suerte 
Mira que tonto e sido 
Me undo en mis recuerdos 
Como me arrepiento 
De haberte conocido 

Me busque a los colegas 
Los tenia olvidados 
Me apartaste de ellos 
Maldita pendeja 
Jamás me han fallado

Y ahora voy a salir 
A beber en los bares 
Para olvidarme de ti 
Y volver a vivir 
Y pasarla bien padre

Que me entierren aquí 
Envueltito en frijoles 
Entre aztecas y mayas 
Que viva la raza 
Viva mexico

Padre nuestro, de todos nosotros

De los marginados y de los desprotegidos 
De los desheredados y de los dueños de la miseria 
De los que te siguen y de los que en ti, ya no creemos

Baja de tu trono 
Pues aquí hay guerras, hambre, injusticias

¿La Banca? ¿La Alta Política? 
Nuestro reino es Nigeria, Etiopía, Colombia, Hiroshima 
El pan nuestro de cada día son las violaciones 
La violencia de género 
La pederastia, las dictaduras
El cambio climático
En la tentación caigo a diario 
No hay mañana en la que no esté tentado de crear un Dios humilde, justo
Un Dios que esté en la tierra
En los valles, los ríos 
Un Dios que viva en la lluvia 
Que viaje a traves del viento 
Y acaricie nuestra alama 

Un Dios de los tristes, de los homosexuales
Un Dios más humano 
Un Dios que no castigue, que enseñe 
Un Dios que no amenace,que proteja
Que si me caigo, me levante
Que si me pierdo, me tienda su mano 
Un Dios que si erro, no me culpe 
Y que si dudo, me entienda 
Pues para eso me dotó de inteligencia 
Para dudar de todo

Hay veces que no se 
Si exprimir el sol 
Para sentir calor 

Durante miles de años, los seres humanos 
Hemos podido disfrutar, del mejor regalo 
Que los dioses dieran jamás a ningún ser vivo 

La brisa, el viento, el hermano sol y la hermana luna 
Campos y praderas donde ver crecer a nuestros hijos 
Amaneceres bañados con el perfume que estornudan las flores en primavera 
Puestas de sol decoradas por los sueños aun por concebir 
Y aunque parezca mentira inteligencia 

Pero el hombre blanco despreció aquel tesoro 
Y a medida que la vida le sonreía
El le contestaba dando patadas al destino 

Si alguien lee esta carta, no olvide que el fin de esta civilización 
Se debió al egoísmo, codicia e incultura de la raza humana 

Los hombres ya no somos mamíferos 
El ser humano no se convirtió en depredador 
La raza humana somos simplemente un virus 
Matamos, crecemos, y nos multiplicamos 

Por eso nos extinguimos 
Por eso las aguas se tragaron nuestra civilización 
La verdadera atlántida, éramos nosotros 

Y por eso hemos escrito esta nota 
Para formas de vida inteligente venideras
Cuando los hombres escupen al suelo
Se escupen a si mismos",Atlantia,2010
