Teddy Zig Zag,"Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart",Hungry Heart,2003

You know some people got no joys
So just go with your inner voice
You get down and I'll bring the noise

You have kept out what's important
How's it feel to be all alone?
 
I don't want to tell you
That I've heard it all before
'Cause I've been taking
More than I've been giving
 
And underneath my shadow
There's so much that lies in store
Simple things
Make life worth living
 
[Chorus: x2]
 
I don't claim to know the answers
I just know I could do much more
No excuses anymore
 
Now I've opened up my window
Hear the children on the street
Love has stolen all the bitterness
And sent it off with the breeze

Now I don't want to tell you
That I've heard it all before
'Cause I've been taking
More than I've been giving
 
And underneath my shadow
There's so much that lies in store
Simple things
Make it all worth living

Venti pile vuote le riverso sopra il blocco note

Pago l’affitto per me e per mia madre

Li lascio affogare mentre prendo il volo
E divento un puntino lontano nel cielo che stanno a guardare
Nei messaggi privati lei mi chiama “Papi”

When it's beef, they'll come and kill everything movin'
I'll never tell you what I think

Laugh, cry with him, for cuz
His loyalty ain't where I need it at

Had a heart attack, died in his bed, they thought he was sleep

Then I just take and make it mine

I think about how sweet it is to be me

Well if you gon keep playin round
You gon have to figure out

Glipse I'm callin
When I'm stalling
If I'm callin for you, you, you, you
What else can you do?
Caution your heart

But I keep a loud tool 
Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool 
Got stock like Dow do
 
New hardtop 
Off the car lot 
Hit the gas tires smoke like cigar shops 
Make ya jaw drop 
Bought it off the narc cops 
Tax on the work we got them H and R blocks 
Alumni yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks 
Looking out for the twelve Roger Staubach 
No cafe but we had them hard rocks 
For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks 
So before ya heart stop 
Or the narcs knock 
I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot 
Cuz the streets don't play fair 
Niggas mad cuz you got more rides than the state fair

Or rather show you how to boat 
And hope that you can live or float 
Independently self made 
And well paid 
Three whips one chain no welt pain 
When you treeing over niggas they gon yell shade 
They outta patience where I live cuz they sell weight 
Avoided the temptation of crack slinging 
But Lincoln park had it looking like back in the eighties 
Now partners getting broads and the hottest whips 
And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship 
Ain't have a pot to piss 
I wasn't born rich 
When I be writing I'm as hungry as a model bitch 
She got the fattest ass they got the hottest look 
Leaving wit eight bitches I need some octopus 
See how wale go j four cs 
My lake shore whore never be on the bs 
Bullshit chi town 
Riding around 
Top down 
Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around 
What it do 
Penny phones all blue 
Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool 
Yellow lam g shit 
She double od shit 
Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching

Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass 
But got lost when me and the cash crossed paths 
Indo smoke out my nose no mustache

Fuck is you drunk? 
Pay that up front 
Like the Ferrari trunk 
Be careful you won't 
Have to be sorry hon 
Stay close to the G's and you might learn sum'n 
Might earn sum'n 
Chop it up like mobsters on the rooftop let you burn sum'n 
Stop talking so much 
Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say

Backwoods in my ashtray

Lately been writing poems
Can't put my soul in the bullshit
Music that ya condone you fuck it
I'ma count all these duckets
I'ma keep my integrity
Ya can keep all yall budgets
Buzz it like my very first day in here
Laying here, laying here all in your lady ear

I'm past present you light years
Behind here 

Rolling while I'm blowing in this stash
Got my foot on the gas
Drop top on this thang
And the moon looking beautiful as ever
See these lights got me on another level
Feeling like tonight
Were running wild tonight
They can never hold me down
'Cause I'm running gone
Uh, uh yeah they Larry Davis me
And try say I killed a cop
Picture that and they ain't fire
Not a single shot they said I'm guilty
N I ain't get the chance to say I'm not
Bail was a quarter mill
They put me in a box, ha
Dead broke tryna get a bail
Calling niggas really knowing
They don't give a hell

But I ain't give a fuck
Cus I ain't trying sit in jail
They giving niggas letters here
And they ain't sending mail
Im talking life sentence
Forever night ?
This shit right here
Turn a man to a mice, nigga
This shit right here
Turn a killer to a nice nigga
Cold cell, lock down like a vice gripper
Lead by my strategy
Winning I do sporadically try attacking me
Automatic shoot automatically
City backing me headed for it
No looking back at me
Lyrical assault they charge me
Without the battery, ha
Running rebel on another level
Like the Olympics these youngins
Just won another metal
They say to get a hundred mill
U must become the devil if u believe that
Nigga u is dumb as ever
Young and dumb or even old and stupid
I put my faith in God
Never try I just do it

TeeFLii,"I got a feelin nigga wit it ? and my money be da root.
Look up at da stars, she like ""Honey where da roof?""
Pull up in a Dawes ?, canaries ? dey go on roof,
Even once had a job pourin tar up on da roof.
Dat boy had it hard, no fasad it's da truth,
So now when I menage and get massaged it's da proof.
Proof's in da pudding and dat bakin soda taken,
Paper dat I'm makin, gotta take dem photos naked.
Listenin to niggas like whistlin dat Wendy Williams,
I flip my middle finga, I'm chillin on twenty million.
Da rumors turn me on I'm masterbatin at da top,
These hoes so excited so dey catchin every drop.
I'm dodgin debacles like pot holes in Jamaica,
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on dem acres.
Martin had a dream, Bob got high,
I still do both but somehow I got by.

Creflo prayed, Mike Vick payed,
Bobby Brown strayed, Whitney lost weight.
Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write,
Dat may why the money lookin funny in the light.
But who really cares? You just throw it in the air,
Celebratin wealth, pourin Mo«t in her hair-
Excuse me, her weeve- the bluest of weed,
Trunk full of white, car smell like bleu cheese.
Dat boy get salad ?, beef bout movements,
BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin foolish.
Shawty sittin low, big thangs poppin,
Tip on da glock from a trip up in Compton.
Shootin at da cops- fuck one time.
I gave her to da block, I fucked one time.
We boys in da hood and nigga you Lil' Trey,
Suppress ya appetite, we takin ya lil' tray.
Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit,
Banned in 1994 but I'm too legit to quit.
1996, kilos was the shit,
But dat were better den roofin dat shit be bad for ya skin.
Niggas was ruthless, lord knows dat I sinned,
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin.
Walked out on a gig and I turned to da streets,
Kept my name low key, I ain't heard from in weeks.
I came up with a strategy to come up mathematically,
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me.
Mothafuck em all, they sweat from my balls,
If I drop anotha album I did dat fo my dawgs.
10 Maybachs, everybody ridin big,
I just sit back like: Look what I did.
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness,
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business.

Smokin on a blunt in my own restaurant,
People lookin from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Kunk,
Reincarnated, spirit of a G.
Beef? I'll make you dinner, take a seat so we could eat.
A Farrakhan aura, paws on the Port,
You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork.
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in dey coil,
I'm laughin at you 'cause, kill you niggas when I'm bored.

We steppin on ya crew til the mothafuckas crushed,
And makin sweet love to every women dat ya lust.
I love to pay her bills, can't wait to pay her rent,
Curtis Jackson baby mama ain't askin for a cent.
Burn the house down, we gotta buy another,
Don't forget the gas can, jealous, stupid muthafucka.
To anotha chapter, paper dat I captured,
Caught up in da rapture of gunshots and laughter.
Homicide is human and nigga you lookin funny,
Women love to stare cause dey know dey see da money.
I open up a mind by openin bank accounts,
Deposit a 100 stacks, break up or take it out.
Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live,
I knew it wouldn't work, but I just like to give.
Used to run da street- young nigga, bare feet,
Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin crab meats.
Ice so right, otha rappers envy,
Dey callin all my jewelers up askin wat he spendin.
Thinkin bout Boss, not thinkin bout dem,
This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send.",Deep,2014

TeeFLii,"Now I’m in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
every night in front of a new crowd
That’s new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I cant, no, I won`t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now (ow, ow)

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I’m like glue, I stick to other artists
I’m not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you (at all)

You need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you (at all)
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don’t need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer you’re just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit’s cool
I will blast and I didn’t go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe

And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, (at all)
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I’ll be aiming it right
I won’t stop till my name’s in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I’m on Arabian Nights
Because I’m young and all my brother’s gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The game’s over but now I’m on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I’m bound to blow up
I’ve done around about a thousand shows
But I haven’t got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I’m singing them out
(Wow)
From day one, I’ve been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I’m back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
‘Cause it’s another day
Plus I’ll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD’s from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD’s from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I’m still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I’m still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I’m always doing shows if I’m not I’m in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I’m up and coming like I’m fucking in an elevator.

Of your father's power trip
All your bruises fit his grip

It's a crime
But you think that it's all your fault
'Cause it happens all the time

""You're an idiot"", ""Be a man""
Now you wanna shut his mouth
Feel the shotgun in your hand

Transmission incoming from higher command
What are my orders today
You want me to eat from a garbage can
Yes sir, I hear and obey

I've been on this mission all my life
For zero pay, but that's O.K.

The voice in my head controls me
It keeps me from feeling lonely
The voice in my head controls me
A mission for me and me only
One agent alone in your nation
My specialty's infiltration
They're coming to capture and hold me
The voice in my head just told me

Undercover in a land of enemy spies
I live disguised as a bum
Primary target, discovering lies
What will their purpose become

Teen Idols,"Lets analyze the state of things 
And count the ways 
You bring me down 
Brand new people leave us feelin' better 
So happy now we're not together 

I heard your back in town 
Hope I don't see you around 
Wearin' the loser crown and 

When I think of things we used to say 
I laugh out loud 
Funny times from yesterday 
People say 'you were great, 
It's too bad it had to end that way' 
But they don't know what you're all about 

Your legacy won't fade away 
Just like a rotten smell 
That's stale and sour 
Your open window let some air in 
And it's bound to get 
Better by the hour 

When I say 
It's all okay 
You just turn around and walk away 
'cause you know it deep inside 
That you never meant a thing 
As I lift my head up to sing 
And just walk away",The Longest Walk,2003

So you're blue
but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face

Ah, but girl you're only a child

But you seem pretty young

Teen Trio,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Searching in the darkness for a piece of me

I can feel this for sure
I've been here before
I can fell this for sure for sure

In a island by the sea
With rainbow coloured people

But where is the sincerity
I, I guess that with our love that too has flown

'Cause lately we can't even touch each other
Without acting just like distant lovers
We've even took to fighting under covers
What a shame, baby, who's to blame
Young love
Why you want to grow old on me now
Young love
Why you want to grow old on me now
Don't say goodbye my love, no, no, no, baby
Just one more try, young love

Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared
Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared (When love was new, baby)
Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared (And we were to sugar)
Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared (Listen to me)

Don't you think we ought to give it one more try
We've come too far to be saying goodbye
Give it on more try
Ooh, don't you remember, baby
Young love was much better
Ooh, my love

Why you want to grow old on me
Why you want to keep me in misery
Why you want to say goodbye
Why you want to make me cry, baby
Young love, my love, your love
Why you want to say goodbye
Why you want to make me cry, baby

I'm cryin', baby
I'm cryin', baby
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love
Don't say goodbye

Teena Marie,"Hey you, back there!
Crying out in dark despair
Your spark-long gone
Did it vanish like the light of dawn

You lied-you tried
Playing it off like it don't hurt you
You used to be so full of fire
Now all that's left is lonely desire

Lonely desire-who put out your fire
Lonely desire-who put out your fire

Why do-you do
All the things that you despise
Your ways so crazed
I could have told you they were born to die

Your heart bleeds-weak knees
Playing it off is so hard to do
You used to be so full of fire
Now all that's left is lonely desire

Lonely desire-who put out your fire
Lonely desire-who put out your fire

I saw you
You ought to think about it
You ought to let me get close to you

Let me start your fire

So if you hear me cry, just know that I
I want to be touched
I need to be loved
I long to be touched and loved by too, too many colors

Teena, what would the world be like if everyone saw with their hearts
Instead of their eyes?
Well, I guess it would be like your smile, Maya - innocent and pure

I've never felt in love before
You got the nicest smile, and when I hear you speak
I go crazy; I'm so weak

Why did I have to fall in love with you?
Why did I have to fall in love with you?
Oh, I've got a real good lovin' for you, baby

Some say you're just a picture on my wall

So we got up, walked out, went to your place
There's no confusing the smile on my face
It's not an easy thing to run away from

If I listen to my mama - she say
You're just a young girl, and you can't feel this way

If I listen to my daddy

We walked into your room, and you shut the door
I've never been in this position before
I think I bit off more than I could chew
I can't be here with you
I'm just a young girl in love

I tried to say, but my lips wouldn't move
There's no prevention when it comes to you

You're heaven's dial, a crush
I prayed for you forever
And he sent you last November, finally

You better hold tight flight
Two shadows, one at night

The spirit in this very song, reminding me
That life has taught me lessons
Like don't dare to question fate
For God will do the gifting
All we've got to do is wait

So if anybody asks you if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to 365

365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear

I got a love jones in my bones
I hear a saxaphone
A melody so haunting
It leaves my heart never wanting
More than you
You really fit the bill

The first day of April
And now I know that deep inside my heart
You're gonna play the biggest part in my love debut
For with you comes the passion
Like Spring time I fathom grand
I cherish every blessing I get
When you kiss and hold my hand

So if anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five

That's when I met you
When Heaven sent you baby, ah
Sometimes I stop and throw my hands up in the air
You make me holler, hey
Tee, Tee won't go away

It's more than just a feeling, it's destiny
I'm gonna testify about the long you're giving to me
I'm gonna break it down for you

He's kinny garden
I in knee socks
He goin' play doctor over by the docks

I was three years too old for them to ignore
She said I was robbin' the cradle
But it was Cradle Rob and me

And we'll have none of that""

I told my best friend name, Mickey, girl
We're really living in a sicky world
We need a whole new constitution

A revolution, a revolution won't do

Sipping Saki to their heart's content, oh no
Go tell his friend the Mahareshi, sheesh

Reading captions from the Catcher in the Rye
It didn't take too many dollars, no
To get his hands on a revolver, blow
We need a whole new constitution
'Cause any old revolution won't do

Pepperland, there must be a toe jam working
Joo joo on his brain
If not then why do I feel so all alone
I saw a thousand different candles die
Dakota station, we've been scandaled, why
We need a whole new constitution

The situation's gotten too far out of hand
We need a whole new constitution

And here I am, huh
Getting ready to get on this train
And I don't have anybody to talk to
But myself
You can't even hear me
And my words cannot convey my feeling

Manchester, England looks a lot like me today
Ain't no sunshine in the feelin'

Ain't no truth in the believing

It's the natural thing to think of you
After all we've been through
Do you ever think of me at night
Wondering why I left your world undone

So very far from you (Far from lovin' you)
Ooh, baby, did I warn ya (Baby, did I warn ya)
I'd take your love to Liverpool (Where's California)

Planted in love by a being far beyond this
What can it be?
Such a sweet yet painful feeling,
Came over me?

[Chorus:]
Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes indeed.

I am the bird which cannot be caged completely,
Even though I long to spread my wings so bittersweetly.
What will I do ?
Shall I hold my love in silence
Wonder if you feel it too.

[Chorus]

I've heard it said that all is fair in love and war,
But tell it like it is, does the distance hide the scar
Living our lives all alone, changing,
Never really knowing what games we're playing (oh baby)
Laughing when we should have both been praying 
(Living, I'm living a lie)

You are the rush and the flow of every river,
Soft as the touch of love when you want to be the giver.
How do I know 
I guess I just imagined
Painfully so

(Midnight magnet) 
You gave me kisses so unreal
(Midnight magnet)
You blew my mind, so what's the deal
(Midnight magnet)
I'm talkin' 'bout the way I feel
(Midnight magnet)

River eyes, I crossed the state line nearing down
Thinkin' 'bout the times the magnet turned me on
I closed my eyes one instant right on junction east
I used to be the beauty, now I am the beast
The comedy of errors took me to the cliffs
The pedal to the medal, now my gears won't shift
The last thing I remember was my mama's call
I woke up three weeks later in the hospital

No circumspect
I won't forget
No light as yet

How can you run from a dream living inside me
I say I care, it isn't fair, what's gonna be
I wanted you to love me, love me, love me
Like I loved you, loved you, loved you, loved you, oh

I thought you said you loved me

You gave me kisses so unreal
You were the magnet and I was the steel
Call it what you want to, but you know it was the magnet
Call it what you want to, but you know that it was wrong

Teena Marie,"Standing on the corner of rhythm and blues
A Valentino smile gave me my first clue
Tell me girl, I wonder can you spare me some time
He said, I mean more than just your nine to five

Love at first sight I thought so

That led me to his passion
It was not ""pillow talk""

Sunrise talks just to you
Nocturnal night one last adieu
I'm coming, I'm going
I'm swimming, I'm flowing
I'm right here beside you babe
Passion was not the answer
Was not the question

Yet it was all of this and more
Your river and heartlight
The ebb in the tide at night
The do, in the do me babe
I'm dreaming of, the one I love
I fall into a slumber deep
In eyes as black as ebony
And if there ever was a spark
It's when we're shadow boxing in the dark

Seems like I was crying all night long
Me baby gone away and left me blue
And there's not a lot that me can do
No there's not a lot that me can do

Foolish pride to think that I could just forget it
Knowing that the need would still be here
Lonely, lonely room, I hold my pillow close to me
Just an empty bed of memories

It's turning, it's turning baby, much too fast

So political the situations, really
Crazy like a you know what I mean

Teena Marie,"Photographic memories
Scanners of our love affair
Like we were the L.A. Times
The headlines read ""Beware""
I don't deal in hearsay
Calculation ain't my game
But today I see you
And I hang my head in shame

Lipstick on your collar, and the colour isn't mine
White lines on the dresser, and you even drank my wine
Babe your face is flushed
It's more than just a hunch
Tell me what's this fear
Maybe she's still here
Baby you're an alibi
You cross your heart and hope to die
Promising to tell no lies
Baby you're an alibi

Looking out the window
I can hear the engine roar
Cobalt Blue Pantera
Dashes through the garage door
Now you cry injustice and synthetic violins
Every night outside my door
A candle in the wind

Lipstick on your collar, and the color isn't mine
White lines on the dresser, and you even drank my wine
Babe your face is flushed
It's more than just a hunch
Tell me what's this fear
Maybe the picture's clear
Baby you're an alibi
You cross your heart and hope to die
Promising to tell no lies
Baby you're an alibi
Babe your face is flushed
It's more than just a hunch
Tell me what's this fear
Maybe the picture's clear

I flash back to another time zone
When you were late most every night
I was a prisoner by my own device

You crossed your heart and hoped to die",Alibi,1984
Teena Marie,"Two weeks ago last Sunday, I was on my way from church
I met a guy named Youngblood, who was totally berserk
He told me he was looking for a place to lay his head
I read him Romans 8:14 and this is what he said

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's go, I got plenty of blow, and it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me lover, 'cause I got the gift of gab and a few other specialties
I'd really like to make you, if you'd only let me date you
You'd belong only to me
He said I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out, and oh
He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party

I can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind
Knowing there was no contentment in two eyes so blind
I told him that the joy would surely bring eternal bliss
I read Galatians Chapter 4, and he said yea check this

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, get live, it's a much hipper vibe
And it's more fun doing wrong
The ladies call me baby 'cause I've got a killer smile
And they love my smooth touch
Only time will tell, if there's Heaven or Hell
Or if I'm just out to lunch
He said I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out, and oh
He asked me to help Youngblood get to the freaky party
But I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party

Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's ride, it's a long way to slide and it's more fun doing wrong
And the ladies call you lover 'cause you got a killer smile and they love your smooth touch
But all that you have done, you can tell to the one
Who has given you so much",Help Youngblood Get to the Freaky Party,1984

When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips

Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby

Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this

Under your spell, what is it, what is it

Then you crooned a song to me on your guitar

Hush my broken heart, this must be paradise

Trying to find the treasure and it's just beyond the light

Go with the flow
How many beats per measure will determine where we go

We don't need no Mercedes
We don't need no Cadillac
We don't need no Harley baby
To put us on the right track

Though I know my world may change
It's all in fun and games
And I know adventure is just the way to live
I've got to let the gypsy dance
Forget about the past
One answer to the question asked
What's at the end of the rainbow?

At the end of every rainbow there's a pot of that 14 k
Golden lovely shine for me today
Everybody get up
It's beautiful today

Well I've been talking to the moon
Conversation
Kismet but it always ends too soon
Tripping
Perhaps by choice
I like to feel the magic
Can't you hear it in my voice

We don't need no steam roller
We don't even need a jet
We don't need no rapid transit
To show us where it's at

[Chorus: x4]

Stay golden shine for me today

We're going on a treasure hunt
Care to come along?
Diamonds, emeralds, rubies and a list of jewels this long
It could be so adventurous

Superficial living made her life a drag
World stereotypes her as she coins the phrase
Living for the hot wax and the printed page
She no longer wants to boss the bull around

All she wants to do is get inside your head
And play the fun rythms of the street

Says that love will someday reign throughout this land
Says he's glad you let him try it all again

All he wants to do is spread his eagle wings
And fly south for the winter just like me

The reggae of the Rastaman

So just give her what she needs
You make me feel like drifting
Through my golden years

Thoughts of you go to my head
You turn me on - Oh you do heave
You tailor-make me

And I'm dressed in secret fears
Thoughts of you go to my head
You turn me on - Oh you so heavy-heavy-heavy",You So Heavy,1986
Teena Marie,"Turn around to see you
In a crowded place
I watch for the emotions
On a guarded face
Saying lead me on

Victim of a dream
And a memory
But when I try to break free
You say to me
C'mon lead me on

A matter out of time
In the reaches of space
Caught up in the patterns
In the light of a life
Walk across the bridge
To the shadows of the night

Saying lead me on
Lead me on
Lead me on
On and on
Lead me on
Lead me on
On and on
Lead me on

Voices in the night
Chase the demons away
Looking in the mirror
It's easy to say
C'mon lead me on

The choices of a lifetime
In the dreams of a day
When the coast is gettin' clearer
I hear you say
C'mon lead me on

A matter out of time
In the look on your face
Caught up in the patterns
In the light of a life
Walk across the bridge
To the shadows of the night

Lead me on
Lead me on
On and on
Lead me on
Lead me on
On and on

Talk to me of lightning
I'll hear what you say, my love
Reaching for the meaning all of the way
I can't keep believing in you and me, my love
Finding the answers that we need
Sometimes it's meant to be

Lead me on, lead me on
Turn around to see you
In a crowded place
I watch for the emotions
As they cross your face
Saying lead me on

I see you in a dream
And a memory
A captive of the light
You say to me
C'mon and lead me on
Lead me on
C'mon and lead me on

Teena Marie,"Tender I remember, how you loved to turn me on
Sweetly so completely, when you sang your sassy song
Did you have a lighthouse, Yes, I'm sure indeed you did
Where you used to take me, where the family jewels were hid

You said, ""Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball""
Take me to the ball
You said, ""Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all""
Take me to the ball

The ball, the ball, sang your sassy song, sing it
The ball, take me to the ball

There was sugar sweet as candy, there was sweetness on your lips
And you sang it in a love song, and confection surely drips
There was laughter and then after, when we could have danced all night
We got into one another, and I know you know that's right

You said, ""Can I, can I, may I, can I, take you to the ball""
Take me to the ball
You said, ""Can I, can I, love you, can I, love you after all""
Take me to the ball

I remember how we danced, when you were mine
How we played ""the suite"" romance and all was fine
How we always took the chance to be divine
Love was always happening, love was happening at the, the ball

The ball was fine-all the time-trying to blow my mind, baby
Take me to the ball
When we danced-to the beat-of a different drummer, baby
Take me to the ball-play it

Teena Marie,"Early morning whispers to me
I was taken unaware
I remember sunlight creepin'
In the window over there
The day had promised true love

Smiles awaken as we rise
Our golden slumbers long gone
Only you got in my eyes
And now I'll never be the same
'Cause you made me over

That you are my only lover and it's wonderful

I remember fingers floating
As you held me hypnotized

And now, Honey, I'm not the same

Baby, I would ring through every valley

If I were your bell
Baby, I would ring each day for you

I'm gonna sing about you one more time

I have no choice but to carry the choice, but to carry a torch
Come here, Honey
Let me make it all right

I'm gonna ring for you, baby
You know the part, baby

That every little bit of you lives inside of me
Time after time you give 'em to me
Those butterflies got me spinning like a top
I don't want to stop baby I'm
I'm like a puppet on a string and

Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses
Keep me away from you my baby

No chance 'cause I've traveled fast through time
Just for you to be here with me blowing my mind
And it is going to take me about a thousand years baby
Just to let you know, that this love will never die
And no one could ever make me tell you goodbye

Time after time you give 'em to me
Those butterflies got me spinning like a top
I don't want to stop baby I'm
I'm like a puppet on a string
And

Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses can't keep me away
Wild horses can't keep me away

My lips begin to burn and my heart beats faster than the normal pace
I try to resist that familiar smile, it melts me just like wax
But what's the use, I'm yours and that means forever, there's no turning back
Baby, baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never been so sure, what am I gonna do?

I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again

Sweeter than the taste of a midnight rendevous, so sensual
The look upon your face when you love me tender and my cup was full
Softer than the sigh when it all was over and I slumbered deep
Lost inside your love like there's no tomorrow as I fall back to sleep

Baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never felt so sure

You reached out and touched my hand

And no one could have stopped our love affair

But lately we can't even see each other, no
Without acting just like distant lovers
We've even took to fighting under covers

I-I guess that with our love that too has flown

Up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're banging on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang homey
If I'm hanging it's with DPG

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's fast
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But it's steel, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Hey yo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket
And make a loot, niggas want trip
Spitting like ""you spoke beef from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit""
Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say
""it's the wagy to get paid"", DP's and pay
I don't know why you want to get on my back? (why?)
Tripping 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you should of roll
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from Seth be trying to set you 'cause you setting your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Just what we need, banging on wax another trip
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mother-ship?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
Cause, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missing
Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossing
But guess what it cost em, they crossing me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

Teena Marie,"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big Turkish wole with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flaunting and won't it speaking
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb with the beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down wit his starks untied
And a blue and gray cap that said the east-side
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nothing but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass transform wit finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at the V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offering him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussing

the vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
after getting rejected, I ain't running upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?'  Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-see straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listening to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
""We used to see Daz, back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You got the papers",Vapors,1996
Teena Marie,"My baby's fine
He always keeps me guessing
But never keeps me guessing about his love
He's had more girls than Howard Hughes had money
And you may think it funny when I say he loves me only
And who are you to say what he did when I was not around
Just because I fell in love with Casanova Brown
Act 2 scene 5 is my command performance
My name is clairvoyance and it's all too clear

I was the one
Who said tune in tomorrow
I think about tomorrow, even when I am asleep and
Who are you to say
What I did when you weren't around
Just because I fell in love with you

Of the pie
Of you and I

That the tears fall harder than the whole dam crowd
Throw it down my love
Is just about all I can do
Wasn't I the one who said
I'll have my cake and eat it to
Just couldn't wait any longer
You pushed till I was through

I love you so
It hurt me but I had to let,
Let you go
Did you hear me crying, baby
It sounded a little bit like this
You didn't have to make me cry
Tell me again and I'll tell you why, 
It's over.

It's over

Does it hurt me? Yes indeed.

I've heard it said that all is fair in love and war,
But tell it like it is, does the distance hide the scar
Living our lives all alone, changing,
Never really knowing what games we're playing (oh baby),
Laughing when we should have both been praying
(living, I'm living a lie)

You are the rush and the flow of every river,
Soft as the touch of love when you want to be the giver.
How do I know
I guess I just imagined
Painfully so

Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes indeed

You Broke my spirit
All those nights I cried

Do I love you? Yes indeed.",Ballad of Cradle Rob & Me,2000
Teena Marie,"Hey, baby, how you doin'
Wow, huh, it's really been a long time
You know
Remember that night
You remember

On a starry winter night in Portugal
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore
There a dream I never thought would come to pass
Came and went like time spent through and hourglass

You made love to me like fire and rain
Ooh, you know you've got to be a hurricane
Killing me with kisses, oh, so subtly
You make love forever, baby
You make love forever

[Bridge:]
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
You've got to say you love me too
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
I'm gonna give it all to you

[Chorus:]
Portuguese love
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese love
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese love
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese

Harbor nights, we made love till the morning star
Then you crooned a song to me on your guitar
Was it so familiar calling soft my name (Teena)
Sunlight dancing slowly through loves window panes

And you made love to me like sugar and spice
Hush my broken heart, this must be paradise
Killing me with kisses, oh, so tenderly
You make love forever, baby
You make love forever

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Amore Portuguese
Say you love me, baby
Amore Portuguese
Say you love me, baby

Yo quiero a la ser amor
A feeling too hard to ignore
Say amore Portuguese
You've got to say you love me

You knew that you felt good to me, oh, baby, oh
From the first kiss to the last I'm trembling
You made love to me like no other man
And if you please I'd like to go back there again
Killing me with kisses, oh, so tenderly
You make love like, wee
You make love forever

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Amore, amore Portuguese
Aye, say you love me (Portuguese love)
Amore, amore Portuguese
Aye, baby, aye, aye Portuguese love

Say, say, baby, aye, aye, hey, hey (Portuguese love)
Portuguese amore, amore Portuguese
Say, say, say aye, say aye, aye, aye, hee

Love me
Say you love me
Love, love me (I love you)

Say you love me, baby

Maybe that will express what I've been going through (I love you)",Portugese Love,2000

To bring some peace into my world

It's really good to see you again, baby
And I must admit you're looking very, very, very nice these days
I guess life must be treating you well
Oh, me?
Well, I've just been doin' the same ol' thing I've always been doin', you know
I've got a new lady now
And it's a little different then it was when I was with you
You know, I think back to when we met
The way I used to be and the cold way I used to act
But more than that, I think of how you changed me with your love and sensitivity
Remember when I used to

Love them and leave them
That's what I used to do
Use and abuse them
Then I laid eyes on you, it was pain before pleasure

I was cold as ice long ago, baby, baby
I wasn't very, very, very nice, you know
Sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips and you tuned on my fire, baby
And you burned me up within your flame
Took me a little higher
Made me live again, you turned on my fire, baby
Then you showed me what a love could do
Fire and desire, baby
Feel it comin' through
And I thank you, baby

Oh, how I thank you, baby
You taught me so much and you showed mw so much and love and insensitivity
That since you've been gone I don't think I've ever felt this way before
You know it's funny how a man can change so quickly from a cold-blooded person
Thinkin' he's God gift to women
Remember how I used to do that?
I must have been crazy then

Fire and desire (fire and desire)
And we're both to blame, both to blame

You know
I guess I think we both said a little too much today (no, ooh)
After all, Tee, you're kind of with somebody else
I'm kind of livin' with somebody
But please do me a favor just before you go (what is it, baby?)
Just put your arms around me and hold me like you used (I want to hold you tight)

This song is a dedication to those strugglin' and livin' on
For those who can't see the light, it's comin'
Stay strong, feel me

[Teena Marie]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah,

[Chorus: Teena Marie]
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

[Eve]
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year

Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me

No doubt I struggle, I cry at times
Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down

Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me

Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me
And it's funny, 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life, or they want my money

[Chorus]

[Teena Marie]
How can life be so hard?
How can my life be so hard?
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Every day I pray to God
Every day I pray
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Eve]
Been through a lot
Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Close is to do you dirty just so they can take your spot
Some days I feel like I want to quit

But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin tricks
Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind

I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes

Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin,' claimin' realness but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely

I feel like people see me really don't know me
But my best friend is Him, and I know He'll hold me

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I got a lot of people on my side protectin' me
Dee, Waah, Chivon, and the family
Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right

I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him, for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans; I love the way they love me

Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin, livin lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lot of people think I'm lucky, travelin and hangin out

But if they only knew, I +WISH+ I could be hangin out
I'm bangin out hits, in the studio I'm livin low
Makin plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin dough
Huh, come on, just so the people know
Uhh, come on, just so the people know

Baby I Love You (I love you baby)

Late night creeping down the blvd,
Rollin through the shaw like ma and pa,
In my lap full of luxury, feeling free its you and me
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it
Because Yo love be the bomb

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're rolling up close on a brand new day
The love we have boy alway stays in my mind
Like a real fine wine..always tender
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it 'cause this love be the bomb

It came down on me like a rain storm,
Glissens and dances
Drippin like dew drops from silver saxs
Hollywood player, sweet ear candy licks
Sexy jb pump sounds in the background
Calm down baby baby
I got you open like a door make you holler for more
Sweet things on the killin floor
Make love not war for sure

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're Late night creeping down the blvd,
Rollin through the shaw like ma and pa,
In my lap full of luxury, feeling free its you and me
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it
Because Yo love be the bomb

I make you feel good. I make you feel real good
Whenever we're together.
Chillin in the cut, Philly blunt like December
Mix it in my blender.
Make it mo better mo better
Its weak my baby when your not around
And I'm weak so weak when your putting it down on me
You be the amproshia I swill, diggin on x factor
Swear I will

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're rolling up close on a brand new day
The love we have boy alway stays on my mind
Like a real fine wine..always tender
Just swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it 'cause this love be the bomb

Crystal and cream these dreams are made of
Curled up on the sofa where we just made love
Sometimes a lil risk ain't never too nasty
What do you want? Oh Baby just ask me.
I love it when you whisper Lady T in my ear

How do you like it? Tell me how it feels?
Say you love me baby
And now we're Late night creeping down the blvd,
Rollin through the shaw like ma and pa,
In my lap full of luxury, talk to me baby please
Swing down, sweet chariot star
Give me one more hit of it

Just build a nice house with an ocean view

Give me a Blues
Yeah, that's what I'm talking 'bout

Fell in love with the Harlem Blues,
Even though he was a Moulin Rouge,
Hazel eyes seems to be unfair,
Cajun moon makes me stop and stare,

Gotta reach up to touch the ground,
Blaze my box, embrace the sounds,
Tell me boy where do you dance?
Should I run or take the chance?

You're so pretty baby and I know just what to do. . .

Harlem Blues, Harlem Blues,

Lost my mind on a Harlem Brown,
Savoir faire, it was a man about town,
Fine as wine when he puts on the riffs,
Sets the mood indigo with his lips,

I been down that road before,
What I say? And furthermore,
I had myself a Romeo,
And I dropped it on him nice and slow,

Met him down on Bourbon Street,
I guess you know the rest. . .

Harlem Blues, Harlem Blues,

The way you move give me a Harlem Blues,
The way you light my fuse, what a girl supposed to do?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh got me all over you,
Baby it's tried and true,
Give me a Harlem Blues,

Guess who I saw today?
Casanova Brown,
Gave me the blues in my left thigh,
Get on down,

Get so weak when he kiss you,
I'm undone, I got issues,
Oh and yes did I mention,
If he played he'd be Kenton?
He's so fine, he's so mellow,
In his eyes, greens and yellows,
And when he starts and love me,
Rainy days become sunny,

You're so pretty baby and I know just what to do. . .

Wait for me be merciful be kind
Embrace the joy in pain when love is blind

And if you cry just know that I would never say goodbye
If you speak of me just by chance
Or hear me calling through your next romance
I am the thorn that wants to be the closest to the rose you are 
Kind of blue be virtuous at best
To know the pain of too much tenderness

And if you cry 
Just know that I could never tell a lie
If you hear my voice just by chance
Or feel me touch you in a lover?s dance

The kiss would give me much more potency

Ask me what you want
And I’ll give you the world on a silver platter baby
Here I stand holding a heart so true
And if that doesn’t do
Baby, then I’ll try something new

What you wanna do?

Handle your business baby
I’m gonna let you handle me
I’m gonna let you dive beneath the hour baby
I’m giving you the power over everything

So nice with it baby
I’m gonna let you handle me

And to be out on my own again

Well I had me a girl, but she couldn't understand
Me and my ways, and my need to be around
Left her today, took my life in my hands
And now I'm free again

Well I'm free again, to do what I wanna do
Free again, to sing my song again
Free again, to air my longing,
And to be out on my own again

Well I made a mistake, and thought I could turnaround,
Thought I could take, a leash on my neck, around
Now I'm gonna make, my way to another
Til my feet are back on the ground

Yes I'm free again, to do what I wanna do
Free again, to sing my song again
Free again, to air my longing,

Personality when your mind starts to blend

Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend

Ließt du mich näher ran als nur an dein Höschen, dein Höschen
Du jagst mir Gedanken in den Kopf, Spindeln mein Herz
Atme scheint gestoppt, nur'n schlechter Scherz
Und auch wenn ich sag, mich kann's nicht bewegen
Ist es nur ein weiterer Tag ohne dich in meinem Leben

Am ende des Tages kümmert sich niemand um die Herzen dieser Leute
Und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind, dann leben sie noch heute
Und wir sehen gerne zu, lesen in 'nem Märchenbuch
Es war einmal, es war einmal
Und ich hoff' du hörst gerne zu
Denn dann zeig ich dir mein Märchenbuch
(ich hasse Märchen), es war einmal

Aber nicht so schlimm, ich will dir doch nur zeigen
Dass wir nicht so sind, wie die Leute uns erwarten
Ich glaub an uns und wir brauchen uns nicht ändern
Wenn die Richtung stimmt, und jetzt geh ich ohne dich 30 Blocks
Küss mich wieder Süße, ohne dich bleib ich Frosch
Bin fleißig, noch aber fern von den Elfen
Mir fehlen die Märchen, wer soll mir helfen
Steh vor deiner Burg und ich wart auf Wunder
Zier dich nicht so, lass dein Haar herunter
Fragst dich, ob du einen besseren findst
Obwohl du weißt ich bin der letzte Prinz
In diesem Land voller Heuchler, Täuscher Diebe
Alles für dich selbst, aber nichts für die Liebe
Aber nicht so schlimm, ich will dir doch nur zeigen
Dass wir nicht so sind

Dann war sie einfach so weg 
Und glaub mir wirklich, keiner weiß wo sie steckt 
Und deshalb häng ich gerade nur verplant in meinem Zimmer rum

Oh, ich erinner’ mich
Es bedeutet, dass du niemals der Gewinner bist
Denn du denkst, dein ganzes Leben ist ein Hindernis
Wenn du ’n Leben lang im Sommer in dei’m Zimmer sitzt
Ja, ich war auch so wie du, glaub mir
Das Glück wartet nicht auf dich vor der Haustür
Doch dann traf ich sie, ooh
Und plötzlich kam das Glück nur so aus mir
Setzte alles und fiel zu tief
War sowas von am Ende, dachte, ich komm’ nie mehr wieder hoch
Doch im dunkelsten Moment konnt’ ich irgendwas erkennen
Und ich riss mich zusammen und ging über Luft

Denn dieses Leben ist mein (Jackpot, Baby)

Doch heut ist alles nicht mehr so schlimm
Ich zeig’s dir, ich hab’s jetzt
Ich mein’, das Leben ist doch gar nicht so schwer
Glaub mir
Oh Lord
Denn da draußen gibt es noch so viel mehr
Da draußen viele Menschen, die auch pausenlos nur denken
Über tausend Konsequenzen mit ’nem Haufen großer Ängste
Und sie laufen und sie rennen, mir geht’s von außen aus nur blendend
Na, dann macht doch, was ihr wollt, ich bin da draußen, um zu dancen
Mann, ich laufe an den Wänden, mache Backflips
Ich weiß, dass irgendwie alles perfekt ist
Zusammen mit Teesy und paar raus, Dicker, nie wieder nach Haus
Denn wir leben jeden Tag in diesem riesengroßen Traum

Und setzen alles auf schwarz, sag den Leuten an der Bar
Es wird höchste Zeit, laut zu singen
Und danke für die Blumen und den Schnaps was ’ne wunderbare Nacht

Teesy,"Ich wollte eigentlich 'ne Karte schicken
Ich musste einiges geraderücken
Doch dann fing ich an rücksichtslos zu tief in dieses Glas zu blicken
Ich wollte einiges loswerden
Doch irgendwas hat mich aus der Bahn gerissen
Jetzt drei Uhr Nachts
Ich weiß nicht, was mich davon abhält Schlaf zu finden
Vielleicht ist es das Bier
Vielleicht auch der Fakt, dass du weg bist
Ich weiß nicht - ich glaub', dass ich das Gefühl für was falsch und echt ist verlier'
Ich komm' nach Haus, doch ich fühl' mich als war ich zehn Semester nicht hier
Ich hör' den Anrufbeantworter ab - wer spricht da? letztlich nur wir
Raus zu der Stelle von uns
Kann nicht aufhören hier lang zu laufen
Situation zu tot um noch dran zu glauben
Ich glaub heut' fang' ich an zu Rauchen
Fünf Uhr kein Zeichen

Ich dreh' meine Runden in der dunkelsten Nacht
Ohne dich
Ohne dich

Du hättest anrufen sollen an dem Punkt, wo es noch nicht zu spät war
Wo vielleicht noch was zu retten gewesen wäre
Um zu klär'n was dir letztlich gefehlt hat
Was zwischen uns stand, war'n etliche Meter
Und lästige Fehler, Gott, was für'n ätzendes Thema
Und ich erinner' mich gut an deine Worte
Du sagst: ""Lass uns weg von hier, irgendwo hin""
Ich sag': ""Fuck, kleine Maus, bist du wirklich so blind?""
Und sie steht da in ihrem wunderschönen Kleid
Und ich flunker' irgend'n Scheiß über unsere größte Zeit
Die noch kommt, denn sie ist nichtmal hier
Und sie schaut mich an, als wär was wichtiges passiert
Ich sag': ""Raus damit, ich behalt's für mich, was ist es, sag's mir""
""Ich bin schwanger - und es ist nicht von dir""
Ich lache erst, dann sag ich: ""Warte kurz, ich glaub' ich hab' den Witz nicht kapiert!""
Und nun bin ich hier, kein' Plan um was oder wen es noch geht
Ich vermiss' dich
Ich wünscht' du wärst hier

Ask ya self, is you ready for the hardcore?

Ask ya self if you ready for drama
With two of the baddest motherfuckers ever to create, tunes to a lama
You fucking with the best

Then ask you self if you ready for Tef

And if you ready for death, pull all the steps out

I'm one of the five Horsemen, gimme twenty four hours to live
And I'll swell with a baked beans outta Boston
Proceed with caution, I'm about to wig out
To the skit, on the D&D-project, blew the shit out

By accident, we do some shit on the mic
That a kid is convicted in Interstate, trapped again
Fuck, y'all talking 'bout after we kick a hole
In the speaker then pull the plug, we walking out

Than this bullet can chamber?

We hit off heavy metal to settle to be frequently
And that's all me

Thinking you can talk sideways from the sound woofer
No prove of action

For you tucking-truck rhymes?

Testing me and Tef is like me and you laugh
And we'll announce a breath from holy you nnothing

Lemme go, hold up dog, hold up

Feelin' brave hearted, try me on a song
I'm a let niggaz know, they got it confused
You got gats and bats we get those too

Semi's and macks cocked and aimed at you
Bloodthirsty, star what the worst be
No mercy, we god and bang hard with any squad or mobb
Coming forty niggaz like a jail yard

Blood on my silk shirt, choke niggaz out
Scuffed up my Timbs, we bang 'em in the mouth
You niggaz want a concrete rebel
Pulling out busting like war in the jungle

Mad 'cause my crew lay bubble in the tunnel
Most humble, we send shots when we come through
Get praised but still blaze in the battle
The ruff days, these two bullets niggaz tattle

I'm immune to them tuff-talk, them big boy stanze
You coming in pairs, then two bodies by the stairs
Nigga we bang with the best, the models to rest
Create drama, rock armor, Smith & Wess-ons

Blood shot, gun cocked, mingling shotting
Lost in this world I'm in, feeling money rhyming
Eyes roaming, zoning, looking with a Nottz beat
Label most dangerous, police lay and watch me

Harts start jumping, we peeping niggaz fronting
We come through thumping, pulling out dumping
Tangle with your best entourage

We coming in yards to face off with any yards
Soldier you're dust on the fully loaded shotgun
Whistling throughout the air, just to mock one
Blood for your socks son

Is you ready for the hardcore
The hardcore
And after Krumb Snatcha snatch yo' worthy possessions
I got strict orders to clap you

I was there for your sickness and your pain
I was there when your dad wouldn't call your name
I was there when the bills were too much
Held you down no matter, always showed loved
On your birthday no I didn't forget
If you got stranded then it was like no sweat
I'd be there even faster than a Corvette
Held you tight at night like a corset
I, finally start to feel like I know you
I know you
And they, will tell you in a minute they don't owe you
Don't owe you

And low budget telethons
Ain't like watching you yourself
When you yourself is on
Got time to wander to waste and to whine

It seems like I just can't find the time

So watch your head and then watch the ground

When you start to drown
It's a silly time to learn to swim
On the way down

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Promise me you'll always stay

I'm gonna win the endless war
Over who kills the last koala bear
And who in death will love him more then I

Where have they gone?

Did you take them to tease me?
To follow or lead me?

For the sound of the door
If they want you, they'll take you

And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help

Chorus:
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my looks in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

Chorus

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all night
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

Chorus

You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire

I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse
I might stay out longer than I left the light on for you
Then if you show, you show
If you show, you show

When I feel like this
When I get so into myself
I lose track of where I'm going and lose track of how to get going again
I feel myself slowing down
Feel myself turning around
Is this taken?

When I feel like this
When I get so sick of myself
Where are you going now without me
And not knowing then, that we're slowing down
You've gotta turn that around
And tell me that I'm taken, tell me if I'm yours

You collapse
The pressure of this life is so
You can't be held accountable
If you go, you go
If you go, you go
When you act like this
When you get so sick, of yourself
The whole world falls away and since I feel
Like I have only missed the feeling that I'm here again
The feeling that I'm clear again
I'm not taken

When you act like this
When you get so into yourself
I lose sight of common goals
And letting go so I can be all alone
Feel myself, going slow
Feel myself, letting go

Not taken, not feeling like I'm yours

If you're taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse
This life looks like a sentence, though
A constant game of falling short
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

When I feel like this
When I'm just so sick of feeling less than perfect
Is it right for me
I never fight to see if coming clean would get to me
I feel myself, holding back
I feel the pressure, it's finally back
I'm taken

When you feel like this
When you saw it call come crashing down
Subtle but not underground
I was there
I saw the signs, I saw unfair
And so I write to you through other means
I let myself finally feel taken
Like I was yours

If you're taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken, I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse

Goes afraid go to change just move away
For days that I mention in a song move along

From the heart and the soul of the city side and cold
For ways to collect what we say and what we save
To discard and discover a brand new way

When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too

Golden brown from the sun
Your arms outstretched, your hair cut shorter than it'd been
But still blowing in the wind

When I picture you, I think of your smile
And it drives me wild
Your laugh escaping you, your head thrown to the side
And it drives me wild

You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us
You clung to self-restraint, you followed your plan
You put the brakes on this

And it drove me
And it drove me

Tangled up beneath me
Your body inching close, closer to the edge
I got a hold of you then

Las ganas tuyas de cantar más que yo
Con mi producción, loco, te humillo
A la puerta del estudio ponle pestillo
Prende la alarma en contra de los pillos
Es que, por ahí hay mucho loquillo
Que se enfurecen cuando yo brillo
Dicen que tienen más quioscos que en Luquillo
y no han vendio' ni un sinquillo 
Con medio posillo los acribillo
Ando siempre solo sin corillo 
soy sencillo, nunca me guillo
afueguillo ni le paso el rastrillo
A tu katana suéltale cabillo
y saca el deo del gatillo
Antes de que te fundan el bombillo
O que te guarden en El Castillo

A mí no me haces falta
Si tú quieres, juégate la carta
Compra una pistola, haste un pal' de marcas
Guillate de monstro o si fuera pero mera
la calle sabe que eres un pera

Si tú quieres, juégate la carta

No me copio, salí con un flow muy propio
Al envidioso le quito lo fantasmioso
En el Oso, Mendoza, asociao' somos poderosos 
Corte mafiosos, antecedentes dudosos
Sé lo que pasa sin mucha lata 
Si te zafas con mi raza te quemo las patas 
Ni tú, ni tu marido, ni tu pobre cochinchillo
Esto es sencillo pero en grande como Vadillo
Así que no te meta en camisa de once baras
O terminará en la cruz como Mara
O Penélope, problema evítate
No confunda la humildad del Abayarde
Lo que tú 'ta haciendo ahora yo lo hice en el nueve tre'
Pregunta por ahí, si tú no me crees
Madura, ni en esta vida ni en la futura me dura
Si nos vamos de verdura 
Hay que ser bruto o estar fumando basuco
¿A caso tú no oyes este trabuco?
Se creen que saben, pueden que los pelos caguen 
Callejón o musical, conmigo no sale

A mí no me haces falta

Ponte en algo, acelera morena
Que se te va el avión
Y si no avanzas te quedas

Pa la nueva era
Un poco de vieja escuela
Que te pone a prueba
Y a la vez te eleva
La naturola, no es de fangola ni rola
Desde rio grande barrio carola

Pal mundo entero este boricueo
Guapeo,fraseo, calchanchaneo
Les dije que mi libreta esta repleta
De letra' hasta las tetas
Mas especiales que topeka

Sigo gozando, haciendo el aguaje
No hay coraje,
Salir del clandestinaje
Yo combino lo que opino con lo que domino
Y lo decoro con mi flow latino

Yo se que no te gusto que viniera
Pero estoy aquí, soy la candela así que brega
Te molesta
Mi orgullito esta pimienta
Si yo soy el que te orienta con cositas como esta

Dando po' el cocote cada vez que pauta (que fue?)
Aguanta que llego grampa
El aballarde
Que dios te salve de calde
Si la dicha es buena nunca es tarde

Con chavos compras to' pero no este flow
Dont you know?
Si no tienes na lay low
Solo un kumi con carabali
Hache pa ti
Que naci con el don en mi

Hey!

Salte 'el medio
Que voy pasando
Demostrando como es el mambo
Ampliamente
Distinto y diferente
Como le gusta a mi gente

Oye!
Salte 'el medio
Que voy pasando
Demostrando como es el mambo
Traigo un swing como clemente potente
El caballote aunque este ausente

Aha
Eco ahi!
Eco ahi, quema?
Jaja

Tego Calderón,"Llego a la disco y te veo a ti
Qué bien te ves al caminar así
Sé que quieres bailar
De eso se diga más
Acércate a mí mujer que
Te quiero sentir
Junto a mi cuerpo siente la pasión
Profundo, como hacer el amor
Siente la música
Tu cuerpo pide más
Suéltate de una vez que quiero sentir tu piel

Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace suspirar
Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace (Me hace)

Vamo'a la barra, te invito a tomar
¿Quieres beber Moët o prefieres Cristal?
Siente la música
Tu cuerpo quiere más
Hasta el amanecer te quiero complacer
Veo el reloj, no lo puedo creer
Diez de la mañana, qué vamos hacer
Vmonos al hotel
Sé que quieres placer
No te resistas, solo quiero sentir amor

Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace suspirar
Tus ojos son
Como el cristal
Niña, tu cuerpo me hace suspirar

A mí me gustan las gatas que me dejan guardar mi corta en su bolsa
A las de que ni les importa, mami
Cuando te veo lo que siento es un cosquilleo
Como si estuviera en pleno canchechateo
¿Tú quieres bailar? No te me des guille
Si quieres gritar, grita hasta que te me galilles
Suéltate, mujer, que lo que quiero es sentir tu piel
Y es que tú te ves de lo mas aquel
Tus ojos son como el cristal
Tu cuerpo me hace suspirar
Y al bailar es como si estuviéramos al natural
Dándole a la masucamba, no cogas la joyilanga
Esto es Calde' y Maestro comiendo nalga
Otra cosa 
Pero bellacosa bien pegajosa
Cuando lo viste te quedastes sosa
Llegó el bravo de borinquén bella, el de la mella
No soy estrella, pero sigo dejando huellas (Jaja!)

Tego Calderón,"Oye,El turno es del feo así que tírate, tápate 
En vez de uno son tres de la paste los mariè, 
Como el te tira como las ve, de la escuela de vico y el edd 
A ti se te tranco el bolo con el cocolo 
(¿Como?) 
Tus sueño de grandeza los esmorona negrolo 
Y eso que estan culpandonos 
Ajorandonos, hablando bazofia marginandonos 
En ves de ser, Tego el que te canta 
Podria ser, Tego el que te asalta, saco e'trampa 
Lucho pa' que mi hija nunca pase hambre 
Por esa tienen que matarme 
Y no te crea que es de boca, pa' fuera cantoe'collera 
Me pongo necio en la ruñidera, 
Yo no tengo culpa de tu fracaso,payaso 
Dejame por loco y no hagas caso 
Oye lo que te conviene, llora, llora nene

Tu no pagas mis deudas, ni me das plata 
Y es que de verdad no amenaza, guasa guasa

Siente mi viaje 
Directo del clandestinaje 
Con un Flow salvaje 
No hay personaje que se preste pal sabotaje 
No hay quien pueda con el cangrinaje 
Hablan de mas, y no dan pa' na 
Se les acabo el aceite a sus lamparas 
Muchos Philly, muchas armas, mucho bling-bling 
Y ala hora de la verdad, salen huyendo como Hussein 
Esos mecanismo ya yo los conozco 
Llevan mil años tratando de tumbarme el quiosco 
No se comparan con la letra mía, 
Porque viven en la isla pero de la fantasía 
Pana mio, no te duermas con el trió 
Pa' nosotros esto es pan comió, 
Va muy ligero ni sueñes con ser primero 
Donde manda capitán no manda marinero 
Esto es conjunto pa' la historia 
De Puerto Rico pal mundo es victoria 
Haciendo cosas diferentes, 
Porque yo no estoy pegao yo le gusto a la gente 

Que yo no se porque ellos quieren tirar pa'ca

Aqui llego el mas que tiene muela 
Mas clasico que doña fela 
El arquitecto de la vieja escuela 
Y se cancelan los planes de los que me celan 
Ahora vamos a ver, si el gas pela 
Porque el pueblo mio come mucho mas que pacman 
Tengo mucho mas trucos que el cinturon de batman 
Tus palabras contra la mia se te gastan 
Con lo tuyo se aburren, con lo mio se arrastran 
Aqui esta el bueno, el malo y el feo 
Tirando tras nosotros cascaritas de guineo 
Pa'l que nos persiga se resbale, Fua 
Pa'l que habla del tecato y se le bira la quijà 
Gobierno, escucha bien mi queja,que tengo liricas 
Que pueden destrozar hasta el chicho de la oreja 
De mi abusaste tras las rejas, pero ahora estoy afuera 
(¿Que,Que?) 
Y mi defecto no me acompleja,So-salpica, brinca cuica, 
Que lo que tengo el pica pica tu no me ganas ni en canica 
Y mira aquien se lo explica, mastica

Pa que se enteren convivo hasta sin papeles

Y a esos pollitos que se viven mis canciones

Que son maleantes pero mañana pueden ser lechones.

A lo que gusta
Sino lo tengo se busca

Que la pista llena

Y de la silla los levanta
Sin hacer trampa bravo como alanca
Aquí no escampa

Y si te pones fresca te guayo

En lo claro vamonos y nos matamos
Sin compromiso acabamos y chekiamo
Echumbarte como un aguacero e mayo
Y dar tabla por ahí pa bajo hasta el desmayo
Galopéame como caballo
Hacer cabo, mucha cintura y te llevo el que te trajo
Mi flow le asusta porque se ajusta
A lo que gusta
Sino lo tengo se busca
Un nuevo sistema
Que la pista llena
Alegría pa' tu cuerpo sin macarena
La cosa se tranca
Ya no hay candanza
Llego el que canta
Y de la silla los levanta
Sin hacer trampa bravo como alanca
Aquí no escampa
Aguanta que llego grandpa

Mira quien llega, cosa buena
El negro Calde sin problema
No se apenen
Porque miren este sandungueo es pa las mujeres
No se alteren ni me fantasmeen
Pa que se enteren convivo hasta sin papeles
Sino te gusta el bellaqueo no me condenen
Datela pal carajo y no me suenen
Pa los gustos los colores
Le canto a los malechores
Y a esos pollitos que se viven mis canciones
Son supuesto reales que na componen
Que son maleantes pero mañana pueden ser lechones
Mi flow le asusta porque se ajusta
A lo que gusta
Sino lo tengo se busca
Un nuevo sistema
Que la pista llena
Alegría pa tu cuerpo sin macarena
La cosa se tranca
Ya no hay candanza
Llego el que canta
Y de la silla los levanta
Sin hacer trampa bravo como alanca
Aquí no escampa
Aguanta que llego grandpa

En peligro de extinción (en extinción pues como nosotros) 
(como yo) no hay en el montón (no hay en el montón) 
Me refiero a eddie dee, El terrorista (de la lírica) 
Junto a Tego calderón (la nueva adquisición) 

Vuelve el abayarde el tego calde 
El que deba algo mas vale que salde 
Cree que eso tirando lírica que arde 
Porque si la DJ buena nunca e tarde 
Y vine pa cantar cantar con mozilla
Quemando como el tequila, causando extragos como gozilla 
Te estas metiendo con el tipo equivocao
Tengo algo pa ti por ley, porque no se a presentao

Tu anda bien guillao, con un estilo copion
Con carro alquilao y un prendao pretao 
Mucho DJ te an grabao? cuanto te as ganao
Pa pelao, quemao porque te an utilizao

Vivo underground, reciclando lo que e sonao
Entre lo mejore me e paseao, no me an opacao 
El tumbao, que no es copiao ni inventao
Es eredao del borin que me dio otro lao 
En extinciona porque hacemos las cosas decora
Mientras otros buscan fama,billete y corona 
Su estilo no me impresiona (no me impresiona) 
Porque cuando mi voz detona

Toma, ahora en peligro de extinciona
Pues cantante como nosotros no hay en la zona 
Va de 'corazona' pa la 'persona'

Mucho meno que hagan lo que hacemo 
Ni que sepan lo que conocemo, hablo por mi 
Y por lo poco que bien esto hacemos 
Aunque muchos quieren quitarno lo que tenemo

Como esos que quieren dar censura al genero de rap 
Por culpa de cantantes que an tirao basura 
Quieren sacarno de la radio prensa y televisore
Pero y lo mejore vamo a paga junto por pecadore? 

Se que el loquillo al aplaude al gatillo, de guerra y mucho corillo 
Prueba que no estoy de acuerdo con la tiraera
Ni la copiaera, primero apoyo a los mios y luego a los de afuera
Y soy del ghetto, vengo para obtener respeto
No hago como otro que quieren actuar como moyeto

Te guta como el balla sunba? quiero que sepa que soy queso 
Y moreno porque nací de la rumba
Así que en vez de ta guillandote de genio
Trata de invertarte algo para este milenio
No pierda tanto tiempo tanto tiempo tratando de hundirme

Si vamos hablar de caco, tu me distes clases 
Con que moral 
Ahora nos quieren culpar 
Si los mas que nos critican son parte del mal 
Y yo no digo que no hay espacio pa' mejorar 
No me descargues tu frustración 
Mi crimen es musical 
Estoy legal 
Y se me trata como criminal 
Como si bregara con el Escamoso y no Pedro Coral 
Lo tienen de mango bajito 
Porque somos negativo pa' los chamaquitos 
Y Fajardo que se llevo hasta los esquimalitos 
Mano dura, pues tiran humo pa' los fredericos 
Aqui el que menos ha hecho se ha llevao un dron 
Mientras mas tienen mas quieren ta' cabrón 
Y si quieren mandenme a prisión con una fabricación 
A mi me importa un cojon 
La única diferencia entre usted y yo 
Es que yo soy de la calle y tu no 
Es que a mi sin control me tienen y a ti no 
Don't you know, esto es la Mision special edition

En uniforme, ni corbata y traje 
Ni al de tatuaje 
Somos iguales 
Así que velen sus modales 
El envidioso es mas malo que el que lleva y trae 
El que odia lo que no comprende 
Si yo lo único que hago es tirar disco a ver si venden 
Es un sueño hecho realidad 
Y hablo la verdad 
Pa' unos es ser doctor
Pa' mi era grabar hip-hop 
Que en la isla se supiera quien yo era 
Y los que hablaron mierda de mi se la comieran 
El que tenga miedo que se compra un AK 
No hay que haber ido a la NASA 
Pa' saber que tu eres guasa

Es el más guasa que habla, pero entretiene
Dame el chance, que tengo que comprar pamper
Y lo que yo tengo de blanco tu tienes de gangster
Deja el tiriri-tarara, que yo estoy viejo pa' eso ya

Al paso, pero dándole cuernazos,
Si tu metes mano yo meto to' el brazo
Oyeme simple pa' lo entiendan y pa' que afinquen,
Pa' que las gatas sus nalgas trinquen
Sí, llegó el feo que los tiene tirando peos,
Si yo no soy el mejor me paso entre ellos

Hey man, es mejor que tú ni mires pa'ca,
Porque hoy no tengo ganas de rebuliar

Tu crees que andas en un caballo, es una yegua chonga
Mientras yo fluyo en mi paso fino
No paso el cochino,
Primo sin pamplinas
Genuino, genuino
Yo soy el mascaracachimba cuando escucho la timba,
Me lambes la linda, la que me guinda
No hay perdón pa' nadie sigo dando cuerpo, corto de nuevo,
La clave, la suelto, la cojo y me la llevo
El único con el sonido es canchanchan
Soy veterano sin ir a Vietnam,
Y yo no uso diccionario,
Pues yo canto pa' to' los barrios
Y pa' las niches de dulces labios
Y yo no sé pa' tí pero pa' mí,
Es que mi estilo me lo están mascando
Disimulando la están disfrazando,
Por el culo los tengo meando
Una vez más ""El Aballarde"" sambo,
Pa' que sepan que no estoy jugando
Eah pujules, llegaron los Freddy Krueger's
Maestros en el ""bigi""
Y Calde con el ""puger""
Malos como los azules,
Verdes como los gandules
Pa' las mulatas que cuando bailan parecen de hule
No te vuelvas loko,
Ni te vaya a dar un vioco,
Cuando tu oigas to' este sahoco
El negro Calde', el Aballarde,
Si no te gusta el drama, pa' que te lambes

Me dieron las primeras planas

Solo quedara en su mente clara

Tego Calderón,"Julito Maraña, de mala maña, tira su hazaña
Ochenta trucos y mil artimañas
Se fuma un fili con un trago de caña
y con el magnun, a cualquiera el día le empaña

A los bichotes araña como piraña
Chamaquito que se junte con julito se daña
Le gusta la mataera, los asalto, y la cizaña
Nadie tira al medio un tipo de esa calaña

Ni los estatales, ni arrestos especiales y federales
Le encuentran causa en los tribunales
Por que ya to el mundo conoce todos sus males
No hay evidencia ni chota que lo señale

En el barrio le temen, porque el tipo es un bravo
y tiene al diablo agarrau por el rabo
No trabaja, siempre acicalau hasta el cabo
y te arranca la catrueca si tu no le das los chavos

Los otros días le fiaron un octavo
y a la semana el tipo fue cobrar los chavos
Julio sacó la nueve y lo rajó con el cabo
y el tipo corría mas que en el maratón del pavo

Mera puñeta esto es un asalto
Llaves del carro, cartera, el dinero y las prendas
y no me mires si no quieres que te tire
y tenme el billete ready pa la proxima que venga

Los liquor store, las a.t.h.s y en las tiendas
Ese pega punto y donde quiera que se venda
Mira si el tipo es malo y le gusta la jodienda
Que le quitó al pastor hasta los chavo e la ofrenda

Arrancó pa los NewYores pa la casa de su tía
A ver si se enfría los problemas que tenía
Allá con los tiguerasos hizo un par de fechorías
y en los altos de Manhattan la gente lo conocía

En la 42, hasta Broklyn, en el tramvia
To el que cogía mi hermanito se jodía
Se fué pa la isla fichau por la policía
y cuando vino, viró mas malo todavía

Por ahí anda Julito
En el barrio se decía
y creía que iba a meter las cabras
Como antes lo hacía

Ya no es lo mismo
Ya pasaron esos días
No confunda la humildad
Con la cobardía

Boca e trapo
Papi aquí to el mundo es guapo
Ahora matan por matar
y mas si tu eres un sapo

Hombre no, aquí yo soy el bravucón
Estos chamaquitos a mi me tienen un miedo cabrón
Deja que los alumbre con esta cuestión, mamón

Pero el tipo del octavo
Era dueño del callejón
Tenía al caserío caminando por la orilla
y los secuaces tenían babilla

y ya tenía como 15 en las costillas
Que tu crees que le pasé a Julito si el hombre lo pilla

Hey, Julito Maraña, Te acuerdas de mi cabrón
Que pajó quien carajo tu eres ?
Que me partiste el melón por el octavo
Clack, Clack
Mera a quien tu le sacas eso loco, mera canto e bobo, echa

Rip-ridin' them poles, and them doors is tight

Handful of niggas, n' they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me, now what's it gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryin' get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet  you rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' n' jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin', n' grinin', n' lookin' at me

Girl, n' while you're looking at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everythin' n' that's kinda scary
Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast, but I got a thing for you

Gente, llego el Chynin

Llegue tarde porque el carro no tenía rueda 
Pero paso tu era, que pena 
Mira, avísale que llego el nene nuevo de la vieja 
Con la disquera que le va tumbar la
Que me vo'a poner bien comemierda si mi disco pega 
Hacerle el remix a Christina Aguilera
Pa' que me crea; miren, cabrones
De que carajo son estas mollejas, ¿de pollo o de guinea? 
Que le pase el rolo de brea o le tire la paila entera 
Como sea, el narrista tiene rima pa' to' los días 
Aquí no hay mosquero porque yo soy el Real Killa'

Los mataba sin pero's, sin compasión

No se acuerdan del chamaquito de la villa 
Que los party's encendía y salía

Como un cabron infeliz que te figa con un tenedor

Que difícil se me hace sin ti 
Yo tenía que escribir 
Por que a quien se lo iba decir 
A veces me quedo a recibir su llamada 
Pa decirle que Malcom nació y que Bony lo ama 

No ha sido fácil pero estoy bregando 
Con la misma piedra, cucando 
Usted sabe lo que estoy hablando 
Estamos extrañándolo, representándolo 
Bajándola por la goma, recordándolo 
Y esta conmigo trabajando bien 
Ahora viene el disco nuevo para ver quien es quien 
Hey! 

Lo cojo suave lo mío esta seguro 
El Underdog pa, yo le vendo dos por uno 
Sigo bregando con los puercos de esta industria 
Pero esta to' bien uno se las busca 
Sigo pa' lante como me enseñaste 
Siempre evitando que el grande me aplaste 
Oye! 
Cogiendo las cosa día a día 
Si pierdo la razón, en el proceso sonría 

Hey! 
Por que bien se lo merecía la torta esta dividida 
Pa mis cría súper repartida 
Tengo Jiguiri record sigo cada día 
Hay mas de lo que soñé en mi alcancía 
Cante con la Fania 
Se que lo sabia, por que lo que no veía lo sentía 
En la Republica me censuraron por su canción preferida 
Esta to' bien, estamos al día 
En vivo el pésame hasta Sila Maria 
Sin ser artista como lo quería

Eh seguido pa' lante como me enseñaste 
Viejo 
Siempre evitando que el grande me aplaste 

Gracias a usted tengo la semilla 
De mi cultura miso de averdura 
Una escuela que hasta el mas rico quisiera 
Calderón y la raza del nombre Esteban 
El que siempre me apoyo y en mi talento creyó 
Ni si quiera estando preso las espalda me dio 
Gracia por la madre que usted me eligió 
Pa darme la vida, Pila Rosario la mejor 
La socia mía, que más que yo sufría 
Y al final del pozo los veía 
No me quejo pues los tuve 32 años a mi lao 
De mi estando pegao 
Estuvo presente en el clemente 
Bellas Arte con Gilberto con mi hermanito Vicente 
Que difícil se me hace sin ti, lo tenía que escribir 
Eres mi héroe, ídolo del más existir

Tego Calderón,"Me encuentro solo de nuevo, como antes 
Justo cuando pensaste que la encontraste 
Esta canción no es de amor es pa' no (matarte) 
Por tanto sufrimiento que me causaste 
Si esa era tu misión lo lograste disfruta 
Tengo la batuta, no te ponga bruta 
Quisiera saber cual fue el doctor que te vio nacer 
Y maldecirlo a el por ti mujer 
Por que ni mi odio te has de merecer 
Eres la hija ilegitima de lucifer 
Yo quisiera desaparecer pa no volverte a ver 
Quedarme sin un peso y no tenerte que mantener 

Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 
Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 

Si tu no aguantas te entiendo tienes razón 
Yo nunca te mentí conocías mi situación 
Te advertí que yo no era un bombón 
Si no me lo creíste aguanta el tropezón 
Por querer mis hijos me montan presión 
Departamento de la familia estoy claro en la manutención 
Pero se me impide con mi cría la relación 
Y mi frustración descargo en esta canción 

Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 

Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 

Yo nunca he violau la ley 54 
No me gusta el abuso, no apoyo el maltrato 
No to los padres son perros, ni to los perros son satos 
Ni soy un santo soy caco pero yo trato 
De llevar la fiesta en paz, no hay vuelta atrás 
Por mas bueno que uno sea pagan con maldad 
Con un rencor punzante y con un tumbau de gangster 
Confunden la mentecita de nuestra infante 

Oh dios, oh dios

Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 

Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 

La ley es ley, lo claro es lo claro 
Las madres no toas son buenas 
Ni to los padres son malos 
Señores sus errores, sus decisiones 
Las pagan los menores, analizen bien 
Cada caso es diferente, los niños lo agradecerán 
Ya verán, ya verán 

Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario 

Oh dios, oh dios 
La paciencia se me acabo 
Oh dios, oh dios 
Que sienta pena quien te pario

Nunca habla de lo vivido 
Hace lo que haya que hacer y nos fuimos 
Cantenmela simple pero con sentido 
Pa sonar calle no hay que presentido 
Ser negativo ni tan cochinchillo

Aquí en la calle se te fue la credibilidad 
Tu no tiene amigo 
Tu no tiene gente 
Tú anda con testigo

Y anda por ahí 
Más cagao que un pamper 
Y ustedes saben que no son de cora 
Meten cabra en to lao menos en la emisora

Pero cuando zumbo se pican 
Ninguno vive lo que predican

Que son unos bobos crillao 
La culpa es mía por tenerlos mal acostumbraos 
Por dejársela pasar cuando piden cacao 
Tego me llamo pa tirarle en el Underdog 
Pues para echarlo no hace falta glock

Con violencia no hay progreso
Metele muñeca rompete los sesos 
Y dime algo en el proceso 
Pa que lo que escucha salgan ganadores 
Soy la conciencia en los jodedores 
Y a mí sin cebones 
Si suenan los cloes 
Se aprenden algo los menores

Underdog significa, echate pa' atrás

Oye, esta ves sali con maldad 
Ya estuvo bueno metale capacidad 
Pare ya, háblame de la verdad 
Por que esta serenidad no es real ni na 
Por que yo mate un poco e gallo lo míos malo 
Y ustedes en nombre e papa cuantos mataron 
El otro día a mi pana lo trancaron 
Masacro a una gente que su hija le violaron 
Y a su hermano lo condecoraron los americanos 
Por matar fulanos que ni lo miraron 
Entiendes lo que te hablo, justicia basura 
Tu eres el que hace leyes por eso te curas 
No pudiste con Osama la cojiste con Saddam 
Chulería sin tan tan 
Muchos tuyos caídos, madres sin sus hijos 
Por eso el combo preferido mio es el de Cortijo 
Mi mayor virtud es mi mayor defecto, el talento 
De verdad ciento diez por ciento 
Por que el centavo es el que vale menos 
Por que en los barrios pobres se vende veneno 
Como llego aquí, quienes lo trajeron 
No sabemos, nosotros la hecha no tenemos 
Tanta gente flasa, poca cosa 
Se oye como invoca, la pedigueña es la que choca 
De cuando la fe se compra con billete mister 
Y se puede bellaquiar con las sisters 

Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas 
Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demás 
Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas 
Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demás

Que coge cualquier caso por chavos, bravo bravo 
Delincuente hasta depravado 
Como el de plaza, que tiro el baby pa' abajo 
Luego pasan a ser fiscal, el que te tira con to 
El que te quiere trancar 
Pa otro día, convertirse en su señoría 
Papeles que chocan y no se desvían 
Igualdad pa todos, di mejor pa' tos los de tu coro 
Que lavan los cuellos de sus camisas con clorox 
Yo te soy franco, no es que sepa tanto 
Al lao de ustedes yo soy un santo 
Yo veo las cosas ami manera
Sin partidos sin banderas 
La verdad es la verdad y es hija e Dios 
El tipo se creyo es el Mesias y to 
Mi naturaleza, mi crianza 
Traerla como es con elegancia 
Hablar lo que siento que debo 
Y seguir siendo simplemente Tego 
El apaga fuego, como cenicero 
Veo veo, son las gafas yo creo 
Sin subtitulos te leo, feo feo 
Yo soy mudo sordo y ciego 
El Subestimado, judiado odiado 
El mas imitado, mas comparado 
El Underdog hasta que muera 
Como pichirea, tegocaldero y sobra candela 

Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas 
Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demas 
Como yo veo las cosas, como yo veo las cosas 
Como yo veo las cosas, yo las veo diferente a los demas

Pero si cocina como camina que me de la oferta agrandá
Dale, ma', no seas tan afrenta
Mira que Dios te multiplica to' lo que tu das
Yo se que tu eres independiente, na' de interesa
Que te importa tres carajos que yo cante rap
Que sea un matón, bichote, que venda crack
O que sea un riquitillo de la alta sociedad
Mami, ellos dicen que estoy loco
Y yo les digo que loco es que es
Que gaste $100 y por poco que casi te toco
Pero que no te toque

Ella no quiere novio, quiere vacilar na' mas
No quiere a nadie que le este diciendo na'
Ningún bobo que le venga hablando pendeja'
Ella no tiene que explicarle a nadie pa' donde va
No quiere novio, quiere vacilar na' mas
No quiere a nadie que le este diciendo na'
Ningún bobo que le venga hablando pendeja'
Ella no tiene que explicarle a nadie pa' donde va

Ella no quiere novio dice
Pero le deje el celular
Por si acaso quiere bellaquear que me avise
Le compre unos chocolates Hershey Kisses
Que el horóscopo decía
Que era un buen día pa' tratar de ser felices
Y si tu quieres no hacemos jevos
Y voy a conocer a tu viejo
""Buenas noches, mucho gusto, yo soy Ñejo""
Pero tú con esa pichaera, uniformá de pelotera
Me tiene en una lista de espera
Cuerpo de botella
Y una estrella que bajo del cielo fugá
Bonita por alante y preciosa por detrás
Dime que tengo que hacer pa' que te vayas conmigo
Dale, apréndete el camino pa' donde yo vivo
La tarjeta de los cupones la cambie por efectivo
La última parada es en la calle Méndez Vigo
Ponce, Puerto Rico 00731
Aire, televisión, mas incluye desayuno

Ella no quiere novio, quiere vacilar na' mas
No quiere a nadie que le este diciendo na'

Tego Calderón,"Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres 
Prenden cuatro velas y se las ponen por los rincones 
Compran de esos iibros que les llaman de colecciones 
Van a la cocina y allí les prestan sus oraciones 

Que será, que será lo que tienen unas pero no otras 
Que un día te levantas y se te meten por dentro corriendo por toa' 
las venas 
No sé desde cuando pero ella me va buscando, me va encontrando y me 
va gustando
Es que me tiene mareao', divagando, borracho

Dime que me has hecho vida mía 
Porque ésto a mi me huele a brujería 

Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres

Dile 
Viento va, Viento va

Algunas lo dan todo otras no dan nada
Unas se quitan la ropa y otras no le hace falta 
Lo cierto es que cuando dicen que un hombre es suyo 
El hombre es suyo 
Y aun mas cierto es que estoy aquí buscándola, deseándola, pidiéndola 
Inventandola en mis lamentos 
Que será lo que me has hecho nena

Dime que me has hecho vida mía 
Dime qué, dime qué
Porque ésto más que amor ya es brujería 
Porqué tu me haces esto mija, porqué? 

Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres

Te tienen que haber dao' agua 'e fregao' mi socio 
No era destila', era de pozo
Que como fué? No te rompa el coco 
Los trabajos malos con fé los destrozo 
Sus porquerías se las revocamos 
Si hay que perdonar perdonamos, que carajo 
Papá creo un día despues del otro 
Pa' gente como nosotros 
Bota el golpe sin ponerse torpe 
En este mundo de cemento hay monte 
de sobra. Verde esperanza y por lejos que esté se alcanza 
Los ciegos sin anteojos ven todo 
lo que no sirve le dan de codo 
El amor es como lotería 
Gana el que tiene suerte no el que merecía 

Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres 
Prenden cuatro velas y se las ponen por los rincones 
Prenden cuatro velas y se ponen a
Compran de esos libros que les llaman de colecciones 
Compran libros de trucos, de cosas, de legiones 
Van a la cocina y allí les prestan sus oraciones 
¿Que fué? 

Ay, mujeres quieren a los hombres 
Hay mujeres y hay mujeres! 
Prenden cuatro velas 
Hay que tener cuidado con lo que comes 
Hechizos te ponen
Cuando las mujeres 
Que prendan velas por montones 
que yo tengo el que me proteje 
que me quiere, me cuida 
Cuando las mujeres 
prenden cuatro velas y te las ponen por los rincones
Ten cuidao' con lo que comes Tommy",El Trabajito,2008
Tego Calderón,"Hoy les dire mi realidad
Y asi no se pregunten más
Porque ya no me ven con hombres tan apuestos
Toda mi vida lo intente
Pero al final todo era igual
Nunca encontraba lo que yo buscaba dentro
Reconoci que en los ojos no se llena el alma
Que nadie se le compara a quien hoy me acompaña
Él es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Asi esta mija, ninguno de ellos se busca andar conmigo
""Anda conmigo""
Digan lo que digan yo soy el elejido-
Quien pensaria que detras
De sus palabras iba a estar
Esa creación del cielo que hoy toma mi mano
Algunas le dijeron no por eso cuando dije si me ha sido fiel 
Y mucho mas que lo soñado yo se muy bien que este amor durará 
Para siempre creo que nunca yo fui tan feliz
Él es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Con su pelo tan desaliñado con su andar despreocupado 
Lo que nunca habia buscado él es el mismo que hoy anda conmigo
Anda conmigo
Oye niña que probaste y me pelaste con el que nunca vaya de pelo lacio
Que lo nuestro es todo aca no en el gimnasio, y que la ceja no me saco
Que ando contigo porque tu quisiste estar conmigo esto no le 
Agrada ni a tus enemigos pararte en seco pocas hacen eso por 
Eso ná más te respeto, cuando uno cree se ve que no es como
Parece y lo que aprendiste son estupideses que los prejuicios
Son pá los que se fijan por eso soy el feo de la nena linda
El es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
Ese soy yo tego calderon
Es el feo de la calle
Ven a bailarte
El es el feo de la calle
Con su estilo funky
La legacia ves
Es el feo de la calle con su estilo funky

Tego Calderón,"Lately you’ve been a little unsure
Between the shows and the tours
I’m barely home anymore
Lady, you gotta trust that i’m yours
I’d give it all up and more
And Imma tell you again
If you didn’t know before

Tu lloras lloras lloras, tantas madrugadas
Te he dicho que te amo y no crees mis palabras
Tu juicio miente, tu instinto falla
Soy un hombre nuevo, no temas de nada
Tu lloras lloras lloras, tu dudas de mi
Quizás por mi pasado, ya no soy así
Lo mejor de mi pasado fue conocerte a ti

Baby
The number you used to find
The panties in the truck I would hide
Y un chupón en el cuello
Con excusas baratas that’s all in my past
Shady, that’s who I used to be
Buy baby that’s not me
Not anymore
Let me tell you again If you didn’t know before

Tu lloras lloras lloras, tantas madrugadas
Te he dicho que te amo y no crees mis palabras
Tu juicio miente, tu instinto falla
Soy un hombre nuevo, no temas de nada
Tu lloras lloras lloras, tu dudas de mi
Quizás por mi pasado, ya no soy así
Lo mejor de mi pasado fue conocerte a ti, a ti

Todo hombre que se sienta orgulloso
De encontrar amor
Que agarre a su pareja y sin pena griten woo

And all my ladies that made playas fall in love
And took control (control)
The ones who use to cry
But don’t cry anymore, Scream woo

Tu lloras lloras lloras, tantas madrugadas
Te he dicho que te amo y no crees mis palabras
Tu juicio miente, tu instinto falla
Soy un hombre nuevo, no temas de nada
Tu lloras lloras lloras tu dudas de mi
Quizás por mi pasado, ya no soy así
Lo mejor de mi pasado fue conocerte a ti

Hey, hey, hey, oye
You’re the only one, my babies mom
Yo fui un patán, si, more than once
Me estoy portando bien, no me creen el cuento
No no, cuando viajo pa’ conciertos
Yo sé nada que na', pero no la culpo
Si hubiera sido al revés ni estaríamos juntos
Hablando claro sin pelos en la lengua
Estoy pidiendo pa’ parar esta guerra (Dile, dile, dile)
Tu instinto de mujer was on point before (right on)
But right now mami, you’re way off
After every show el negro, como Sylvester Stallone
Oye jeje, loco tu get home
Me invideras tu y mi nene
Ya no estoy pal party (no estoy pa’ party)
Aunque me encantan las mujeres
Solo me detiene pensar que me dejes
Se acaban y no las pruebo, chamacas cooperen, cooperen

Tu lloras lloras lloras, tantas madrugadas (aja)
Te he dicho que te amo y no crees mis palabras (¿qué fue?)
Tu juicio miente, tu instinto falla
Soy un hombre nuevo, no temas de nada (Soy un hombre nuevo)
Tu lloras lloras lloras tu dudas de mi
Quizás por mi pasado, Ya no soy así
Lo mejor de mi pasado fue conocerte a ti, a ti",Trust [*],2014

Que cuando escucha reggaeton, ella prende el motor
Perreo sensualidad sin pudor
La disco esta llena, por el calor sale el vapor
No pares de sacudir

Con solo una mirada me empieza a seducir
Me pega a la esquina y yo me quiero morir

Y si me copian la frecuencia
Júntense que al party llegamos sin clemencia
Nenas se apuntan pal estado de emergencia
Y prepararon toas el booty pa moverlo con demencia
Fueron con choque a tu bloque

Teh Tarik Crew,"(Chorus)
It's all about
The phat and perfect family
We make 'em jazzy
And make 'em parlez all the way
The kind of flows
That shake the hottest towns
We make the hottest sounds
And make the parties bounce

Joe&Phlowtron:
It's the infamous freak
And venomous Jizzow
We hold on
With Supafreak and AtomdaBomb
From Phlowtron
This how we do(this is how we do)
Yo,you best listen proper
On a Phat fam trip
With more kicks
Than foot locker
Your boots been rocking
Keeping it up in this mother
Your style's fake
Like it get sarcasm
Every time you knock her
It's urgent for us to be
Submerging from the underworld
We the chosen ones
You don't believe me
Ask the oracle
Read the chironicles of this
Mad rapper slash whoever
Yo we fam?
Yeah we fam
And keep it
Through this endeavour
This mission we ain't preaching
Just need to split some knowledge
Time to put fake noise
Wise in cold storage
We beyond
It's your time
You think you Hispanic
We think you charlatanic
Just chilling don't panic
Ain't no beef in this brother
The styles remain unheard of
Too Phat and Phlowtron
We taking this further

Repeat chorus[2x]

Malique & Phlowtron:
Yo what's your name(Malique)
And what you representing
Too Phat
I heard a lot of songs
The filling you now
I'd say now it's too bad
It's poetry of myself
And those cast that filling me
Like all your fans
No doubt
What you seem to hear
Squealing me
The stress is killing me
But remain the trendsetter
Like when push comes
To hold ups jeans
You should know better
A 13th letter song
She never yawn
To remind you of my name
Every time you be counting
One,two
No question
I got some assumption
Now an era of submission
On this repercussion
I superscript patch on
Equipped and all ready
Then everybody best believe
That you fly
Like I was R.Kelly
Yeah,I think this someâ??really
It's revolutionary
When we blow up spots
You know my style unheard of
It's Phat Fam
Representing on the slow song
Malique locking the down with me
(Who?)
Carleed from Phlowtron

Repeat Chorus[2x]

Muchachaz:
Norrenâ??I rock steady
My raps are not petty
My texts are locked fatty
Yo Ren your shots ready?
Oh yeah I'm ready
Step back and make way for Renita
One in the million stunner
I'm the femme de Nikita
1,2 Dahlia's coming for you
The dance queen,facinating

Fantastic causes
Phat Family no pauses
We're pushing courses

M.O.B:
Ohhhh nooooâ?¦(No,No,No)
You better be ready for now
Coz MOB's coming for ya
Holla at me
If you wanna battle(battle)

As I running into the club
Give it up just stop
Don't think you're on top
Gotta be the one
Who's making it pop
Telling you a bit about
That's how we roll

Gotta stick to the plan
Caught a chick do that thang
Better keep to my slang
Got a gig to be hang
Rather be with my friends
Got you sick when I sang
Would you stick to my fang
Bet you flip I say so

Better be prepared
With a red carpet
Gotta move my steps
Taking off your hat
Show me some respect
Doing as I said
Everything's the fact
Flip that and so we roll

the Tarik Crew:
Save the best for last
Coming through
The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines
That we be quoting
Exploding
We leave the venue
With the stage broken
That no sugar coating
Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow
The rhyming prose
With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

Tei Shi,"I get a little bit dizzy
I jump through hoops and climb trees
Cover my toxic loving
All in the saddling fear, oh
That you see me, see me
See me, see me

Why would I ever hurt him? 
I care about the way you see me
I wanna wake you from this
I'll fight you without the fear, oh
If you'll just go see me, see me
See me, see me, see me

You never look at your surroundings 
You only think I need my exchange
But I'll be by the trees
And I grow while no one touches
And I unravel your mistakes
If you'd just go see me, see me

I get a little bit dizzy
I jump through hoops and climb trees
Cover my toxic loving
All in the saddling fear, oh

You never look at your surroundings

Tei Shi,"Baby, why you tryna' blame me?
Even though I'm dryin' up on patience
You know I'm the same me, maybe
We could try doin' somethin' fun tonight
We both know we're runnin' out of secrets
Only in the daylight, we thrive

Listen here (Oh, baby love)
If you don't look at me, I'll disappear (I'm done here)
We can end this now with a full house
Take a bow and shed a single tear, oh dear
But hold me close, and we can dance to the violence
Let me know, I wanna go down in silence

It's not personal (Oh, baby love)
Just wish I could reverse it all (Can't have it all)
Give me something good and send a wink my way
If it hurts at all, I'll stop the fall
Sit tight (Oh, baby love)
And dream about me all night (I don't wanna go)
Take a dive and swim inside our memories
Everything is alright, oh my

If you're in there
Just know that I am not scared (Don't save me, love)
I'll take you by the shoulders
Squeeze them tight and shake you
'Til I wake you, hey you (Hey! Hey!)

To lose you (Oh, baby love)
Is something I refuse to do
If everything's a choice in life just like they say
Well then I choose you, doot-doot
Hold me close, and we can dance with the violence
Let me know, I wanna go down in silence, silence

Go down, ah, ah
And we can dance to the violence (ahh)
