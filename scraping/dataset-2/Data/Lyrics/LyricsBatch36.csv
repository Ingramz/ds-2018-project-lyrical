Charles Kimbrough,"You're a mean one, Mr Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch!
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul
Mr. Grinch!
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch!
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile
Mr. Grinch!
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch!
You're a nasty, wasty skunk!
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk
Mr. Grinch!
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots
Mr. Grinch!
Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch!
With a nauseous super naus!
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss
Mr. Grinch!
You're a three-decker sauerkraut 
And toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch",1996
Charles Kimbrough,"Paris, the city of lovers
Is glowing this evening
True, that's because it's on fire
But still, there's l'amour
Somewhere out there in the night
Her heart is also alight
And I know the guy she just might
Be burning for

A guy like you
She's never known, kid
A guy like you
A girl does not meet every day
You've got a look
That's all your own, kid
Could there be two?

Like you?
No way!

Those other guys
That she could dangle
All look the same
From every boring point of view
You're a surprise
From every angle
Mon Dieu above
She's gotta love
A guy like you

A guy like you
Gets extra credit
Because it's true
You've got a certain something more
You're aces, kid
You see that face
You don't forget it
Want something new?
That's you
For sure!
We all have gaped
At some Adonis
But then we crave a meal
More nourishing to chew
And since you've shaped
Like a croissant is
No question of
She's gotta love
A guy like you!

Call me a hopeless romantic
But Quasi, I feel it
She wants you so
Any moment she'll walk through that door
For

A guy so swell
With all you bring her
A fool could tell
It's why she fell
For you-know-who
You ring the bell
You're the bell ringer!
When she wants oo-la-la
Then she wants you la-la
She will discover, guy
You're one heckuva guy
Who wouldn't love a guy
Like you?

You got a lot
The rest have not
She's gotta love a guy like you!",A Guy Like You [From the Hunchback of Notre Dame],1997

This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate

Charles La Vere,"Each time I see a crowd of people,
Just like a fool I stop and stare,
It's really not the proper thing to do,
But maybe you'll be there.

I go out walking after midnight,
Along the lonely thoroughfare,
It's not the time or place to look for you,
But maybe you'll be there.

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss,
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair;
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door,
And maybe you'll be there",Maybe You'll Be There,1997
Charles Larkey,"I only wanted to play
I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold

He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold

I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

So be true to your good man 
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold
You just might get-a left now out in the cold

Don't let yourself get left now out in the cold

Il fait du bon pain, du pain si fin que j'ai faim

Comme un ange bleu portant ses lettres au bon dieu
Miracle sans nom à la station javelle
On voit le métro qui sort de son tunnel
Grisé de soleil, de chansons et de fleurs
Il court vers le bois, il court à toute vapeur

Y'a d'la joie! La tour eiffel part en ballade
Comme une folle, elle saute la seine à pieds joints
Puis elle dit ""tant pis pour moi si j'suis malade
J'm'embêtais tout' seule dans mon coin ""

Y'a d'la joie! Le percepteur met sa jaquette
Plie boutique et dit d'un air très doux, très doux
""Bien l'bonjour pour aujourd'hui fini la quête
Gardez tout messieurs, gardez tout""

Mais voilà qu'soudain je m'éveille dans mon lit
Donc, j'avais rêvé, oui car le ciel est gris
Il faut se lever, se laver, se vêtir
Et ne plus chanter si l'on n'a plus rien à dire
Mais je crois pourtant que ce rêve a du bon
Car il m'a permis de faire une chanson

Voyez sa sœur Annie qui se met de la poudre

En ascenseur sa sœur Annie s'en va au bal

Vous êtes bien plus jolie qu'Anna
Anna je vous aime beaucoup plus qu'Annie

Vous avez des yeux bleus qu'Anna n'a

Je préfère vos jolis yeux gris

Le jour béni
Où je vous vis

Vous avez séduit un maharajah
Anna
Eh bien vous n'avez séduit que moi

Tandis qu'Anna dans sa maison fait la lessive
Dans les salons sa sœur Annie fait la lascive

Cette poitrine m'a tout l'air d'une vitrine

Tous vos amis font du cinéma

Je suis vraiment votre seul ami

Il ne faut pas envier sa vie
Rajah je préfère aux trésors d'un jour
Un bel amour
Qui dure toujours

Vous sortez en robe d'apparat
Anna
Vous restez toujours seule à Paris.

Un jour la pauvre Annie vient frapper à ma porte
Elle a des yeux qui font des plis l'air d'une morte
Le maharajah vient de partir pour Singapour
En emportant ses bijoux faux comme son amour

Annie
Vous vous êtes jetée dans mes bras

Tous trois nous avons pleuré sans bruit

Vous êtes restée trois jours dans le coma

Et moi qui ne suis pas un maharajah

Charles Lloyd,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Charles Lloyd,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Is the candle worth the flame?

Change your ways and repent,

Charles Manson,"Sick city, yeah, restless people
From the sick city burnt their houses down
To make the sky look pretty
What can I do, I'm just a person
This is the line we always seem to hear
You just sit, things get worse
And watch TV and drink your beer
Walking all alone
Not going anywhere
Nobody seemed to care
Restless as the wind
This town is killing me
Got to put an end to this restless misery
I'm just one of those restless people
Can never seem to be satisfied
With living in this sick old sick old
Sick city
It may be too late for me to say goodbye
And I might be too late
To watch this sick old city die
Going on the road
Yeah I'm gonna try
To say sick city so long farewell
And die

Charles Manson,"There's a time for living
Time keeps on flying
Think you're loving baby
But all your doing is crying

Can you feel
Are those feelings real
Look at your game, girl
Look at your game, girl

What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game

The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say loves' not enough
it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies
but you're only fooling you

Can't you feel
All those feelings ain't real

Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying",Look at Your Game Girl,2003

Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

To you
I must be sure

That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry

Charles Mingus,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Charles Mingus,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [Live],1990
Charles Mingus,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1993

Charles Mingus,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying

Charles Mingus,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Charles Mingus,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2007

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

As I'll probably miss a bar,

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

And for laying firm hold of the possibilities for good in me
Why do I love you I love you for closing your eyes to the dischords
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy
You have done it without a word without a touch without a sign
You have done it just by being yourself and after all perhaps that's what love means",Why Do I Love You? [Instrumental],1997

All her lovely companions are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?

Charles Rutherford,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside

Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go

This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

So how can I forget you?

Without a love of my own

I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

The earth is a-glow
And to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love.

Maybe it's more than sight of the night,
In a light too lovely for words. 

Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue.
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Au Grand Café vous entrez par hasard
Tout ébloui par les lumières du boul'vard
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous avez bu, quelle soif indomptable
De beaux visages fardés vous disaient bonsoir
Et la caissière se levait pour mieux vous voir
Vous étiez beau vous étiez bien coiffé
Vous avez fait beaucoup d'effet
Beaucoup d'effet au Grand Café.

Comme on croyait que vous étiez voyageur
Vous avez dit des histoires d'un ton blagueur
Bien installé devant la grande table
On écoutait cet homme intarissable
Tous les garçons jonglaient avec Paris-Soir
Et la caissière pleurait au fond d'son tiroir
Elle vous aimait, elle les aurait griffés
Tous ces gueulards, ces assoiffés
Ces assoiffés du Grand Café.

Par terre on avait mis de la sciure de bois
Pour que les cracheurs crachassent comme il se doit
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous invitiez des Ducs, des Connétables
Quand on vous présenta, soudain, l'addition
Vous avez déclaré : Moi, j'ai pas un rond.
Cette phrase-là produit un gros effet
On confisqua tous vos effets

	1

Aux environs des belles années mille neuf cent dix
Lorsque le monde découvrait l'automobile
Une pauvre femme abandonnée avec ses fils
Par son mari qui s'était enfui à la ville
Dans une superbe Panhard et Levassor
Qu'il conduisait en plein essor
Lui écrivait ces mots d'espoir
En pensant que peut-être un soir
Il reviendrait tout comme avant
Au lieu de partir dans le vent

Refrain

Je t'attendrai à la porte du garage
Tu paraîtras dans ta superbe auto
Il fera nuit mais avec l'éclairage
On pourra voir jusqu'au flanc du coteau
Nous partirons sur la route de Narbonne

Toute la nuit le moteur vrombira
Et nous verrons les tours de Carcassonne
Se profiler à l'horizon de Barbeira
Le lendemain toutes ces randonnées
Nous conduiront peut-être à Montauban
Et pour finir cette belle journée
Nous irons nous asseoir sur un banc

L'époux volage hélas ne revint pas si tôt
Escamoté par son nuage de poussière
Courant partout : Nice-Paris, Paris-Bordeaux
Sans se soucier de sa famille dans l'ornière
Il courut ainsi pendant plus de quarante ans
Et puis un jour, tout repentant
Il revint voir sa belle d'antan
Qui avait appris à ses enfants
Ce refrain que les larmes aux yeux
Ils répétaient aux deux bons vieux

Refrain

Ah quel bonheur à la porte du garage
Quand tu parus dans ta superbe auto
Il faisait nuit mais avec l'éclairage
On pouvait voir jusqu'au flanc du coteau
Demain, demain sur la route de Narbonne
Tout comme jadis heureux tu conduiras
Et nous verrons les tours de Carcassonne
Se profiler à l'horizon de Barbeira

Et pour fêter ce retour du passé

Mon gentil p'tit kangourou
Aux yeux verts au poil roux
On t'aimait ici beaucoup
On t'avait rapporté
Du pays des grands étés
D'Australie dans un lit
Un petit lit de paille bien joli.

Kangourou, kangourou
Les premiers jours furent si doux
Tu sautais comme un fou
Gambadant un peu partout
Sous les arbres, dans leurs fleurs
Tu faisais le joli cœur
Les voisins sans courroux
Disaient : ""Qu'il est gentil, ce kangourou.""

Tu grandis, tu grandis
Le jardin devint trop p'tit
A la fin rassasié
De jouer à saute-rosier
Saute-lilas, saute-gazon
Un beau jour tu fis un bond
Et franchit, c'est malin
Le mur de la maison de Saint-Paulin.

Un gendarme qui passait
S'écria : ""Mais qu'est-ce que c'est
Que ce gros lapin d'choux
Qui saute le mur de chez vous ?""
Je lui dis : ""Ce lapin,
M'sieur l'gendarm' c'est un copain.""
Sans m'entendre, il t'emmène
Pour t'enfermer au Zoo de Vincennes.

Nous venions le jeudi
T'apporter des fruits confits
Tristement tu regardais
Les badauds qui te badaient
Et ton exil semblait dire
Est-ce bien vrai ou est-ce pour rire
Ou pour faire une chanson
Que tu m'as fait jeter dans cette prison.

Vint l'automne le temps froid
Et je compris ce jour ma foi
En venant un jeudi
Que tu allais mourir d'ennui
J'eus alors du chagrin
De t'avoir ramené de si loin
Sans savoir que ton bonheur
C'était de vivre du pays de ton cœur.

Kangourou, kangourou
Tu partis, gentil comme tout,
Pour des lieux merveilleux
Où l'on voit passer l'Bon Dieu
Mais parfois quand l'soleil
Brise de ses rayons vermeils
La pluie fine du mois d'août
Je crois te voir là-haut mon kangourou.

Librement, librement
Tu gambades au firmament
Sur de beaux nuages perché
Tu t'amuses à saute-clocher
Saute le toit d'la maison
Saute les vers de ma chanson
Loin des cages, des verrous
Et sans raucune pour moi kangourou.",Kangourou,

Et comme il se croyait loup d'mer
Il jurait et crachait à table
Tout en mâchonnant un mégot
Il y allait de son bavardage
Il ne parlait que de cargos
De tempêtes et d'abordages
Mais les p'tits enfants pas dupés
Montrant un tableau qui s'effrite
S'écriaient ""Grand-père, ce beau pré""
""C'est-y la mer ou Maisons-Laffitte!""

Vous nous menez en bateau c'est normal
Mais vous n'êtes pas amiral

Jamais vous ne fûtes corsaire
Et vous n'avez pas connu de mal de mer
Que lorsque vous montiez Prosper

Charles Trénet,"Nous sommes allongés
Sur l'herbe de l'été.
Il est tard.
On entend chanter
Des amoureux et des oiseaux.

On entend chuchoter
Le vent dans la campagne.
On entend chanter la montagne.

J'ai ta main dans ma main.
Je joue avec tes doigts.
J'ai mes yeux dans tes yeux
Et partout, l'on ne voit

Que la nuit, belle nuit, que le ciel merveilleux,
Tout fleuri, palpitant, tendre et mystérieux.

Viens plus près, mon amour,
Ton cœur contre mon cœur
Et dis-moi qu'il n'est pas de plus charmant bonheur
Que ces yeux dans le ciel, que ce ciel dans tes yeux,
Que ta main qui joue avec ma main.

Je ne te connais pas.
Tu ne sais rien de moi.
Nous ne sommes que deux vagabonds,
Fille des bois, mauvais garçon.

Ta robe est déchirée.
Je n'ai plus de maison.
Je n'ai plus que la belle saison

Et ta main dans ma main
Qui joue avec mes doigts.
J'ai mes yeux dans tes yeux
Et partout, l'on ne voit

Que la nuit, belle nuit, que le ciel merveilleux,
Tout fleuri, palpitant, tendre et mystérieux.

Viens plus près, mon amour,
Ton cœur contre mon cœur
Et dis-moi qu'il n'est pas de plus charmant bonheur.

Charles Trénet,"J’me souviens d’un coin de rue 
Aujourd’hui disparu 
Mon enfance jouait par là 
Je me souviens de cela 
Il y avait une palissade 
Un taillis d’embuscades 
Les voyous de mon quartier 
Venaient s’y batailler 

A présent, il y a un café 
Un comptoir flambant qui fait d’ l’effet 
Une fleuriste qui vend ses fleurs aux amants 
Et même aux enterrements 

Je revois mon coin de rue 
Aujourd’hui disparu 
Je me souviens d’un triste soir 
Où le cœur sans espoir 
Je pleurais en attendant 
Un amour de quinze ans 
Un amour qui fut perdu 
Juste à ce coin de rue 

Et depuis, j’ai beaucoup voyagé 
Trop souvent en pays étrangers 
Mondes neufs, constructions ou démolitions 
Vous m’ donnez des visions 

Je crois voir mon coin de rue 
Et soudain apparus 
Je retrouve ma palissade 
Mes copains, mes glissades 
Mon muguet de deux sous du printemps 
Mes quinze ans, mes vingt ans 
Tout c’ qui fut et qui n’est plus 
Tout mon vieux coin de rue",Coin de Rue,1994
Charles Trénet,"C'est un jardin extraordinaire:
Il y a des canards qui parlent anglais.
Je leur donne du pain, ils remuent leur derrière
En me disant ""Thank you very much, Monsieur Trenet"".
On y voit aussi des statues
Qui se tiennent tranquilles tout le jour, dit-on
Mais moi, je sais que, dès la nuit venue,
Elles s'en vont danser sur le gazon.
Papa, c'est un jardin extraordinaire
Il y a des oiseaux qui tiennent un buffet.
Ils vendent du grain, des petits morceaux de gruyère.
Comme clients ils ont Monsieur le maire et le Sous-Préfet.

Il fallait bien trouver, dans cette grande ville maussade
Où les touristes s'ennuient au fond de leurs autocars,
Il fallait bien trouver un lieu pour la promenade.
J'avoue que ce samedi-là je suis entré par hasard
Dans, dans, dans

Un jardin extraordinaire,
Loin des noirs buildings et des passages cloutés.
Y avait un bal que donnaient des primevères.
Dans un coin de verdure, les petites grenouilles chantaient
Une chanson pour saluer la lune.
Dès que celle-ci parut, toute rose d'émotion,
Elles entonnèrent, je crois, la valse brune.
Une vieille chouette me dit: ""Quelle distraction!""
Maman, dans ce jardin extraordinaire,
Je vis soudain passer la plus belle des filles.
Elle vint près de moi, et là me dit sans manières:
""Vous me plaisez beaucoup, j'aime les hommes dont les yeux brillent!""

Il fallait bien trouver, dans cette grande ville perverse,
Une gentille amourette, un petit flirt de vingt ans
Qui me fasse oublier que l'amour est un commerce
Dans les bars de la cité,
Oui, mais oui mais pas dans
Dans, dans, dans

Mon jardin extraordinaire.
Un ange du Bizarre, un agent nous dit
""Étendez-vous sur la verte bruyère,
Je vous jouerai du luth pendant que vous serez réunis.""
Cet agent était un grand poète
Mais nous préférions, Artémise et moi,
La douceur d'une couchette secrète
Qu'elle me fit découvrir au fond du bois.
Pour ceux qui veulent savoir où le jardin se trouve,
Il est, vous le voyez, au cœur de ma chanson.
J'y vole parfois quand un chagrin m'éprouve.
Il suffit pour ça d'un peu d'imagination!
Il suffit pour ça d'un peu d'imagination!
Il suffit pour ça d'un peu d'imagination!",Le Jardin Extraordinaire,1994

Connaissez-vous la Martinique ?
Connais-tu là-bas le Bango ?
Dès qu'il entend jolie musique
Le voilà debout tout de go
Pour danser avec demoiselle,
Ah, c'est un galant damoiseau,
Demoiselle, tu as des ailes,
Quand tu fais Biguine à Bango…

Refrain

Mami, Mami,
Biguine à Bango
Mami, Mami,
Biguine à Bango !
La nuit à Bango !

La nuit et le jour on ne pense
Qu'à danser Biguine à Bango,
Jeunes filles vont dans la danse,
Les mamis attendent là-haut.
En buvant avec les nourrices
Elles chantent sous leurs chapeaux :
« Mami, Mami, c'est un délice,
Quand on fait Biguine à Bango. » (Refrain)

Le mariage c'est une fête
Où l'on boit du lait de coco
Et lorsque la nuit est complète,
Papi, mami, s'en vont bientôt.
Alors tous deux vite on commence
Les caresses dans le dodo,
On recule et puis on avance,
Et puis c'est… Biguine à Bango ! (Refrain)

Bango, Bango a des p'tits frères
Des p'tit's sœurs qui dans'nt à Paris
À Paris aussi on sait faire

Une chanson qu'on fredonne, c'est fleur bleue
Un jeune amour qui se donne, deux grands yeux qui s'abandonnent
C'est fleur bleue

On envoie des pneumatiques à fleur bleue
Les dimanches sont poétiques, tous fleur bleue
On se met du cosmétique dans les cheveux
Oui parbleu, pour fleur bleue
On jure que l'on s'adore tous les deux
Et l'on jurerait encore si fleur bleue

Oui à jamais disparue sans adieux
Et je suis seul dans la rue larmes aux yeux

Non ce n'est pas elle, quel drame! C'est une assez grosse dame
Pas fleur bleue

Alors le printemps l'automne sans fleur bleue
Coulent des jours monotones ciel pluvieux
Et cet air que je fredonne sans fleur bleue
Devient vieux, ennuyeux

On voit le métro qui sort de son tunnel
Grisé de soleil, de chansons et de fleurs
Il court vers le bois, il court à toute vapeur

Comme une folle, elle saute la seine à pieds joints

Y'a des chiens-loups dans les coins noirs
Ils sont tous fous quand vient le soir
Leurs yeux scintillent dans la nuit
Quand tous les chats sont gris

Ils sont heureux quand il fait froid
Quand la neige bleue blanchit le toit
Quand le vent qui siffle dehors
Les fait hurler à la mort

Des traquenards sont organisés
Bien des chasses-croisés
Car les chiens cachés dans leur coins
Font croire après qu'ils sont loin

Ils ont des larmes de crocodile
Et des armes bien plus subtiles
Quand ils rôdent poil à l'envers

Car c'est l'heure où parfois on meurt
Qu'on s'appelle Firmin, Jacques ou Georges

Ils ont même mangé son chapeau
Qu'ils prenaient pour de la peau

Que je change de milieu

Ce soir c'est une chanson d'automne
Dans la maison qui frissonne
Et je pense aux jours lointains

Que reste-t-il de nos amours
Que reste-t-il de ces beaux jours
Une photo, vieille photo
De ma jeunesse
Que reste-t-il des billets doux
Des mois d'avril, des rendez-vous
Un souvenir qui me poursuit
Sans cesse

Bonheur fané, cheveux au vent
Baisers volés, rêves mouvants
Que reste-t-il de tout cela
Dites-le-moi
Un petit village, un vieux clocher
Un paysage si bien caché
Et dans un nuage le cher visage
De mon passé

Les mots les mots tendres qu'on murmure
Les caresses les plus pures
Les serments au fond des bois
Les fleurs qu'on retrouve dans un livre
Dont le parfum vous enivre
Se sont envolés pourquoi?

	1

Jadis sous l'soleil des tropiques
Un jeun' Français sous-officier
Rencontra par une nuit magique
Une belle enfant : « Cœur de palmier ».
Il lui dit : « Je t'adore
Mon amour, mon trésor. »
Mais la belle fut rebelle à ses vœux
Et perfide, elle fuit
Un beau jour pour Paris,
C'est d'puis lorsqu'il redit chaque nuit :

1er refrain

Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara,
Pigeon ramier
Tu reviendras.
Ton amoureux
T'attend là-bas,
Bien malheureux
Dans la Casbah.
Le soleil augmente sa fièvre,
Sa soif ardente est de tes lèvres,
Prends en pitié
Son cœur très las.
Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara,
Pigeon ramier
Tu reviendras.
Cœur de palmier
Un jour, c'est lui qui t'aura.

	2

Mais un soir la bataille fait rage,
C'est le baroud dans la Casbah.
Guito n'écoute que son courage,
Car le chagrin l'a mis très bas.
On d'mande un volontaire
Il part vif comm'l'éclair.
Il arrive au bastion d'la Légion.
L'colonel ébloui
Le décor' la même nuit,
C'est alors qu'il chante pour ses amis :

2e refrain

Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara,
Pigeon ramier
Oui c'est pour toi,
Pour te prouver
Tout mon amour,
Que j'ai risqué
Ma vie ce jour.
Mais que m'importent blessures et fièvre
Ce que je veux, ce sont tes lèvres.
J'ai tant d'espoir
De désir fou,
Que pour te voir
Je donn'rai tout,
Car je suis tien,
Mon cœur est lié À toi pour toujours mon bien,
Cœur de palmier.

	3

Mais au cœur de Paris volage,
Cœur de palmier a vite perdu,
Après trois mois d'apprentissage,
Sa jolie mine et sa vertu.
De Pigalle à Clichy,
Dans tout' les boît's de nuit,
Elle rit, puis un soir, à Saint-Louis
On l'emporte, c'est la fin.
Quel tragique destin.
Le docteur dit en prenant sa main :

3e refrain

Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara
Pigeon ramier
Qu'as-tu fait là ?
Ton amoureux
Se meurt là-bas,
Bien malheureux
Dans la Casbah
Il n'a pas pour calmer sa fièvre
L'dernier baiser d'amour d'tes lèvres…
Et séparés
Loin de vos bras
Désespérés

Vers la mort qui vous prendra.",Coeur de Palmier,1998

Je l'sais bien
Je n'irais pas au Ritz

Ici c'est bien plus grand

Travailler, pour être un jour heureux
Et rev'nir, qui sait, le cœur content

Que j'préfère au train qui remonte le temps
La douceur de mon vieux printemps

	J'entends ma mie
Les grands bulldozers
Dans la prairie
Ils donnent un concert
Et leurs chenilles
Qui s'éparpillent
Vont transformer en enfer
Les coins champêtres
Que nous aimons tant,
Le bois de hêtres
La source d'antan
Et la piscine
Qu'on assassine
Nous dit : « Adieu mes enfants »

Dans la poussière,
Spectacle navrant,
On voit des pierres
Qu'un monstre savant,
Triste machine
Courbant l'échine
Choisit et cueille dans le vent
Adieu la vigne
Adieu cerisiers
Qui restez dignes
Comme des fusillés
On vous emporte
La vie est morte
Adieu chemins et sentiers

À coups de marteau,

	1

Il y a des villes tristes
Où les pauvres touristes
Font des nez longs comme ça
D'vant les monuments.
Ils s'ennuient en visite
Et désirent vite vite
Partir pour des lieux plus charmants.
Mais moi qui ne trouve pas les musées amusants
Mais moi qui fus toujours enn'mi des monuments
J'connais une ville charmante, féodale, familière
Qui joint la jeune gaieté au goût des vieilles pierres.

Refrain

Joyeuse cité
Celle de Carcassonne
Hiver comme été
Enfants et grandes personnes
Ils vont danser l'be-bop
Et c'est gentil comme tout
Devant ces vieux murs
Mon cœur en frissonne,
Au lieu des armures
Des airs de jazz résonnent
Ils vont danser l'be-bop et c'est un succès fou.
Dans les donjons, y a des trombones heureux
Qui soufflent des chansons pour les cœurs amoureux
Et jusqu'au fond des vieux mâchicoulis

On entend, jour et nuit,
Des cris, des cris…
Joyeuse cité
Cité de Carcassonne
Hiver comme été,
Enfants et grandes personnes,
Ils vont danser l'be-bop,
Et c'est un succès fou.

Parfois une valse tendre
Le soir se fait entendre
On la danse à trois temps pas pour longtemps.
Le style de cette danse
Malgré son élégance
Déplaît à tous les habitants
Mais moi qui suis comme eux, qui n'aime pas les trois temps
Qui préfère c'est curieux les airs de notre temps
Je trouve à Carcassonne la joie de tout mon être
Et quand je suis là-bas je sens mon cœur renaître.

Au hasard d'un voyage
Un jour j'ai rencontré
Sur un lointain rivage
L'amour que je cherchais
Et j'ai dit à ma belle :
« Je suis ton amoureux,
Ce soir mon cœur t'appelle
Viens, partons tous les deux… »

Refrain

L'amour est un petit bateau
Qui s'en va tout joyeux sur l'onde,
Voguant vers des pays nouveaux
Au hasard de sa course vagabonde,
Bercé par la chanson des flots,
Nos deux cœurs y feront le tour du monde
Tous les deux, rien que nous, c'est mon rêve le plus beau
L'amour est un petit bateau.

Ce fut l'instant suprême,
Le destin merveilleux,
On se disait : « Je t'aime »,
Sous un ciel toujours bleu.
Et des voix nostalgiques
Sous les étoiles d'or,
Pendant les nuits magiques
Nous fredonnaient encor : (Au 1er refrain)

Mais les lointains voyages
Doivent finir un jour.
L'amour y fait naufrage,
Ainsi sombre l'amour.
Un soir j'ai vu des larmes
Au fond de tes grands yeux,
Et j'ai compris : le charme
Était sous d'autres cieux.

Dernier refrain

Adieu notre petit bateau
Qui s'en va tout seul par le monde,
Portant le rêve le plus beau
Au hasard de sa course vagabonde.

Adieu bonheur, beaux jours, souvenirs, tendres bécots,
Adieu notre petit bateau.",Bateau d'Amour,2004

Bergère d'azur, infinie

Voyez
Près des étangs
Ces grands roseaux mouillés
Voyez
Ces oiseaux blancs
Et ces maisons rouillées

Les a bercés
Le long des golfes clairs
Et d'une chanson d'amour
La mer
A bercé mon cœur pour la vie

La mer
Qu'on voit danser
Le long des golfes clairs
A des reflets d'argent

Des reflets changeants
Sous la pluie

La mer
Au ciel d'été confond
Ses blancs moutons
Avec les anges si purs

Charles Trénet,"Chanson pour Noël

Ils sautent et dansent
Les joyeux bergers
Sous le ciel immense
Il peut neiger
Vers l'étoile s'avancent
Des rois étrangers
Ils sautent et dansent
Les p'tits bergers
Les vieux se souviennent
Des anges musiciens
Ah ! vite que reviennent
Les Noëls anciens
Mais les jeunes s'élancent
Ivres de courir
Vers la plaine immense
Dans l'avenir.

La cloche a sonné
L'enfant Jésus est né
La vache et le veau
Lui disent bonjour, bravo !…
Un coq a chanté
L'enfant Jésus est né
L'oiseau l'a répété
Depuis longtemps je l'attendais.

Ils sautent et dansent
Dans la nuit d'Noël
Sur les routes de France
Les anges du ciel
Et chacun s'enchante
De les voir ainsi
Le poète les chante
Les enfants aussi
C'est une jolie ronde
De joie et d'amour
La ronde du monde
Dans son plus beau jour
Sous le ciel immense
Il est revenu
Noël recommence
Bonjour p'tit Jésus.",Chanson pour Noel,2012

Je veux chanter la vie, l'espoir…

C'est le bonheur, la joie de vivre

Il faut cueillir chaque beau jour
	Car deviendra sans retour
Ne pensons qu'à l'amour.
Si ma chanson a su te plaire
Amour, il faut sourire un peu
Un bon sourire et tout s'éclaire

Au Grand Café vous entrez par hasard
Tout ébloui par les lumières du boul'vard
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous avez bu, quelle soif indomptable
De beaux visages fardés vous disaient bonsoir
Et la caissière se levait pour mieux vous voir
Vous étiez beau vous étiez bien coiffé
Vous avez fait beaucoup d'effet
Beaucoup d'effet au Grand Café.

Comme on croyait que vous étiez voyageur
Vous avez dit des histoires d'un ton blagueur
Bien installé devant la grande table
On écoutait cet homme intarissable
Tous les garçons jonglaient avec Paris-Soir
Et la caissière pleurait au fond d'son tiroir
Elle vous aimait, elle les aurait griffés
Tous ces gueulards, ces assoiffés
Ces assoiffés du Grand Café.

Par terre on avait mis de la sciure de bois
Pour que les cracheurs crachassent comme il se doit
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous invitiez des Ducs, des Connétables
Quand on vous présenta, soudain, l'addition
Vous avez déclaré : Moi, j'ai pas un rond.
Cette phrase-là produit un gros effet
On confisqua tous vos effets
Vous étiez fait au Grand Café.

Depuis ce jour, depuis bientôt soixante ans
C'est vous l'chasseur, l'commis de restaurant
Vous essuyez toujours la grande table
C'est pour payer cette soirée lamentable
Ah, vous eussiez mieux fait de rester ailleurs
Que d'entrer dans ce café plein d'manilleurs

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

If not himself, then he has naught

I don't need help from anyone.
I go through my drawer,
And choose what I adore,

Then proudly check the mirror when I'm done.
So what if both my socks are not the same;
I like getting dressed when I can choose.
If one sock is white and red,
And one is blue instead,

My feet will still stay warm inside my shoes.
And when I wear orange pants with my green cap,
You may think they clash with my pink shirt.
But I might have a style,
That helps the world to smile,

And surely you'll agree that cannot hurt.
Oh, I can put my clothes on by myself!

Charley Drayton,"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1992

Note 1: roller, according to Chris Schell ""I believe
Mississippi slang for a car being used to transport a
woman is ""doroller or biscuit roller. Roller
meaning car would seem to me to make more sense in
terms of this song which involves a woman leaving and
in terms of the title which may refer to the year of
the car."" Thanks To Chris Schell;
Note 2: the farm of Will Dockery, in Patton's native
town Dockery, a Delta plantation town;
This is another familiar Delta piece. Robert Johnson
used the same melody in ""If I had Possession Over
Judgment Day"" and ""Traveling Riverside Blues"". It has
also been recorded under the title ""Roll And Tumble
Blues"". Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf have issued
