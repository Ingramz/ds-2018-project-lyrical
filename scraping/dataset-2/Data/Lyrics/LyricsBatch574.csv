Lara & Reyes,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,2000
Lara & Reyes,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,2000
Lara & Reyes,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Lara Fabian,"Plus que tout
C'est comme ça que tu voulais l'aimer
Rien que nous
Tu lui disais pour la faire rêver
Après tout
Lui mentir ne t'as pas servis
Tu es là tout seul le cœur désuni
Pour toujours
Douceur, tendresse elle t'avait juré
Par amour
Elle s'était donnée
Sans détour
Elle voulait t'aimer
Ça te faisait peur
Ces overdoses de bonheur

Dire
Que tu réalises à ton tour
Que vivre sans elle, c'est l'enfer tous les jours
Libre tu te prends à tout détester
Même cette liberté
Tu te sens emprisonné
Dire
Que tu regrettes à n'en crever
C'est pire tu t'accuses d'avoir mal aimé
Dire que tout semblait parfait
Tu voudrais courir, la ratrapper

Dire encore
Que ses yeux désarmants
Vibrent fort
Dans tes rêves noirs et blancs
Vivre alors que tout s'éclaire trop tard
Vivre fort comme s'il restait de l'espoir",Dire,1991
Lara Fabian,"Tu sais plus pourquoi t'es là, si tu ressembles ou pas
T'oublies même de rêver la nuit
Tu téléphones aux hommes qui t'ont chanté la pomme
Tu te prends à envier tes amis
Et tu te demandes ce que tu fous là
Si repeindre ta chambre changerait tout ça

Pourquoi pas l'exotisme? Mets un maillot sympa
Prends le ton air d'actrice en vacances, pourquoi pas?
Pourquoi pas l'exotisme? L'express San Francisco
Ouvre les yeux, pourquoi faner dans ce ghetto
Pourquoi faner, pourquoi faner, pourquoi faner?

Lentement tu désespères, tu te perds dans ce désert
Entre un ordi et l'ordinaire
Tu déchaînes tes colères quand tu te ramasses à terre
La galère n'a rien pour te plaire
Et tu tangues au beau milieu
De cette ville qui flanche, c'est quoi que tu veux?

Pourquoi pas l'exotisme? Mets un maillot sympa
Prends le ton air d'actrice en vacances, pourquoi pas?
Pourquoi pas l'exotisme? L'express à San Francisco
Ouvre les yeux, pourquoi faner dans ce ghetto
Pourquoi faner, pourquoi faner, pourquoi faner?

Oh, mais t'es si belle dans la tête
Même tes yeux sont le reflet d'une vie en fête
Oh, tu peux t'en aller sur une île du Pacifique
Pourquoi pas l'exotisme?
Et tu tangues au beau milieu
De cette ville qui flanche, c'est quoi tu veux?

Pourquoi pas l'exotisme? Mets un maillot sympa
Prends le ton air d'actrice en vacances, pourquoi pas?
Pourquoi pas l'exotisme? L'express San Francisco

Lara Fabian,"Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
On se perd dans ce boulot d'enfer
T'es comme un milliardaire
Elle a pas le temps
Sauf pour ses affaires
On est comme des courants d'air
À rebours le compteur de nos jours
Nous stressa toujours
Tu t'agites, tu cours ou tu flippes
On dit que c'est la vie d'artiste
Mais

Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour

Si on pouvait s'arrêter
On jure qu'on le ferait
Mais au fond de nos sens
Y a la vie qui avance
Les gamins, les vacances
Pourquoi pas tout plaquer

Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour
Qui pense à l'amour, à l'amour

Où va la vie
Y a des moments d'ennui
Où tu te demandes
Si t'as tout compris
Pourquoi on vit
Le cœur en transparence
Comme un oubli
Faut qu'on y pense",Qui Pense À l'Amour?,1991
Lara Fabian,"Petit homme
Petit bonhomme d'aujourd'hui
Tu t'étonnes de cette étrange vie
Pour un homme, un inconnu
Un dieu que t'as jamais vu
On se bat tu te demandes pourquoi
Il suffit d'un éclair
Pour déchaîner le bruit do tonnerre
Il suffit d'un éclair
Pour que coule bien trop de larmes amères
Tous ces canons inutiles
Je te sens tellement fragile
Pourquoi ces éclairs?

Petit gars t'avances pas dans cette vie
Trop petit, l'univers de tes nuits
À l'école on t'apprend l'amour
D'une loi sainte cousue de velours
Pour laquelle tu te battras un jour

Pourquoi ces éclairs?
Et cette envie de vivre qui s'éveille
Pour qui la misère?
Où es-tu dieu le père?

Où es-tu?
Où es-tu?
Où es-tu?",Il  Suffit d'un Éclair,1991
Lara Fabian,"Mon cœur s'est perdu entre le ciel et l'eau
Emporté par le vent chaud
Les reflets du ciel qui dansent sur ma peau
Je dérive sur un bateau
Tout ce temps à vivre à contre-courant
Je t'attends où la mer devient l'océan
Emmène-moi
J'ai besoin de m'envoler
Au loin là-bas
Où l'amour ouvre ses bras
Où nos vies vont voyager

Si j'échoue sur un île perdue sur le rivage
Tu trouveras mon message
Entre l'Équateur et une île tropicale
Nos deux cœurs feront escale
Tout ce temps à vivre à contre-courant
Je t'attends où la mer devient l'océan

Comme un bateau sans ses voiles
Tu vois, je n'arrive pas
Je me perd dans les étoiles
Un jour tu me trouveras

Au loin là-bas
Au loin là-ba",Au Lion Là-Bas,1994
Lara Fabian,"I want believe
That my prayers are being heard
Lately it seems
They have all been wasted words
How many prayers will it take
How many tears must we cry
Till we can walk across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side
I know we could change
The sadness into smiles
If we could all see the world
Through the eyes of a child
How many prayers will it take
How many tears must we cry
Till we can walk across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

If everybody has the same thoughts
And everybody shares the same dream
Can't we get together
And make this world a better place

I had a dream
All our hatred turned into love
And every river of tears
Dried up into dust
Every woman and man
Standing side by side
Then we walked across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

I want believe
That my prayers are being heard
Lately it seems
They have all been wasted words
How many prayers will it take
How many tears must we cry
Till we can walk across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

Can we talk across that bridge of hope
And find peace
Sweet peace
On the other side",Bridge of Hope,1994
Lara Fabian,"Au bout de tout
De ce bleu immense
Au bout de mes joues
Et de ton cœur qui danse
A porté de mains
Et de l'esprit il y a
Plus que notre avenir
A porté du cœur
Il faut partir
A cent mille lieux
De tes yeux si clairs
Il y cent mille feux
Qui nous brûlent les ailes
Je les emmènerai ces yeux
Et pour un peu nous oublierons l'univers
Tu me suivras
Enfin j'espère

Il existe un endroit au bout de la terre
Où je passerai ma vie entière à te plaire
Il existe un endroit où même le doute
Laisse sa place à l'eau qui coule goutte à goutte
Il existe un endroit où même je suppose
Que le temps entre toi et moi marquerait des pauses
Il existe un endroit
Où même le vent s'arrêtera

Dans ce paradis trop petit pour tous
Je fais notre nid
Ne l'ai garnie que de mousse
De brindilles de soleil, de fleurs, de miel
Et puis à ton réveil
Je boirai tes mains et toi ma bouche",Il  Existe un Endroit,1994
Lara Fabian,"Pour toi j'ai déserté la terre
J'ai fait ma frontière
De ton nom et de tes yeux
C'est toi, oui c'est toi seul au monde
Plus jamais personne
Ne me fera vivre à deux
Et pourtant je sais
Que si tu me quittais aujourd'hui même
Autant que je t'aime
Je vivrais

J'irais rencontrer mes larmes
Écarter des flammes
Mélanger ma vie à d'autres vies
Suivie de ton ombre immense
Portant ta présence
Du passé à l'avenir

Et remplie de toi
Avec cette force qui me vient de toi
Si tu t'en allais
Je vivrais

Je vivrais
Comme on vit parce qu'on doit vivre
Oui je vivrais
Libérée sans être libre

Tu vois que sans toi j'existe
A peine un peu triste
Oui sans toi j'existerais

Avec toi pourtant
Si je n'ai que rêvé, si tu m'attends
Au lieu d'exister
Je vivrais
Que tu partes ou non
Je vivrai",Je Vivrai,1994
Lara Fabian,"L'or d'une nuit d'Orient coule à flots
Le parfum des fleurs d'oranger si doux
Le thé au jasmin parfume la peau
Des milliers de diamants roulent
Assise comme une image au bord de l'eau
Sa peau cuivrée attire même les bateaux
Elle est bien trop belle, ces murs bien trop hauts
Même si elle est fidèle à leurs désirs
Elle voudrait au moins choisir
De vivre comme une reine
Ou d'être une sirène
Quand le jour se lève
La nuit tombe à genoux
Le plus fou des rêves brille à son cou
Sur le toit du palais elle cueille des étoiles
Leïla les anges ont des voiles

Elle a appris à parler cette langue
Que seul les sultans ont le droit d'apprendre
Les yeux voilés, le corps à moitié nu
Elle danse et sans aucune retenue
Sourit mais pense à partir
Pour vivre mais comme une reine
Ou être une sirène

Elle se sent comme un oiseau
Partirait mais reviendrait bientôt
Elle pourrait enfin choisir
De vivre plus libre, Leïla
Elle va enfin choisir de vivre comme une reine
Ou être une sirène",Leila,1994
Lara Fabian,"Sèche tes pleurs
Je ne partirai pas
Il m'en faudrait bien plus que ça
Pour tout détruire, anéantir, pas ça
Sèche tes pleurs
Et refais-moi l'amour
Te souviens-tu de cet enfant
Que tu voulais me faire en chantant
Je t'aime encore si fort
Pas sans toi
Je ne la vivrai pas cette vie là
Si tu me reprenais dans tes bras
On pourrait reconstruire tout ça

Pas sans toi
Ce serait comme renier ma vie
Ce serait comme étouffer un cri
Si j'ai tort éloignes-toi
Si tu m'aimes attends moi

Sèche tes pleurs
Le temps nous attendra
Nous nous sommes perdus dans tout ça
Il n'y a plus de raisons d'avoir peur, je crois
Sèche tes pleurs
On est tellement plus fort
Que toutes ces heures, tous ces remords
On s'oubliait, on avait tort
Je t'aime encore si fort

Sèche tes pleurs
Refais-moi ce sourire
Celui qui ne fait pas vieillir
Ni mon âme ni mon corps
Je t'aime encore si fort",Pas Sans Toi,1994
Lara Fabian,"Comment as-tu pu me laisser partir
Pourquoi n'as-tu pas pu me retenir
Comment as-tu pu laisser mes yeux te fuir
Si loin de ton âme et de ta chaleur
Ma vie déséquilibrée sans couleurs
Où sont toutes ces heures
Passées aux bord des mots
De la peau
Si jamais je me perds
Dans d'autres yeux clairs
Si je tombe sans pouvoir
M'arrêter

Ramène-moi vers ton destin
Ramène-moi jusqu'à tes mains
Celles qui m'ont fait mourir un soir
Il n'est jamais trop tard
Emmène-moi comme si c'était
La première fois que tu m'aimais
Je revivrai sans me lasser
Ces moments enlacés

Pourquoi doit-on croire à toutes ces histoires
D'amour qui n'ont pas connu la gloire
Je veux être la dernière à oublier les mots
Qu'il faut
Si jamais tu me vois
Perdue dans d'autres bras
D'un autre que toi
N'y crois pas

Réinvente-moi une histoire
Que je suis seule à croire
Ramène-moi tes délires ce soir",Ramène-Moi,1994
Lara Fabian,"Quelles que soient tes peurs
Quelles que soit la raison de tes pleurs
Quelle que soit la peine
Qui a envahi ton cœur
Quelles que soient les chances
Que tu n'as pu retenir
Quelle que soit l'enfance
Où tu as dû grandir

Saisir le jour
Laisser la vie suivre son cours
Choisir l'amour
Qui t'appelle à ton tour

Si hauts sont les murs
Qui te retiennent et qui t'offensent
Si longues les chaînes
Qui te volent ton existence
Quelle que soit l'absence
Que t'as dû subir
Qu'importe ce silence
A quoi bon te mentir",Saisir le Jour [Carpe Diem],1994
Lara Fabian,"Je le sens
Je le sais
Quand t'as mal à l'autre bout de la terre
Quand tu pleures pendant des heures
Sur mon cœur je pourrais hurler
Le jurer même si je ne vois rien
D'où je suis je sens ton chagrin
Quand je me vois
Sans tes mains
Sans tes bras je ne peux plus respirer
Et j'entends si souvent
Le chant du vent
Qui vient pour me ramener
Vers tes landes sous ton ciel d'Irlande

Quitter ma vie sans préavis
Je le ferais si tu m'aimes

Même si j'ai tort
Tout est plus fort
Que la raison tout est plus fort que ton nom
Que je redis que j'écris sans arrêt
Sur les écrans de ma vie
Et j'espère que chacune des aurores
Que je vois me mènera à ton corps

Je quitterai tout si tu m'aimes

Je sais que je ne me trompe pas
Que quelque part au loin là-bas
Tu penses encore à moi
Tu m'as gardé dans tes bras
Une place, un ébat

Dis-le moi tout bas que tu m'aimes
Que tu m'aimes

Je le sens
Tu penses encore à moi
Je le sais, tu m'as gardé tes bras

Dis-le moi
Que tu m'aimes",Si Tu M'Amies,1994
Lara Fabian,"Si je pouvais
Je te dirais
Reste avec moi
Sur mon cœur et mon âme
Se brise un larme
Je n'ai pas le droit
J'ai envie de te garder là
Te parler tout bas
Quand ma peau nue frémit sous tes doigts
Et je vois dans tes yeux
Que c'est elle que tu veux
Tu t'en vas me laissant seule derrière toi
Tu t'en vas et mon cœur s'envole en éclats
Tu t'en vas en arrachant un bout de moi
Mais tu t'en vas
Retrouver ceux qui t'appartiennent
Retrouver celle qui se fait tienne sous ton toit

Anéantie je te souris
Je ne peux plus parler
Je regarde derrière moi
Et je prends dans mes bras
Le calendrier
Des jours à t'attendre, à mourir
À m'ennuyer de toi
J'aurais envie d'aller tout lui dire
Mais si tu ne me revenais pas
Comment te regarder près de moi

Tu t'en vas en me laissant seule derrière toi
Tu t'en vas et mon cœur s'envole en éclats
Tu t'en vas en arrachant un bout de moi
Mais tu t'en vas
C'est la dernière fois
Je ne suis qu'une deuxième voix
Celle que ton cœur n'entendras pas
Va t'en retrouver celle qui t'aime sous ton toi",Tu T'En Vas,1994
Lara Fabian,"Is that what we've been together much too long 
The answer may not be in black and white 

We're always trying to prove who's right or wrong 
Yet know we're giving up without a fight 

But I know when you're gone 
I'll wish I'd held on 

So, baby, surrender to me 
There'll be no holding back now 
So, baby, surrender to me tonight 

I don't want our love to cause you so much pain 
If this is how it's going to be I'll walk away 

Neither one of us should ever say goodbye 
Let's forget about the past and who's to blame 

'Cause when this is all gone 
We'll wish we'd held on 

So, baby, surrender to me 
There'll be no holding back now 
So, baby, surrender to me tonight 

So, baby, surrender to me 
There'll be no holding back now 
So, baby, surrender to me tonight",Surrender to Me,1997
Lara Fabian,"Les amoureux de l'an deux mille
Cherchent à comprendre
Que seules leurs mains restent mobiles
Pour se défendre
Ils transmettent par ordinateur
Chacun des battements de leur cœur

Les amoureux de l'an deux mille
Viennent juste d'apprendre
Que pour se câbler sur la ville
Faut être Internet tendre
Pour garder l'envie d'exister
Presser sur start et démarrer

Débranchez moi

Lara Fabian,"D'accord, il existait
D'autres façons de se quitter
Quelques éclats de verre
Auraient peut-être pu nous aider
Dans ce silence amer
J'ai décidé de pardonner
Les erreurs qu'on peut faire
A trop s'aimer

D'accord, la petite fille
En moi souvent te réclamait
Presque comme une mère
Tu me bordais, me protégeais
Je t'ai volé ce sang
Qu'on aurait pas dû partager
A bout de mots, de rêves
Je vais crier

Je t'aime, je t'aime
Comme un fou, comme un soldat
Comme une star de cinéma
Je t'aime, je t'aime
Comme un loup, comme un roi
Comme un homme que je ne suis pas
Tu vois, je t'aime comme ça

D'accord je t'ai confié
Tous mes sourires, tous mes secrets
Même ceux dont seul un frère
Est le gardien inavoué

Lara Fabian,"E adesso andate via
Voglio restare solo
Con la malinconia
Volare nel suo cielo
Non chiesi mai chi eri
Perchè segliesti me
Me che fino a ieri
Credevo fossi un re

Perdere l’amore
Quando si fa sera
Quando tra i capelli
Un po’ di argento li colora
Rischi di impazzire
Può scoppiarti il cuore
Perdere una donna
E avere voglia di morire
Lasciami gridare
Rinnegare il cielo
Prendere a sassate tutti i sogni
Ancora in volo
Li farò cadere ad uno ad uno
Spezzerò le ali del destino
E ti avrò vicino

Comunque ti capisco
E ammetto che sbagliavo
Facevo le tue scelte
Chissà che pretendevo
E adesso che rimane
Di tutto il tempo insieme
Un uomo troppo solo
Che ancora ti vuole bene

Perdere l’amore
Quando si fa sera
Quando sopra il viso
C’è una ruga che non c’era
Provi a ragionare
Fai l’indifferente
Fino a che ti accorgi
Che non sei servito a niente
E vorresti urlare
Soffocare il cielo
Sbattere la testa mille volte
Contro il muro
Respirare forte il suo cuscino 
Dire è tutta colpa
Del destino
Se non ti ho vicino

Perdere l’amore
Maledetta sera
Che raccoglie i cocci
Di una vita immaginaria
Pensi che domani
È un nuovo giorno
Ma ripeti non me l’aspettavo
Non me l’aspettavo
Prendere a sassate
Tutti i sogni ancora in volo
Li farò cadere ad uno ad uno
Spezzerò le ali del destino
E ti avrò vicino
Perdere l’amore",Perdere l'Amore,1997
Lara Fabian,"Dites-moi pourquoi je l'aime
Dites-moi pourquoi
C'est comme un cadeau
Que le ciel me fait d'en haut, haut, haut
Quand cet amour nous enchaîne
S'accroche à l'eau
Dites-moi pourquoi je l'aime
Dites-moi pourquoi c'est trop
Pourquoi faut-il que je l'aime
Et que sa vie
Sa vie me coule dans les veines
Et dans ses mains je supplie
Chaque fois je me déchaîne
Quand il prend ma vie
Je ne sais plus comment
Ni où s'enfuit le temps
Quand mon corps se meurt et se perd dans ses bras

Dites-moi pourquoi je l'aime
Dites-moi pourquoi
Il est comme un bateau
Qui m'emmènerait sur l'eau
Au lieu de garder ma peine
Je crie bien plus fort
Encore plus fort que je l'aime
Et que je l'aimerai encore

Le ciel m'en a fait cadeau
Quand dans ses bras mon corps
Toute sa vie dévore
Je prie pour qu'il m'enlace encore et encore

Dites-moi pourquoi
Il est comme un bateau
Qui m'emmènerait sur l'eau

Did I hold too tight

I still want you by my side
Ooh baby, you're the best thing in my life
Can we give it one more try

And all the things that I wanted to say
The angry words that came from nowhere
without warning
That stole the moment and sent me away

And me wondering if I'd ever be back

I said I didn't come here to leave you
I didn't come here to lose
I didn't come here believing I would ever be
away from you
I didn't come here to find out
There's a weakness in my faith
I was brought here by the power of love

And I remember the road just went on forever
Just couldn't seem to turn that car around
'Till in the distance like a long lost treasure
A phone booth that just could not be found
And you standing there at the doorway waiting
And the moment when we laid back down

I said I didn't come here to leave you
I didn't come here to lose
I didn't come here believing I would ever be
away from you
I didn't come here to find out
There's a weakness in my faith
I was brought here by the power of love

And one we'll never forget
One we can leave behind

You'll remember I said

And I'm drowning but I would be damned, babe 
If you knew, I can make it through 

[Chorus]

And the sunlight on your face 
Maybe someday I will erase 
But if I do 
Could I make it through 
Through this world without loving you 

[Chorus: x2]",Till I Get Over You,2000
Lara Fabian,"Every night every day
I tell my heart to forget you and to move away
Not to break anymore
But, oh, no matter
What I say
You're so deep in my mind
There's no way to leave this love behind

It used to be
I believe I could go on and find someone to
Rest upon anyone, anyone
Soon I found
There was no other
There you are
Framed against the sky
You are my life and I pray for when
You will be mine
To love again

I see the rain in the sky
And I see your face
Through every tear that I cry
With every breath and every sound
I can hear another voice and swear that you're around
And every word is clear
'Cause I know
The memory won't let go
Until you're mine
To love again

Who's to say what lives in the past
Who's to say that love won't last
Time's been standing still
Waiting so patiently until
Until that one day when
When I will have you
To love again

And there you are
Framed against the sky
You are my life
And I pray for when
You will be mine
To love again",To Love Again (Si Tu M'Aimes),2000

Stand alive, that we breathe

Why do I hate and die

Was I too proud or just too blind

It's a cold room
With nothing inside

It will bring you back to you

Is the moment between everyone
Is the best friend you have in the world
That moment in time
Will help you to survive

You don't need to go back at all
And when you feel that
Cold room inside
Stand tall
You will embrace it
As you recall
It made you stronger after all

Is the best friend you have in the world
That moment in time
Will help you to survive

Let your consciousness finally be heard
It's unconscious
But you'll hear the burst
The voice inside will bring you back to life

En el abismo de este cuarto gris
Al amanecer

Y para qué vivir
En este plan de hoy
Qué gano con ser libre
Si no sé donde voy
No quiero más fingir
Que todo marcha bien
Si no hay tú sin mi
Y yo sin ti
No sé
No puedo ser
Sola, sola otra vez
Sola, qué insensatez
El tiempo me envuelve en un capricho de soledad
En un falsa de libertad
Que no puedo entender

Y para qué vivir
En este plan de hoy
Qué gano con ser libre
Si no sé donde voy

No quiero más fingir
Que todo marcha bien
Si no hay tú sin mi
Y yo sin ti
Ya ves que hoy
Que hoy sin ti
Se nubla el corazón
En un mar de inquietud
Que finge una estación feliz
No sé

Ya para qué vivir
La vida en un disfraz
Siguiendo siempre al mundo
Si a ti te quiero más

Ya para qué sufrir
Contéstame, anda dime
Si la distancia oprime
Que va! mejor morir
No quiero más fingir
Que todo marcha bien
Si no hay tú sin mi
Y yo sin ti
No sé
Que puedo ser
Sola otra vez

Le rose del volto gia sono pallenti
L'amore d'Alfredo perfino mi manca,
Conforto, sostegno dell' anima stanca.
Conforto ! Sostegno 
Ah, della traviata sorridi al desio 
A lei, deh, perdona ; tu accoglila, o Dio !
Ah ! Tutto, tutto fini. Or tutto, tutto fini !

La tomba ai mortali di tutto e confine

Quand j'étais gosse dans mon quartier
Dans ces provinces où rien ne bouge
Tous mes ballons étaient crevés

Je n'ai pas eu de vrai vacances
Seul, face à face avec la mer
Quand le cœur rythme la cadence
Des mouettes qui nagent dans l'air

J'ai rien d'mandé, je n'ai rien eu
J'ai rien donné, j'ai rien reçu

Je n'ai jamais joué aux billes
Quand j'étais gosse dans mon quartier
J'étais cloué dans ma famille
Comme un martyr à son bûcher

Je n'ai pas eu de promenade
Seul, face à face avec le vent
Je lisais le Marquis de Sade
Et j'aimais déjà les divans

J'ai rien d'mandé, je n'ai rien eu
J'ai rien donné, j'ai rien reçu

Les fées n'étaient pas du voyage
Quand j'étais gosse dans mon quartier
Elles vivaient de leurs avantages
Elles étaient toutes syndiquées

Je n'ai pas vu dans les étoiles
Le carrosse de Cendrillon
La mienne avait une robe sale
Mais elle n'avait pas de chaussons

J'ai rien d'mandé, je n'ai rien eu
J'ai rien donné, j'ai rien reçu

Pourtant j'avais déjà la chance
Quand j'étais gosse dans mon quartier
De ne pas attacher d'importance
A ce que les autres pensaient

Et je n'ai pas vu dans l'Histoire
Quelque guerrier ou quelque roi
Assoiffé de règne ou de gloire
Qui soit plus orgueilleux que moi

Mais j'ai fait ce que j'ai voulu

Non so come cercarti 
Ma sento una voce che 
Nel vento parla di te

Immagini del tuo viso 
Che passano all' improvviso 
Mi fanno sperare ancora 
Che ti trovero

Chiudo gli occhi e vedo te 
Trovo il cammino che 
Mi porta via 
Dall' agonia 
Sento battere in me 
Questa musica che 
Ho inventato per te 

Se sai come trovarmi 
Se sai dove certami 
Abbracciami con la mente 
Il sole mi sembra spento 
Accendi il tuo nome in cielo 
Dommi che ci sei 
Quello che vorrei

Il sole come sembra spento 
Abbracciami con la mente 
Smarrita senza di te 
Dommi chi sei e ci credero

Translation:
Adagio
I don't know where to find you 
I don't know how to reach you 
I hear your voice in the wind 
I feel you under my skin 
Whithin my heart and my soul 
I'll wait for you
Adagio 

All of these nights without you 
All of my dreams surround you 
I see and I touch your face 
I fall into your embrace 
When the time is right, I know 
You'll be in my arms 
Adagio 

I close my eyes and I find a way 
No need for me to pray 
I've walked so far 
I've fought so hard 
Nothing more to explain 
I know all that remains 
Is a piano that plays 

If you know where to find me 
If you know how to reach me 
Before this light fades away 
Before I run out of my faith 
Be the only man to say 
That you'll hear my heart 
That you'll give your life 
Forever you'll stay 

Don't let this light fade away 
No No No No No 
Don't let me run out of faith 
Be the only man to say 
That you believe, make me believe 
You won't let go

I die in your arms

Baby, it's like I'm born again

Bringing me home time and again

Do you know

Nothing more to fight

I could have sworn you were a man that would never betray
I could have sworn you were my life and my dreams and my faith
But in one moment you took that all away

Did you break me to see if I'd break
Did you want to know what I was made of big mistake
'Cause there's nothing now that you or anyone can say
So save your breath and walk away
And your excuses they make me want to scream
I could have sworn you were a man that would never be mean
I could have sworn you were the light and the end of the dark for me
But you proved that it's never what it seems

Lara Fabian,"In the desert where almost nothing grows
you'll find the most beautiful rose
takes its name from Jericho
a miracle of life
I know a place I can't deny
where even a Jericho rose would die
The desert of your heart's where I am trying to survive

Can't control this
can't let go this
feeling is all I have
I know that...

I could build a tower out of steel and stone
but trying to build a bridge to you
is something I can't seem to do
If I could turn this dust to gold
you'd see it clearly
Trying to earn your love
is just like trying to learn the art of alchemy

The measure of a woman's heart
is just how deep and just how far
a secret can be kept
till it is only distant memory
My emotions fall on stony ground
I wear them just like hand-me-downs
because I know the secret is the love
that you have for me

I can't believe
can hardly breathe
without you by my side
I know that...
I could build a tower out of steel and stone….

How could life be the same
if I find I loved in vain
The dream I have every night
is to wake with you by my side

I could build a tower out of steel and stone….",The Alchemist,2004

Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)

The more I have to go

Dans mon corps et dans ma tête
J'ai des images qui s'entêtent
J'ai des ondes de chaleur
Et comme des cris de douleur
Qui circulent dans mes veines

Quand je marche dans ma ville
J'ai des moments qui défilent
De ton pays d'ailleurs où tu meurs

Ba-ba-car
Où es tu où es tu?
Ba-ba-car
Où es tu où es tu?

Je vis avec ton regard
Depuis le jour de mon départ
Tu grandis dans ma mémoire
Ha ha, ha ha

Ba-ba-car
Où es tu où es tu?
Ba-ba-car
Où es tu où es tu?

J'ai des mots qui frappent qui sonnent
Et qui font mal comme personne
C'est comme la vie qui s'arrête
J'ai des mouvements de colère
Sur le troisième millénaire
Tout casser et tout refaire
J'ai pas manqué de courage
Mais c'était bien trop facile
Te laisser en héritage un exil

Ba-ba-car
Où es tu où es tu?
Ba-ba-car
Où es tu où es tu?

Ta princesse de hasard
Est passée comme une étoile
En emportant ton espoir
Ha ha, ha ha

Lara Fabian,"Le ciel bleu sur nous peut s'effondrer
Et la terre peut bien s'écrouler
Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes
Je me fous du monde entier
Tant que l'amour inondera mes matins
Tant que mon corps frémira sous tes mains
Peu m'importent les problèmes
Mon amour puisque tu m'aimes

J'irais jusqu'au bout du monde
Je me ferais teindre en blonde
Si tu me le demandais
J'irais décrocher la lune
J'irais voler la fortune
Si tu me le demandais

Je renierais ma patrie
Je renierais mes amis
Si tu me le demandais
On peut bien rire de moi
Je ferais n'importe quoi
Si tu me le demandais

Si un jour la vie t'arrache à moi
Si tu meurs que tu sois loin de moi
Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes
Car moi je mourrai aussi
Nous aurons pour nous l'éternité
Dans le bleu de toute l'immensité
Dans le ciel plus de problèmes

Lara Fabian,"Il venait d'avoir dix-huit ans
Il était beau comme un enfant
Fort comme un homme
C'était l'été évidemment
Et j'ai compté en le voyant
Mes nuits d'automne

J'ai mis de l'ordre à mes cheveux
Un peu plus de noir sur mes yeux
Ça l'a fait rire
Quand il s'est approché de moi
J'aurais donné n'importe quoi
Pour le séduire

Il venait d'avoir dix-huit ans
C'était le plus bel argument
De sa victoire
Il ne m'a pas parlé d'amour
Il pensait que les mots d'amour
Sont dérisoires

Il m'a dit ""j'ai envie de toi""
Il avait vu au cinéma
Le blé en herbes
Au creux d'un lit improvisé
J'ai découvert émerveillée
Un ciel superbe

Il venait d'avoir dix-huit ans
Ça le rendait presque insolent
De certitude
Et pendant qu'il se rhabillait
Déjà vaincue, je retrouvais
Ma solitude

J'aurais voulu le retenir
Pourtant je l'ai laissé partir
Sans faire un geste
Il m'a dit ""c'était pas si mal""
Avec la candeur infernale
De sa jeunesse

J'ai mis de l'ordre à mes cheveux
Un peu plus de noir sur mes yeux
Par habitude
J'avais oublié simplement
Que j'avais deux fois dix-huit ans.",II Venait d'Avoir 18 Ans,2009
Lara Fabian,"J'ai douze ans maman
J'ai pas peur du sang
Je suis plus une enfant
Pour qui tu me prends?
Faut que je me dépêche de vivre ma vie maman
J'ai déjà trouvé mon premier cheveu blanc

J'ai douze ans maman
J'ai pas beaucoup de temps
Je sais pas si tu comprends
Comment je me sens
Quand je vois passer des fusées dans le firmament
Je me dis qu'on va y goûter avant longtemps
Quand je regarde la télévision
On parle seulement de pollution
Et de surpopulation
Peut être que la bombe à neutrons
Ce sera le meilleur remède
Contre la misère sur la terre

Naturellement
Tu regardes seulement les téléromans maman
Tu ne sais pas ce qui se passe dans l'univers

J'ai douze ans maman
J'ai besoin d'argent
Je pourrais me prendre un amant
Comme dans ton temps
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire?
Pour gagner ma vie maman
Je veux pas étudier pour rien jusqu'à trente ans

Aujourd'hui à l'école on nous a parlé
Des possibilités de vie
Dans les autres galaxies
Oui
On nous a aussi montré
Un film où l'on voyait
Comment copulent les libellules

C'est quoi la vie?
J'ai pas envie
D'avoir d'enfants maman
Faut que je commence à prendre la pilule

Lara Fabian,"Au bout du téléphone, il y a votre voix
Et il y a des mots que je ne dirai pas
Tous ces mots qui font peur quand ils ne font pas rire
Qui sont dans trop de films, de chansons et de livres
Je voudrais vous les dire
Et je voudrais les vivre
Je ne le ferai pas,
Je veux, je ne peux pas
Je suis seule à crever, et je sais où vous êtes
J'arrive, attendez-moi, nous allons nous connaître
Préparez votre temps, pour vous j'ai tout le mien
Je voudrais arriver, je reste, je me déteste
Je n'arriverai pas,
Je veux, je ne peux pas
Je devrais vous parler,
Je devrais arriver
Ou je devrais dormir
J'ai peur que tu sois sourd
J'ai peur que tu sois lâche
J'ai peur d'être indiscrète
Je ne peux pas vous dire que je t'aime peut-être

Mais si tu crois un jour que tu m'aimes
Ne crois pas que tes souvenirs me gênent
Et cours, cours jusqu'à perdre haleine
Viens me retrouver
Si tu crois un jour que tu m'aimes
Et si ce jour-là tu as de la peine
A trouver où tous ces chemins te mènent
Viens me retrouver
Si le dégoût de la vie vient en toi
Si la paresse de la vie
S'installe en toi

Lara Fabian,"You walk in, the room stops moving
Every heart is yours for stealing
And every man has to have you
You must live for this feeling

This is Heaven for you
Holding souls in your hand
Making love to every eye
That you draw in every man
Who's gonna love you tonight
Who's gonna watch you turn out the light
Every woman here can see, every man would kill to be
Who's gonna love you tonight

The feel in the air gets tighter
The fire in your eyes gets brighter
Nobody better, making it look easy
You're slowly driving these boys crazy

And one, only one
Gets to hear you scream tonight
But you like this part the best
When they wait as you decide
Who's gonna love you tonight
Who's gonna watch you turn out the light
Every woman here can see, every man would kill to be
Who's gonna love you tonight

Lara Fabian,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got (yeah)
Trying to hold on
To your precious love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I now exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby
I am a man
When a man loves a woman",Caruso,2011
Lara Fabian,"When i was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun

Livin alone
I think of all the friends i've known
When i dial the telephone

All by myself
Don't wanna be

And loves so distant and obscure

Where is the humor when they hit the wall
Clowns get ready for their scars and bruises

For fear the crowd's applause dies out
If they see a tear roll down

To take the risk and wipe it all away

Took a breath celebrating what's begun
Traced the day with a hopeful brush
Smiled and watched the sky blush

Faces appeared in the morning light
Blending together brighter than bright
Voices familiar and foreign tongues
Singing to me their own songs

I heard the message in the air
Imagine the picture they wanted to share
In spite of all the blurs and tears
Love is the color we should wear

Then the clouds roll in
Oh, then clouds roll in
And the storm begins
Over us and

Over and over the over again

When we make love like this
We are totally flawless
And I know we are at our best
We are so beautiful

Never think that you don't know
How to love me it isn't so
You don't need to be the perfect thing
You don't have to give me anything
Only all you can give from your heart
You don't need to be the perfect one
You're the closest I will ever come
Oh, oh nobody's perfect at all
Nobody's perfect at all
Until you fall in love with them",Perfect,2017

Looks like the sky is falling down

Stick our heads in the ground

How will that save us now?

We can be the change that brings the lighting down
Be the thunder
We are the storm, we are the storm

If we gather all our raindrops
If we form into a wave
And take control of angry oceans
There is so much we could save
Be our own salvation
Be our own higher ground
If we recognize the power
That is what will save us now

And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't lose their shape

Ah come and get me boys ow!

But diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a heart-boiled employer thinks you're awful nice
Get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy when stakes are high but beware when they start to descend
Ooh, diamonds are a girls best

Time to unwind, time to relax

Hollow jets in my fingers and my toes
Too tired to masturbate
No sound in the dark as I float in outer space

Touch down on an AstroTurf plain
Peewee golf balls roll by my face
Golf tees hammered through my feet and my hands
Nailed as an example again

Tied down with fishing line

Fireworks go off, I hear the cheers
Smell the hot dogs
Smell the mustard and the beer

Hypodermics press down and inject
20 gallons of Canfield's diet Fudge Soda
Effervescent bubbling chocolate blood

Micron by micron my flesh starts to melt
All that's left is brain and bones
Hot beams on the cool wet sand
Bury me with the help of the wind and the waves

Submerged in the cool soil
Earthworms crawl in and crawl out
Further down is the underground aquifer cave
The bats and blind fish
Are all my friends

Soil hardens and it starts to crack
The lake is dry as desert air
Sidewinders crawl through my eye sockets
Their soft white underbelly feels like love

Blowing tumbleweeds stick to my ribs
Night falls, the sky is red
Captain Beefheart flies up on gargoyle wings
Talons reach down to take me back again

Had to them bustas quit hatin' just 'cause my boulder's bigger

And my niggas always fight over a game of dice
Everyday it's like a story, it's so much drama
My girl just found out that I'm hittin' her mama
And my niggas who went to college, they never keep in touch
And my next door neighbor, he just stole the bread truck
He also stole a taxi, would brag and wouldn't care
He started pickin' up niggaz and started chargin' 'em fare

I guess the year was about 1981
I'd say I was about eight
Standing on the corner, bullets rang out
A little hoodster exposing too much
Niggas on my block play real robbers and cops
Big sis shootin' at niggas through the mail box
'Cause motherf**kers knew it wasn't no males in the house
Momma's at work, daddy who knows?

Young and shit, already on a role
Playin' look-out for the corner dope house
Start earnin' some clout

Got me a nigga, and then my thang start learnin' the game

Doin' his thing like Sagi
I'm tired of seein niggas do it
Time to watch me
Y'all remember the channel, the time and place
Just get on the couch, a floor, and find a space
Moms and pops worked all week to get the phatter place

So your little ass had a TV on Saturday
I know I took ya back, you ain't gotta thank 'Su
Just remember, you rascals is little and I will spank you

And they won't fuck in the lab

Thirty million sold and that I'll just stay at that now what about that
Listen to the thuggish
And listen to every other rapper rap about who that come from
Talkin' Bone fell off
Say what they bust just like us
They ain't even knowin' were it came from like richer niggas
They ain't going to give it to us so we gon take it

Put up yo money honey what ever ya got we won't lose
Put up or shut up
Get slapped in front of all your dogs
And all your dudes
Cause I'm a smarter thug all ways wanted to be a thug
What do you think
Do you think he gon do something
Don't let the money fool you
Don't let the money do you
Cause it ain't really about nothin' (nothin')
Its just so much they gon let in
Toss that we gon show you who you are messin' with

We can do it
We can rumble

And let the whole world crumble
All I ever seen was heavy smoke in the air
Bustin' heavy shots
They just don't care
If you don't then I'm goin to get all the bloodiness
Niggas want peace but I know they all goin' test us
The thugs comin' back to bring the thug essence
Thugs comin' back to bring back the thug blessings
For the lord where doin' to fight the wind
I'ma fight to get them all hyped again
Tell the Bone Thug story again
If a nigga still hatin' a pipe again
Like I did before creep creep and I came
Just four more niggas down for there thing
Never been afraid to let my nuts hang
How to you think Bone Thug made it to the top of the game nigga

How to get her sexy body on

Murda murda I wrote it in braile
Uncut, lyrical dope, certified by my scale
The homicide rapper, there'll never be another after
The Mac's rapture, I represent, that's what I'm on the map for
Who the fuck gonna fuck with the scandalous
1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss
?Platonic?, the lyrical killins don't got no motives
In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river
I enter the place, ski mask covered my face
If they pass me the mic, I'm gonna catch a case
In this mothafucka ya heard of me

Never die, my motto, fatigue my sheet

Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya

Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated

Woo, yeah, aha, aha, you know
Yeah, word up

Come on, lights, cameras, action it's on
Straight outta gate with another hot song
Keepin' it real though gonna last long
Break out the stiletto coming mad strong

Bounce if you wanna, lounge will play the corner
I'm New York talking that gangster talk
Twenty-four bases, queue to the oasis
Suspicious see eyes and no faces

Been there, years just put in to work
For the dough, so you know that I couldn't get jerked
Street mental, throw on the hoodie then lurk
In the rental until the end of the earth

I'ma be that fellow with the mozzarella
Always cooking up the new hot seller
Putting that money in the bank like the teller
And this be the number one rank, let me tell you

In 2000 new car, new house and
Buy the whole store up, style I'm too pro, son
Get even more buck wild, I draw crowds and

In every state I still draw them at every forum
Don't lose no points I just score them
And count blessings at the top of my freshness
Live, get it right this is not no job

Today or tomorrow it doesn't matter
Got the stages moving on up the ladder
And stay grounded, remember the Bronx 'cause they founded
Cutting them old joints up by James Brown, kid

Golden, 'fore I forget hold it
Got to shout out the block, four-fifth Holden
And Jamaica, Queens I'm true to the fort
Every day, all day not new to the sport

In Elisabeth, kids in Queens is who I feast with
When I ain't in the lab flipping beats with
Drums to pound, I be breaking it down
With homeboy Van on the way uptown, how that sound

It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time

There's a whole lot of rappers in the world today
Some good, there is some that got nothing to say
Some fake, some false, some imitation
But I'm the uncut raw for your generation

Work magic with terms like never before
Hang them rappers live, leave their head on the floor
Drop hits for the hip hop crowd that rock kicks and hats
Crisped jeans and whips to match

Hardcore system up on blast
Cock, dip and stash live now and forget the past
In the streets try to hustle while eating a meal
Watching out so you don't get beaten in the grill

'Cause the crossroads is deep, sleep and you will
Be the next one up, I'm feeding the real
So get eardrums son, start heating the drill

My religion is reefer
Big money and the most
Uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic
Nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existence
God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread
I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas
Why argue niggas
The truth is the truth
I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like
Right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice
I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

What we talking bout niggas
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what recollect fucker

Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis

A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash

Love, righteous and real

A dream I could touch

A trust I could feel

I had it all and I threw it away

With some stupid move I wish I could take back today

Was I lost was I blind that I couldn?t see

What losin' you would do to me.


I must?ve been high

To let you walk away, to let you say goodbye

I must?ve been high

How could I let you go, darlIn?, I?ll never know

I must?ve been high

Stoned out of my mind.


Time has opened my eyes

These empty arms have made my heart wise

I?ll never find a better lover and friend

I?m ashamed to admit what a fool I?ve been

And I know I?ve got no right to be

Begging you to come back to me

I can only plead insanity

Have mercy, baby, mercy.


I must?ve been high

To let you walk away, to let you say goodbye

I must?ve been high

How could I let you go, darlin', I?ll never know

Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends

And you know the soft spots under my skin
Deep down inside me, where no one has been
We've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind
But time's only sweetened this love that we're in

And we've come full circle, all the way 'round
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends

We've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sun
We've come full circle and we've just begun

We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
(We've come full circle)
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round

You know we've cried in the darkness and we've laughed in the sun
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)
But we've stayed together and we've just begun
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)

Wär' der Beat meine Ehefrau, dann wäre ich Ike Turner
Ich reim' Wörter, leb in einer Welt voller Einhörner
Trolle, Goblins und Hobbits ich kenn das Monster von Loch Ness
Wir haben uns vor ein paar Wochen getroffen und aßen Pommes
Chill mit Fabelwesen, die meine Sprache reden im Garten Eden
Gerade eben schaute ich ein paar Ewoks zu beim Harlemshaken
Danach geh ich rüber zu meinem Grasdealer Gargamel
Hol mir etwas Schlumpf, Kush und parallel
Während ich das gerade erzähl, seh ich Sieben Zwerge in meinem Garten stehen
Bemerk wie ein paar Elfen ihnen helfen und meinen Rasen mähen
Seh wie Edward Scissorhands, Wolverine und Freddy Kruger
Zusammen meine Hecke trimmen, jeder will es besser können
Dankeschön, auch an meinen Jedi Ritter Babysitter
Schneewittchen und Prinzessin Leia sind meine Babymütter
Ständig Babymama-Drama ahn' mal
Ich dachte damals es war Pech, aber es war Karma
Plötzlich kommt Darth Vader an und sagt er ist mein Vater
Und ich denk nur aha, da mein Vater nie da war wie eine Fata Morgana
Und Mama immer gesagt hat, er war ein Schwarzer
Und da er verdammt schwarz ist sag ich einfach nur Papa, haha
Ja, ich bin ein sicker Motherfucker
Chill mit Alice im Wunderland, sie sagt
„Mr. Lover, Lover, komm zurück“
Und ich komm zurück, jeder Song Deluxe
Denn ich bin Deluxe, wer hat sonst so Hits? Au

Ich mach ein Wettrennen mit Ben Ten, trinke Alk mit Hulk
Jetzt ist er drin im Körper
Besuche paar SOS Kinderdörfer mit dem Silver Surfer
Was ist der Sinn der Wörter (jap!) ich bin ein Gestörter (jap!)
Und wenn ihr meine Stimme gehört habt
Dann wisst ihr ich bin ein Killer, Mörder
Der sich zufällig in eurem Keller verirrt hat
Wohin ich mich teleportiert hab
Nachdem mich Dr. Doom in eine Zelle gesperrt hat
Wo Superwoman meine Bälle entleert hat
Geht es um Fantasie, da gibt es keinen Rapper, der mehr hat
Ich will gegen Kevin Eleven ein Battle rappen
Mitten im 7-11, ihr solltet lieber mein Level checken
Sag deinem Produzenten bleib auf dem Teppich wie Sindbad
Weil er so schrecklich rumklimpert, was dich beim Rappen bloß hindert
Rapper rappen behindert, alles nur Papperlapapp
Ich hab Beats fett wie Jabba the Hutt, schreibe einen Reim und pack ihn in Takt
Ändere das Wetter wie Storm, bin zum Rapper geboren
Spitz mal besser die Ohren, denn keiner hier kann besser performen
Seh wie mein Homie Obi-Wan Kenobi gerade Koks zieht
Ich sage was is los mit dir, da is gegen die Vorschrift

Plötzlich kommt Yoda und sagt „oha, hast du noch Koks da?“
Obi-wan sagt „oh ja, aber nicht soviel wie Conan oder Thor da“
Und Magneto hat ein Kilo feinstes Coca aus Mordor
Was für'n Horror, alle meine Superhelden sind Kokser (oh nein)
Plötzlich kommt Harry Potter, sagt, dass er Pott hat
Und mach dich mal locker, Samy, check mal lieber dieses Odd ab aus Hogwarts

Feier mich gerade auf down south hardcore Rap
Mit dem Terminator weg
Plötzlich klingelts an der Tür und es ist Dagobert Duck mit dem Punisher
Sagt: „Samy, schön dich zu sehen, es ist so lange her“
Ich sag: „Nein, du warst gerade gestern hier und vorgestern hier
Denn du bist zu geizig selber Geld zu investieren
Willst nur Gras schnorren, bist nur 'n Arschloch
Jeder kifft hier am Block, geh doch zu Spongebob“
Er sagt: „Nein, denn der hat das Thaiweed aus Bangkok
Und hört Punkrock, Funk, Pop oder Truckstop
Außerdem ist Willi da, hier ist viel chilliger
Ich chill lieber mit dir, denn du rauchst wie 'ne Dampflok“
Ding dong, kann es sein, dass ich schon wieder 'ne Klingel hör?
Ich bin empört, wer ist das zur Hölle? Das sind die Ninja Turtles
Und die Panzerknacker und sagen „Was geht ab, Motherfucker?
Wir hörten hier steigt 'ne Party oder was geht ab? Ha?“
Ich denk wahrscheinlich soll's so sein, ich lad sie auf ein paar Holsten ein
Auf einmal rollt Professor X in seinem Rollstuhl rein
Und ich denk „Wow, wer ist diese Frau? Jean Grey!“
Normalerweise bin ich ein Teamplayer, aber öh jetzt gerade nicht
Sage ich dem DJ, ich will jetzt mit Jean Grey Tango tanzen
Doch sie will mit Rambo tanzen (was?)
Spiel ein bisschen Enrique Iglesias
Ich hab hier ein paar Platten von ebay

Auf einmal kommt Iron Man, sagt: „Lass uns feiern, Sam
Komm wir gründen eine Band, wir nennen sie Iron Man
Featuring Samy Deluxe“
Ich sag: „Nein, wir nennen sie Lieber Samy Deluxe featuring Iron Man“
Roger Rabbit sagt, ihr habt schon einen Fan
Captain America sagt, dass er gerne den Nightliner fährt
Freddy Kruger sagt, dass er gerne Merchandiser wär'
Ich sage: „Das wird leider schwer“

Kommen langsam, aber sicher zum Abschluss
Und ich wollte euch noch eine Nummer zeigen
Die einfach so bisher unveröffentlicht rumliegt
Nena und ich ha'm bisschen Musik gemacht die letzten Jahre
Für ihr Album, ma' für mein Album
Und es gibt aber auch so 'n paar Songs
Von denen wir noch nicht genau wissen was wir damit machen
Aber eine hat's jetzt in dieses unplugged Set geschafft

Airports and rental cars
Ain’t no time like now
To play it out
If you’re uncertain
Just why you’re hurtin’
Your heart would like to
Laugh at your doubt
And the songs that we sing
All have dust on their wings
And most of our feathers are ruffled
No use deciding
Just keep on easy riding
And keeping your seat belt buckled
If you don’t give a damn
Where you go, what you do, or who you are
Darlin’ I understand
Just get back in the car.	
Spend our days chasing money
If you don’t laugh, it’s just not funny
Trying to be cool when we’re not
Late night pancakes and bacon
We all feel like were faking
Just glad when the miles have stopped 
And the songs that we sing
Still make the bells ring
But we fell asleep for the sermon
When the preachers did tell
Where we’re headed, oh well
Hell is just heaven still learning
Might as well sing while we’re burning",Gurus and Rockstars,2008

I've been thinking about the way it used to be
When my life was so full and free
I don't remember leaving

I guess what I'm trying to say
Thought I was a captive
with no freedom of my own
But the further I traveled
The more I longed for home

I'm going back to my first love
For the fire burns and
My heart still yearns
To go back to my first love
Well I never should have walked away

Looking where my heart's been
Every road just seemed to end
But to find the peace that's waiting up ahead
I've got to go back to my first love

I know I can't explain it
How the Father always seems to know
this struggle within my soul
Although he could have held on
His love was strong enough to set me free
Without letting go of me
Don't know how He found me
In this barren desert land
But springs of living water
Are calling me again

I'm going back to my first love
For the fire burns and
My heart still yearns
To go back to my first love
Well I never should have walked away

Looking where my heart's been

Has been waiting for this day

If you want a world that’s more loving
Then you’ve got to love somebody
You want to be in world that’s more caring
Then reach out and help somebody
You’ll make the world a better place

And if I say it loud enough
Maybe somebody else will hear
That love is still the greatest of all gifts
And if we give ourselves in love
The world will see a brighter place
'Cause it keeps time with every step we take

Then you’ve got to love somebody
You want to be in a world that’s more caring
Then reach out and help somebody

To live in a world with more sharing
You’ll just have to do more giving
If you want the earth filled with joyful noise
Then open your heart and start singing
Make this world a better place

The world is you and the world is me
And it will be what we make it
Let’s fill it up with so much love 
There won’t be room enough to take it

Larnelle Harris,"The love of God has been extended
To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

His power is eternal, eternal
His glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love Of God, precious love of God

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,

We had watched as his life ebbed away

Wrapped his body and sealed up the grave

Won't matter anymore

And I'll never be the same again

Those kind gentle words
Asking what was her reason for tears
And I sobbed in despair

He said, child! it is I, I am here!

Larrieux,"Dedicated to my son that's about to be born
So by the time you people hear this record
My son'll be born
And I gotta teach him about life

Listen, to my little man, you can never have too little plans
Always bring your game direct, cut out the middle man
Life is full of sacrifice, for truth you might have to fight
Someone'll bring you down 'cause they ain't livin' right

Be sure to use your mind, though, look for all the signs, yo
Don't want to make a move too quick and get left behind, yo
Be in command of whatever you encounter
Appreciate your blessings, son, you'll see what it amounts to

Obtainin' your goals, maintainin' control
Self-respect helps you to protect your soul
Never give up, always be ready to try
Walk your own walk and keep your head to the sky

Little thing now here you are
Starin' at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat and cry
But one day, you're gonna be askin' me why

Everything I know, I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't, you'll figure out
'Cause livin' is learnin' and learnin' is livin'
And then you pass it on

And to my home boys, who clearly understand
What it really takes to be a man
And what it means to be the head of fam
The ups and downs of life plus the choices we make
Causes to reevaluate directions we take

And bein' up in the club is mad fun 'til they act dumb
And everyone still packs
It's time now for us to separate the mediocre from the great
Keep all the jokers from the game

I've played my position, so why don't you try to play yours?
I've made my decision, plus you're in my prayers
My life is changed now, plus I got a shorty now
Mad responsibilities, it's like, I'm almost forty now

All the young girls wanna swing, my wifey says, she wants a ring
I wonder what the next days, are gonna bring?
We must live and fight for the right causes and be ready to die
I love you kid, so keep your head to the sky

Little thing now here you are
Starin' at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat and cry
But one day, you're gonna be askin' me why

Everything I know, I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't, you'll figure out
'Cause livin' is learnin' and learnin' is livin'
And then you pass it on

Baby child, did you know?
Every since you fell out of the heavens
You make me wanna grow
So I'll share with you everything
Make little girls and boys
Grow up to be kings and queens

Little thing now here you are
Starin' at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat, and cry
But one day, you're gonna be askin' me why

Everything I know, I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't, you'll figure out
'Cause livin' is learnin' and learnin' is livin'
And then you pass it on

Little thing now here you are
Starin' at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep, eat, and cry
But one day, you're gonna be askin' me why

Everything I know, I'm gonna tell you about
Anything I don't, you'll figure out

Larrikin Love,"On September 3rd 2003 
I was softly touched by a warm summer breeze 
There were blue tits flocking and swerving 
My accuracy is quite unnerving 

I stole into a burnt, orange field 
Which once was green, but lost its zeal 
To prance and dance and sing around 
Which is not condoned in the centre of town 

Children please beware! 
I'm choked with fear 
Oh children please beware! 
I'm choked with fear 
(repeat) 

And as I crunched those crispy leaves 
I walked towards a shaded tree 
To find a young girl lying there 
Drifting off without a care 

Her face was covered by a straw hat 
'Happy as Larry' and all of that 
When I shouted out to wake her up 
She was skipping school in the burning hot 

Children please beware! 
I'm choked with fear 
Oh children please beware! 
I'm choked with fear 
(repeat) 

And as I tried to get her to speak 
I realised that she was not asleep 
I moved her hat to find that her face was grey 
Her knickers wrapped around her ankles 
It's not funny! 

Children please beware! 
I'm choked with fear 
Oh children please beware! 
I'm choked with fear 
(repeat) 

Swamped with fear... 
Drown in fear...

And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

For his tired footsteps, climbing up the stairs.
Ah, oh, old man sorrow's come to keep me company
Whispering beside me when I say my prayers.

Ain't that a mine working
Working I and I travelers
Journeying together to the promised land
But old man sorrow's marching all the way with me,
Telling me I'm old now since I lost my man
Since I lost my man.

Old man sorrow's sitting by the fireside,
Lying all night long by me in the bed.
Telling me the same thing morning, noon and evening,
That I'm all alone now since my man is dead.
Ah, since my man is dead.

The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is girl and boy meant
Fall in love you won't regret it

That's the best work of all if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky

And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one

once again runnin' away with me.

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Sweat so hard just to end my fears.

Started work but as second class.

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

Larry Carlton,"After we love, we bathe in a glow
Remembering what happened a moment ago
Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh
While it's resting on pillows of sky
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you

After the rain, the birds want to fly
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see
Are their loving reflections of me
After a while, you touch me and then
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again

I could stay for hours like this
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain",After the Rain,1995

And everything was quiet for the night
When suddenly the clock strikes one
The fun's begun

The dolls are in their best arrayed
There's going to be a wonderful parade
Hark to the drum, now here they come
Come on, everyone

Hear them all cheering, now they are nearing
There's the captain stiff as starch
Bayonet's flashing, music is crashing
As the wooden soldiers march

Sabers a-clinking, soldiers a-winking
At each pretty little maid
Here they come, here they come
The wooden soldiers on parade

Daylight is creeping, dollies are sleeping
In the toy shop window fast
Soldiers so jolly, think of each dolly
Dreaming of the night that's past

When in the morning without a warning
Toy man pulls the window shade
There's no sign the wood brigade
Was ever out upon parade

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?

We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again

No one else in the world could pull apart

And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has its day, everybody has to pay

With an apple he was tempted and deceived
Just for spite the devil made him take a bite
And that's where old Adam met his Waterloo

Larry Gatlin,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers Band,"The doors to the mission open at seven
And the soup will be ready about nine
Right now it's six-thirty, they're ragged and dirty
They're standin' and sittin' and layin' in line

First they'll do a little singin', then hear a little preachin'
And get saved for the 3rd time this week
A bowl of soup later and a pat on the shoulder
And by midnight, they're back on the street

They walk to the corner of 4th street and Broadway
Then take the first alley on the right
One of them asks a stranger, ""How 'bout a hand""?
And he gives 'em one finger at a time

Then they spot an old buddy with a bottle of heaven
Then pass around what means everything
One bottle for four, thank God, someone scored
And now the midnight choir starts to sing

Will they have Mogen David in Heaven?
Dear Lord, we'd all like to know
Will they have Mogen David in Heaven, sweet Jesus?
If they don't, who the hell wants to go?

Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California,
It don't matter at all where you've played before.
California's a brand-new game.

Tryin' to be a hero, winding up a zero,
Can scar a man forever right down to your soul.
Living on the spotlight can kill a man outright
'Cause everything that glitters is not gold.
