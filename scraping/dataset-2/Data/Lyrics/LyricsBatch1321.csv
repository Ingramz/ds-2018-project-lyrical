Blenders,"Do you remember the last time I said
If I ever thought of lying
I'd rather think of dying instead
And the last time you called me
To say we were through
How it took a million tears
Just to prove they all were for you
 
But it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
You just did not love me
 
'Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be
In the most unfaithful arms
That you always picture me 
Though I can't always show proof I was true
No one else could change my mind
Or stop me coming home to you
 
But it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
You just did not love me
 
Enough to believe me
Enough not to leave me
Enough not to look for
A reason to be unhappy with me
And make me regret ever wanting you
 
It wouldn't have made any difference
Wouldn't have made any difference",It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference,2000

Blenders,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Blenders,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2005
Blenders,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Blessed Hope Chapel Praise Team,"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen could ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell

The guilty pair bowed down with care
God gave His Son to win
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made
Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill
And ev'ry man a scribe by trade

To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Tho' stretched from sky to sky

How measureless and strong

Precious memories are clear before my eyes
I can hear your voice calling out my name
But I don't know you now, nothing stays the same

All along I have wanted you
I pray tonight that you want me, too
All along there was no one else
I've been waiting here all by myself

If you were here with me we'd ride the ocean tide
To that special place I help for you deep inside
I've kept good company since you've been away
Lonely stayed with me with pride began to fade

All along I have wanted you
I pray tonight that you want me, too
All along there was no one else
I've been waiting here all by myself

And I will follow you til the end of time
Til our love is at the end of the line
You rolled out of my life just like the wind
And left behind a broken heart

You don't know where you're going and you don't know how to try

Like the ""lie"" in believe
The ""I"" in deceive
The ""her"" in together
The ""we"" in the weather
He said a lot of things I'm sure he meant them at the time
But it's not the end of the world

Well you didn't see it coming cause you never understood
That there's a time to draw the line when things are going good
But you just kept on giving beyond the call of love
And he was kind to rob you blind of the pieces of your heart
Like that part that made you give
And the part that made you weak
When he would softly kiss you
And tell you that he missed you
I know it doesn't seem like what I'm going to say is true
But it's not the end of the world
It's not the end of the line
You know there's more to love
You know there's more to life
And I know there's more to you

Well I can't help but think about you in the middle of the night

And I don't want to lead you on
So if you feel the need
Close your eyes and share this dream
It will be eternity

Forever for tonight
I will be there to hold you through the night
Forever for tonight
I will love you forever for tonight

Feelings much too strong for us not to try
And if by chance we lose this fight

You will never be alone
So if you feel the need
Take my hand, and share this night

Made a lot of music and I've made a lot of friends
I've got two children but I've never had a wife
Don't mean to bore you with the story of my life

I've been criticized for all the things I've done
But I must admit that I did it all in fun

It's been a long hard road but I wouldn't change a thing

I'm just lucky to be here
I can't believe I got this far
And if I stopped along the way to fight a tear
I'm sorry
But I thought I saw my dream

There's been so much that I've learned along the way
I learned that love is color blind and how to pray
And that emotions were controlled from deep inside
But what I learned the most was how to swallow pride

She don't care about my money
And that's read good cause I don't got alot to spend
But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin
She likes me for me
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults and indecisions
My insecure condition
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed
She don't care about my big screen
Or my collection of DVDs
Things like that just never mattered much to her
Plus she don't watch too much TV
And she don't care that I can fly her
To places she ain't never been
But if she really wants to go 
I think deep down she knows that
All she has to say is when
She likes me for me
Not because I hang with Leonardo
Or that guy who played in ""Fargo""
I think his name is Steve
She's the one for me
And I just can't live without her

are gonna show us what we're made of in the end

Not because I sing like Pavorotti
Or because I'm such a hottie
I like her for her
Not because she's fat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
Why does she waste all her time with me
There must be something there that I don't see
She likes me for me
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Harry

I could probably stay awake til noon time 
So frustrating knowing what could be 
What's even worse is she used to belong to me 
As I toss and turn there's nothing I can do 
But if she couldn't sleep maybe we could make up 
But I just can't seem to wake her up this time 
Oh, no If she couldn't sleep 
I know she'd tell herself maybe she might need 
A little time to stop her heart from bleeding so 
Like me, I wish she couldn't sleep 
8AM and she's not at home 
Stayed out all night wonder if she's all alone or 
With someone new and she won't even call 
To ease my mind just to help me break the fall 
Now I'm feeling all the things I put her through 
But if she couldn't sleep maybe we could make up 
But I just can't seem to wake her up this time 
Oh, no if she couldn't sleep

Yesterday, she walked out of my life 
She said it was the best for both of us 
The other day, I was doin' fine 
But yesterday was the last day of my life 
Every minute I'm alone I watch the phone 
I can't believe 
It's so pathetic how my imagination 
Gets the best of me 
Maybe I'll phone her up, won't act grown up 
Then she'll hang up the line

But we just wanted more 
From the first time that we made eyes 
We knew there was something there 
And if this is the last time 
Then let's pretend we never met 
So we can start again 
We could learn how to be real good friends

is taking for granted what's taken us years
To build from the ground up with all of the tears that we cried

There was a tear in my half smile
That you could see a mile away

I didn't mind
Truth is it was about time
And there was no way I was
Losing you

So I want you to know
I'm gonna show
The better side of me

I want you to see
The man underneath
The better side of me

Come look inside
You're gonna find
The better part of me

I'm not the same
Person you knew
The one that used to hurt you
I had to leave him far behind

So it's safe to fall
Into my arms
Knowing I will catch you
Cause I want to give you
Peace of mind

So wherever we go
I'm gonna show
The better side of me

I want you to be
The first one to see
The better side of me

Looking in my eyes
And there you will find
The better part of me

And I just want to apologize for wasting so much time
When all along I knew that there was only

",Better Side of Me,2005
Blessid Union of Souls,"Guess you had to leave the old for something new
But don't apologize cause I realize you had to do what you had to do
I feel something's going on but how can I be sure?
I can hear the lies materialize as I 
Visualize you lying on the bathroom floor
You see a figure walk across the room and then you close the door
You close the door

You had to be free of me to get your thrill
But I hate to be the one to spoil your fun 
But honey fun don't pay the bills
You got me spinning 'round like I'm a revolving door
Don't it ever cross his mind who's on the other line 
As you lay upon your bathroom floor?

You pain is bittersweet yet so sublime
It's getting hear the end can we rewind?
Your love is bittersweet yet so sublime
Sweet sublime

Can't you see my mellow's paper-thin?
And since the way you spend my days 
And nights inside the cell you've gone and left me in
But you tell me that you never lock the door
Don't you find it kind of odd how you play God 
Right there while you're on your bathroom floor?

Your pain is bittersweet yet so sublime
It's getting near the end can we rewind?

Promises may get broken

I promise
I will hold you closer and closer
I will hold you in these arms of mine
I will hold you, hold you, hold you
Closer, closer
Over and over again

With nothing else to say
Like I was never here

She said her last goodbye
And kept her tears inside
As if I was never here

Like any other day
You wouldn't even know
You couldn't even tell
That I was ever here

I can't say that I'm the same
But I don't think she's fazed
Like I was never here

While I can't sleep a wink
She hasn't missed a beat
Like I was never there

When I was what she needed the most
And she was feeling all alone
Those days and memories
Have seemed to have come and gone

Of the corners of my mind
And I go there all the time

And it knocked my off my feet
Like a girl I should not meet
But, oh it tasted sweet
To me

And it turned me around
Now I can't hear the sound of my soul

Right where I am
I'm going crazy
Right where I am
I've gone too far
Right where I stand
I plead my case to you
I need redemption

I felt the darkness
Of the places I have been
Things I should not have seen
Now there's nothing left to believe

My innocence
Is something of my past
Guess I knew it would not last
I was chosen by this path
To live

And it turned me around
Now I can't hear the cry of my soul

Right where I am
I hope you'll save me
Right where I am
Have I gone too far
Right where I stand
I hide my face from you
I need redemption

Right where I am
I can't explain how
I got where I am
I am not so proud
Right where I stand
I need to face this truth
I need redemption

I've seen the end
Of all my tears
I'll waste not another day on this
And in the end

I've seen the shadows
Of the corners of my mind
Now I can't hear the cry

Right where I am
I'm going crazy
Right where I am
I've gone too far
Right where I stand

There's a comfort in the cross

On the hill above the town

Something steady for the meek

When it all comes crashing down

I've been known to talk to Jesus

But only when I needed to

I've got lots that needs forgiving

It all comes back to you


Out here searching for my shelter

I crossed the river 7 times

Wanna hear your sweet voice calling

Down the valley, through the pines

I need something to believe in

Thirsty for a little truth

I've been running short on faith

My faith runs back to you


There's a quiet in the twilight

That's when I talk to you

Can you hear me

I pray you hear me

Yeah, I hope I'm getting through

No one else could touch me

You had a way of cutting true

I've been bleeding for you darling

My blood runs back to you

My faith runs back to you

It all comes back to you

Look at the years we wasted, on the corner block still slangin' (slagin')
No matter how much we try to make peace, gun shots still rangin' (rangin')
'cause to be a hood legend, you die first, then become famous
'cause I done seen this type of thing before
Just hangin' out by the corner store
Stick up kids wit them guns galore
Layin' there, body down, stretched on the floor
I thought about it, man I'm way too fly
To have a fella robbin' me outside
That's why I keep that thing by my side
And down every blessin' while I'm screamin' out

[Chorus]

I hate to say it but the people that surrounding me
Are way too shady
The only people I can trust is my family and my lady
All my dogs got guns
Ready for action
They wont betray me
Your the type to run
Or to hold my tongue
When it gets crazy
See I been through this type of thing before
Even had trouble with the law
On the couch when the smash my door
But they wont find the cash stashed under the floor
I never could understand the problem
I was the one to pull the shoulders drop
Couldnt live this type of life no more
So I had a part of me screamin out

[Chorus]

I'm in blue, wit them BF frames
Walkin on lean, while mind chain hangs
Drivin' somethin, pronounce mad strange
Never mad cool, 'cause I been through flames
Walk wit a limp, 'cause I been through games
Now shes a ho, 'cause she been through gangs
Beef wit ghats for a small chunk change
I'm rich now, that's more chunk change
The cops know slang
Man get the picture before u out the frame
Call me heart throb, 'cause I'm so fame
Couldn't come close if u sat in my Range
My scars can prove but I'm passion and pain

That good sweet candy man's in town
It's the candy man

He sells as fast a hog can chew his corn

All heard what sister Johnson said
She always takes a candy stick to bed
Don't stand close to the candy man
He'll leave a big candy stick in your hand
He sold some candy to sister Bad
The very next day she took all he had
If you try his candy, good friend of mine
You sure will want it for a long long time
His stick candy don't melt away
It just gets better, so the ladies say

Surrounds me now
The bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
Leaving the darkness now, forever?
The memories of children
And the wisdom of many lifes
Burns deep in me
Where will the light go to?
Where will the light go to?
Is this deliverance?
Is it the end?

I'm back there's a new chance for me
And all my memories are gone

It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine

To walk down to the wasteland

Will it be the end

And what I saw
And how it ends

Blind Guardian,"Hallelujah 
I am a preacher with a message for my people 
Over the world, scratching on the ground 
Looking for the peace that nobody has found 

I am a spokesman for a better way of living 
Love is the word and it can be heard 
If you are young the message can be sung 

Let me hear you sing, Hallelujah 
Oh tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall 
Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all 
Tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd 
Tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified 

There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find 
If you live and let the people in your world speak its mind 

I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom 
All over the world and it can be heard 
If you are young the message can be sung

The madman's head it

Shall be thyne
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in disguise
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright

Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided by the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach

Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra
You may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Sister mine
Death's a certain thing
Find myself in darkest places
Find myself drifting away
And the other world
The other world appears

Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed
I'm falling down
As time runs faster
Moves towards disaster

The ferryman will wait for you
My dear

And then there was silence
Just a voice from other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade

Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end Iliad

Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all

Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of there
You've chosen misery
Power and wisdom
You deny
Bad choice

War is the only answer
When love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made to the fairest
The graceful says badly he fails

Warning
Fear the heat of passion, father king
Don't let him in
Don't let her in
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
We can't get out
Once they are in

She's like the sunrise
Outshines the moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price

In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
Jealousy
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now

The thread of life is spun
The coin's been placed below my tongue

Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side
So we can win
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side
Old moon's time is soon to come

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose
Like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man

Roar roar roar roar
Troy Troy Troy Troy

And as the lion
Slaughters man
I am the wolf
And you're the lamb

Hallowed Troy will fall
Round the walls
Faith is shattered bodies fall

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose
Like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out

I feel that something's wrong
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept our of sight
We live we die

Misty tales and poems lost

In the end Iliad

Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

Roam in darkness
Spread the vision
We will be lost if you truly believe
Troy in darkness
There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
That they've gone away
And won't come back

They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie, lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome
The old foe

The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite
The end is near
You better be prepared

The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing
And dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
The war it is over forevermore

No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die

Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone

Break the spell show me the way

The flame of Troy will shine bright

Holy light shines on

So the judgement's been made
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom

Your handsome son is heading home

Heading home

Still the wind blows
Calm and silent

Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever

They keep struggling on in anger

Fiercely intense
Outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord

And future secret
Most called him once

And future king
Far back in the past
I saw his ending
Long before it started

I knew his name
He's the one who took the sword
Out of the stone
It's how that ancient tale began

I hear it in the cold winds

I had seen it in my dreams

Take him back to Avalon

Dwell on for a new age
So long sleep well my friend
Take him back to Avalon
I will wait and guard

Suddenly
A perfect simulation

Come
Take a look
Breathe it in
Artificial wonderlands
We are wandering around
Things shall vanish
They won't last

Wait
I can feel things are not right
Do not breathe
Don't look behind
There's someone else
The observer

A trick of light
A fading line
The entrance is gone
We can't get out of it
We are slightly losing ground

Quick
It is time
We shall go
We better leave
And don't come back
No way to run
Nowhere to hide
I fear we are walking aimlessly

Don't you just take the dark way out

Don't you doubt

So why does it give? Why the take? Why the bitter kiss? 
Why the me? Why the anything? Just be the man
Be the child, be the cold midnight soaking the bones of this town
In the breath, in the beak, in the honey taken from every green thing giving sweet

Not one shiver in my heart

I know that’s easy to do
If your light is shining in another’s arms
I can’t say it isn’t true
It isn’t true. It isn’t true 

But just to see the sky split its arms open wide
It was enough

If I came to you in sunlight
Not one reason in my heart
Like the colors sleeping underneath your garden
Trying to grow themselves apart
All apart, all apart

And for every year just wondering
If I could ever fall enough

Hollow hope of what is coming, a lifetime dangled by a string
But this ocean dives so deeply and this river runs so wide 
I won't be counted one among them until my soul is satisfied 
Brick and brick of buried hunger keeping all desire dark
And then we are like lions, we are tearing it apart
There are those among us lying, saying nothing is for free 
And then we are like lions, we will not leave until we eat

Playing kings and playing peasants, do we get what we are owed? 
An eagle comes and talks of failure, a rabbit offers up its throat
Will they buy even our breathing, a river strangled by a damn?

Is it worse to see no future? Is it worse to be afraid? 
And then we are like lions, pumping fire in our veins 
We are born in perfect hunger, we are born with perfect need
And then we are like lions, we are baring all our teeth

It is coming down the mountain, fear that holds you like the cold 
It wants to settle in your footprints, keep you still from where you're going
All you think you know of losing, all you doubt of innocence 
That big sky still hangs above you, every day just want to quit
There's no light you see to guide you and it scares you just to say
And then we are like lions, nothing dares get in our way
See your faithless sails drifting and your truth just cut apart
And then we are like lions, we are golden in our hearts

And then we are like lions, we are standing on two feet
Hang it on the kitchen wall for everyone to see 
Get out your banjo so we can sing

There are winds that wrap and hold me, there are whispers in the trees 
I cannot hold all that is sacred, they are holding onto me
Kiss the years that all are dying, kiss the face that makes you stay
They are in your rhythms walking, they are showing you the way
Breath and breath above a sickness shouting threats upon your life
And then we are like lions, we are fool enough to fight
It will cheat you in the balance, taking more than left to live
And then we are like lions, we are strong enough to give",Like Lions,2016

Left me in this world alone

And he loved makin' and just singin' the blues

Put a wreath of flowers at my right side
Then you'll know that McTell's satisfied
Put a bouquet in my breast
You know poor boy's gone to rest
You must lay some flowers on my grave

Now when this old building is fallin' down
Just lay me six feet in the cold, cold ground
Wrap me up in the solid clay
'Cause I come here to die one day
Hot mama, lay some flowers on my grave

What a moaning glory at my hidden feet
Then you'll know that McTell's gone to sleep
On my headboard write my name
I leave 'em many girl's heart in pain
Hot mama, lay some flowers on my grave

Don't snatch the pillow from under my head
Don't grieve and worry after the days I'm dead
When I bid you this last goodbye
Don't none of you women's cry
You just lay some flowers on my grave

Now when I'm gone, come no more
And [Incomprehensible]

You'll know McTell is in the ground

I'm in this world and she's in another

And You must be my arms around her now

We both agreed on this choice
To let me be helpless
And she to stick to your voice
Me to my knees everyday I guess

Leave footprints on hermyour floor tonight
To slumber in Your light
Let hermeus sleep with angels tonight
Can't even breathe without holding you tight

Trade my will against yours
Is something I'd rather say then do
I want to kick down some doors
For me to see through
But she believes in love
Makes this distance pass
She sees the dove
Makes me stay and not trespass

And you must be her arms around me now

I'll make you a promise
To bring her safe home

Blindside,"Put the knife in the table
Deck of cards fly across the room
This game has ended
Someone needs to die
'Cause I put my life on the table
But forgot the risk I assume
Now it's going down

Fell in love with the game
But I forgot your name
Go ahead, please fight me
'Cause I'm not scared
Though you stayed the same
I forgot from where I came

I put my life on this table
This is me and I'm lost for words
Now is it me who needs to die?

Go ahead, please fight me
'Cause I'm not scared
Though you stayed the same
I forgot from where I came

And we both stand tall on the table
You take me by the hand
And I grab you by the throat
And we come crashing down through the window
On the dirt ground below
And we wrestle in the mud
And the blood and the beer
Break my jaw
I don't care
Just stay with me, stay

Lock my arms
I don't want to move
Hold me still
Teach me how to weep
If it's okay with you I think I'll stay here
For a little while

Blindside,"We are the sons and daughters of a revolution, 
Revolutionaries walking us out of oppression 
And into a no-low promise land.

And this is leaves us with a great sense of sadness 
Dwelling inside our soul. 
No one can explain where it's coming from 
Or where its taking us. 

We just know that something is lost, 
But somehow we are lost, lost

And this my friend, is the great depression",The Great Depression,2005
Blindside,"My feet felt light for the first time in months
It was like you came walking across the room
Straight at me and then straight through me
And then stopped and stood still for awhile
I knew then that i'd been lonely for quite some time
And as we started to dance you gently took off my tear soaked coat
And let it fall heavy to the floor and then
We danced some more

When all is said and done
When all is gone and still just begun
I will be asked what i did with my time and why
Can you be my alibi
Cause i know i spent it dancing with you

I have been here before
These emotions are relived
It's like a joy deja vu
You have been walking along
With me for quite some time
But me with my deaf ear and blind sides
Both of these i turned against you
We all know that you're there
We all know

When all is said and done
When all is gone and still just begun
I will be asked what i did with my time and why
Can you be my alibi

I'm out of shape tonight
Pinhole black velvet
Navigation-skills got lost with the fading light
It was there not more then a second ago
Now what do you know, what I do know
Is just not good enough to make things right
Put back the stars
I'm out of place tonight

Ain't it something to know your lost

I hoist my sail
Through there is no wind in sight
And I close my eyes to feel the fresh breeze
Paint the inside of my eyelids bright

Cause you know I'm out of mine
Let the sky burn and I will inhale
Without a fight

Until it hurts and I'll know it stings

One nation under attack

Blindside,"All seems wasted now you comb your hair
While your eyes search for a backdoor to get out
All you could do was to leave your deeds at the door
As you entered this room of sickness and doubt
But I saw you put down the memories in your coat just before
Now you want to drink but need someone to pour
To pour your heart out

This time
You know this is real
When you're scared to reveal
This time
Could you leave this now
Even if you knew how
This time
Looking over your shoulder
You have become older
This time
Are you afraid to die

With nothing left the pressure is off
To become all you needed to survive
With a color black you would not be blessed
In a church that decides on color and puts a price
On a paradise you now seem to know so well
But I know
I see Jesus in your eye, so kiss the sky and leave this now
Now I have seen what grace looks like

You know this is real
When you're scared to reveal

We had an intimate talk
With god you and I
Me with my words and you in silence

I like that

When you have nothing more to reveal

Blindside,"These streets are as cold and wet
As my eyes, flesh and bones are longing home
I was taken out of context
And to think you had me not speaking for a month or two
But it's not you I know
It's just me waiting
Waiting for the sun to come out

We are to follow
What if I could stand still and get moved

We are to follow
We are nothing running blind
We are to follow
We are so sick of it now
We are to follow
But I'm scared to be left behind
We are to follow
Nothing now

The tv dies more and more for each day
And the beauty of your eyes (in my hand)
Makes the flashing lights behind me on the wall look even more pale
Four o'clock and the sky is getting red
And here I am, just me waiting
Waiting for the sun to come out

Blindside,"That boy is gone
Sometimes I miss the way he wept at night
To be still and not run
To be rocked to sleep in your light
These days there is not much that will bring tears to my eyes
But when I remember who I am and who you are
When I remember
A cloud moves in, rain falls, thunder strikes, and sunshine breaks through the clouds

I am walking blind
So distracted that I don't even feel when you hold me
When did I grow such thick skin
You are my sunshine and rain
My joy and sweet pain
I'm a spotless stain
That boy is gone
But nobody moves me like you do
When I remember

A cloud moves in, rain falls, thunder strikes
And sunshine breaks through the clouds
I can cry out of sorrow and joy
Every drop of rain turns into a crystal in the sun
So wash my eyes, my clothes, my skin, my bones, my soul
My feet, my love
I'm not forgotten
I'm in your thoughts cause I feel sunshine in the rain

Nobody
Nobody moves me like you do",When I Remember,2005

Puts down the phone, neck suddenly stale
It's just another night with a sad different song
Heard from somewhere now she sings along
Turn the car-key, back out of the driveway
He sees her face and he closes his eyes
She still believes the lies

Pretty pretty eyes with a darker tone
Another hour in front of the mirror now all the cars are shown
They say lets have another toast lets sing another song
She tries but the vine is bitter and the words wrong
She still believe the lies

And it makes you blind
You must be bleeding under your eyelids tonight
You wait for something to break the mold
And all i can do is wipe the blood from your eyes

One tear in the sink, swallow the next one
Now out of sight but not really gone

Hang on the handle for a second or two
As the door opens i feel your sadness from across the room
And now for your beauty I'm lost for words

And I will wait by the telephone
While the silence pressures my eardrum
I found a black and white with a person smiling sad at me
Now I know can't get back that photograph once it's been seen

Promise you won't let me fall asleep never to wake up
Til my breath is gone don't let the color of my eyes fade
Promise you will find a way through the night while the angels cry
You color your heart blood red love does not fade away 

Can't give back that photograph once it's been signed
And I can't stop thinking about your voice
Now it's keeping me up at night
I found myself on a black and white staring back at me
Now I know, can't get back that photograph
It just needs color

Promise you won't let me fall asleep never to wake up
Til my breath is gone don't let the color of my eyes fade
Promise you will find a way through the night while the angels cry
You color your heart blood red love does not fade away

Blood-drop on that black and white
Is the only thing that can colorize these non-colored eyes

Promise you won't let me fall asleep never to wake up
Til my breath is gone don't let the color of my eyes fade
Promise you will find a way through the night while the angels cry
You color your heart blood red love does not fade

Blindside,"Pace is picking up
Tempo changing slowly gradually hardly noticeable
One beat per minute becomes two and two makes four
Now where is that door

To reality check me out and in and out of this motel rooms
It's unbelievable is this retrievable
I think I better leave

Pretty nights flashing photo lights
I feel all right as long as smiles are shining bright
What a game what a night
I feel all right I said
Pretty nights pretty nights but got nothing to say

Who touched the volume knob
Has it always been this loud
Allowed it to go from one
Does this one go to eleven
I think I better leave

Nothing is silent except the thoughts in my head
And all those words have been said
Feels unbelievable are they retrievable
Because all I do is scream to overpower this noise

Pretty nights flashing photo lights
I feel all right as long as smiles are shining bright
What a game what a night
I feel all right I said
Pretty nights pretty nights but got nothing to say

Pace is picking up tempo changing the common normal
Normalized us and paralyzed us and left us with a sadness
And now it's hovering in the air in between our eyes
I know we can find our way around
Around if we can only find the time
Time we don't have but that has been given

Pretty nights flashing photo lights
I feel all right as long as smiles are shining bright
What a game what a night
I feel all right I said
Pretty nights pretty nights but got nothing to say

Hey what a day, gone for the night and then
Run back home and tuck yourself in for a needed sleep
For another work-week, what a day what a day
Then wake up, oh no, sunset, I missed another day
One slap on the cheek and out the door
Running and running and coming closer to stumbling
If you run with a knife, you fall.
You stick a hole in that bubble called life
But my weapon is clean and I'm ready to go
Run nicotine, caffeine through my veins
To wake up, catch up, but it seems like

Ohhh.. I've been living in slow motion
I've been living in slow motion

Hold your breath and count to three
Not me, I've got to see what's around the corner ok
One two three... I've got to have air
Stumbling around spinning the disco ball faster
More of everything
It smells like burning rubber under my shoes
But I'm always one step behind, one minute too late
Hey operator, could you connect me with a respirator
I'm running after life like a dog on a leech
But life keeps slipping away

Ohhh.. I've been living in slow motion
I've been living in slow motion

We make it a hard synchronize
Stuck stuck stuck stuck in the lies you better
Leave leave because so many times
I run 50 miles an hour and I get sick sick sick
Wait wait I can't hold your breath
Stay stay won't let you go away
I'll stay and sleep with the lions
If you say you won't go away

How does it feel man
Hold steady
Is she ready
Does she like it dancing on the broken glass

One hand on the waist while the other, knuckles turning white
Are you holding on for dear life or does she not know how to let go

Where are hers
And see I'm wearing my shoes

Everybody has to dance

In this little place that we passed through,
You had your head turned away, but I knew,
You were smiling 'cause you always do.
Carrot cake in the afternoon,
And the sun in gleaming through the cream on the spoon,
Just me and you and you and me,
In a little mad hat
Down by the sea.

You thought the birds that flew above were stars,
But they were only birds.
Stars don't fly in the day,
Not where I come from anyway.
Just me and you and you and me
And you and me and a cacophony of angels,
All taking turns at singing tunes,
With those little mad wings
In the afternoon.

And looked at the sea,
And the sea was our friend,
So was everything.

And wrap it up in tinfoil,
With little ribbons and tinsel and say,
""That was a happy day"".

Do you want to come to a party
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party

And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard

Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun

The shadow in the background of the morgue

The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news

And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old

I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more

Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one

It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay

Bliss,"Would you like to look at some photos of my life
Spend some time as I recollect this passing by
You gave to me your open arm held me for a while
You called yourself a gentleman as I remember

I want to find like you somewhere close to light
I want to find like you somewhere close inside

And in my dream there you were telling me you were really broken
And how long it has taken you to come and see me here
And I saw you you were there suspended in time
High in the sky waiting all the while smiling down

I want to find like you, somewhere close to light
I want to feel like you, somewhere close inside

Dig beats deep as a creek and speak sonic
The waves I'm making capsize canoes
You can bathe in the wake to baptize your crew

To a gumtree swing for the hot sun
Where we fish off the dock with a shotgun
And a BMX track out the back not givin' a shit with a pig on the spit
And you can bet your bottom dollar there's a bong or two
We got the backyard lookin' like Taronga zoo
With a fluro skyline, bats in the distance
Fact is you won't catch Max doin' dishes
We got an AK, shooting clay pigeons
And Izm on the decks bangin' Gravediggaz
And if the cops come and stop the beat
That's when I let a pack of Ridgebacks off the leash

Ump the body count and let off spare rounds
And don't hurt no one, and don't touch my perso punk,

From meeting ozone in L.A in 85'
From my attempts to try and step on stage and rhyme
To my beyond 2005' state of mind
From a copy of a culture, ta teaching a tradition
From electric buguloo, to the beat that keeps my rhythm
From, wonderin' the tracks, ta the mic that's in my hand
From, wantin' to be black, to lovin who I am
From not known where your from, to the image of Sydney
From no one knowin' hip-hop, to kids thinkin' their 50
From the dramas on film, to the dramas of life
From posh clothes, to not knowin' they were half of the price
And from thinking to be king, you gotta have wealth
Ta the inner revolution i call knowledge itself
So from back ""then till now"" I still rap for the pleasure
Bein' rich or poor man, I'm still happy as ever

You gotta understand me
(You gotta understand me)
I gotta understand you
(I gotta understand you
so we can stand together recognize the vision,
its one love, one life, sets aside our differences
You gotta understand me
(You gotta understand me)
I got to understand you, 
cause that's what gets me by, in my life

From a part of the Bronx, to the heart of the burbs
From a dyslexic, to a artist of words
From a wild child, to my parents trynna steady me
From taken my parking cue, to givin' me heave ""D""
From mimicking thugs, thinking the lyrics with dope
To getting no satisfaction cause it was mirrors of smoke
From a home of hip-hop, to a land owned by rock
From rhyming to my mirror, to thousands blowin' the spot
But through all of the cheers, and the boo and the beers
Was just a kid on the bus, headphones glued to his hears
Who just grew through the years, to sewer the tears
The blood and sweat makes somethin' with his crew and his peers
See it was hip-hop that put three lost souls on a map
From showin us the country, to puttin clothes on our back
And from finding myself, in my mic's reflection
To this musical marriage that gave my life direction

You gotta understand me
(You gotta understand me)
I gotta understand you
(I gotta understand you
so we can stand together recognize the vision
Its one love, one life, sets aside our differences
You gotta understand me
(You gotta understand me)
I got to understand you, 
Cause that's what gets me by, in my life

From a major label deal, to bustin' on the street
Knowing souls were for sale, when I'm fuckin' with these beats
The landlord of these lyrics, with a touch of what can be
And if it doesn't ground, You could trust it wasn't me
The deepest of minds, can't frame what I've imagined
Three eyes on the train, writin' rhymes on a napkin
See these kids don't have bentley's, they sit and take the bus
But if ya playin' this tape, ya situation's sussed
From backstage butterfly's to a passion of a debut
From not haven a path, to push past and a way through
From this rhyming release, to stress I've got off my chest
From chasing a dream, to holding the hart of the press
From shoe store days, to writing sessions at night
To a culture that ultimately taught me lessons in life
So from back ""then till now"" I still rap for the pleasure
Bein' rich or poor man I'm still happy as ever

And we won't stop until we get that feeling
That's why we get on up that's why we got on up
Oh we won't stop until we get that feeling
That's why we get on up (Hang on, hang on, hang on)

I gotta understand you
(I gotta understand you

It pumps through my brain, through my name, nothing will change
Don't make me huff and puff and turn this f**ker to flames
But enough of the games, my shadow is a tidal wave
My idle, there's a brighter way, fight for it night and day
I've built fires inspired to keep my hands warm
I've hopped through hurricanes
Step-step through sandstorms
I've climbed cliffs, you can see what I'm dreaming
Even walked on water, just to be here this evening
So, here we go again, I gotta prove I'm no magician to you
Rabbit in a hat, rappers is clueless how I kick it
This is blood, sweat and tears
Flesh and bone a better way
A brotherhood of hope, with a megaphone at heavens gate

Shoot me down, raise my head
Walk my field of dreams instead
Cause' there's no way, you will march on top of me
Not how this is going to be be

Lift my feet, raise my head
Love and sweat and tears I've bled
Create the path I see ahead

So I guess I gotta

Walk my way instead

Yeah, check it out, yo

Well he's still kickin' it so beautifully
Bet he's re-writing the odds
Cause he knows it's not the dog in the fight
But the fight in the dog
And the kid couldn't spell for shit
But could draw like a photograph
F**k a hit, he rather his rhyme on the wall of a poets class
Caught a flow and wrote the flavor that archaeologists artists audio appropriator
Ghost rider, flaming chopper, caressing the night
Chasing the glimpse of a forever fading florescent horizon
He just lights up the skies (lights up the skies)
While running through this circus
With the heart full of good vibes (heart full of good vibes)
That's pumping through his circuits
Live wire, high flyer
Spit fire round his lungs
A war torn mustang, through an empire of the sun
Catch him diving in his rhythm
Rhyme and gliding in his vision
Manifest music mementoes to remind him of his mission
He just rolls like a bowler
A soldiers forward composure
With butterfly net full of dreams hangin' over his shoulder he says

Shoot me down, raise my head
Walk my field of dreams instead
Cause there's no way, you will march on top of me
Not how this is going to be

Lift my feet, raise my head
Love and sweat and tears I've bled
Create the path I see ahead

So I guess I gotta

Walk my way instead

Shoot me down, raise my head

While the burgs are melting and the sea is rising I don't know so I ask them why
Yeah, why are they refusing to listen
Why are these troops on a mission
And why are they shooting these victims over their view on religion
Yeah why do we all search for love like we got cupids addiction
Why with politicians you can't tell the truth from the fiction
Why do we pollute where were living
Why are these youth put at risk
And why is this fool on dominion kept us consumed in this prison
I won't jump through the hoops of this system
Nothing stands between you and the pursuit of your vision
I grab a loop of this rhythm it's puts the juice in my pistons
So jump back, react spit in the boots with precision
When I'm cruising with ism' yeah I'm doosing the splif
It's a BNE show bitch getting loose was a given
I don't want them to look back when the future was written
And know we killed ourselves with nuclear vision and stupid decisions
Shit I'd rather an asteroid due for collision then know the planet got fucked by the human condition
Sing the tune with conviction!

That cosmic cowboy that doesn't care what they think
Real magic isn't card tricks big cribs and cars bitch
It's making something out of nothing through this hardship
And even though we know that the earth is weak
We still bomb each other and idol what the churches speak
It's like this land is either run by Labour or Liberal
But don't get entwisted their the same as the criminals
Open your eyes simply notice the issue
That we stuck to our guns without promoting the pistol
We only orchestrated the sound that we all love
Split because of colour but bound because of blood
So before we all blow and they sell the scene
Know that the only thing that's bullet proof is my self esteem
See this is way beyond cash, and ego tripping it's an epic electric eso ecosystem
Grow with me!

Everybody knows things are bad
Pollutions recognize the icecaps are melting quick
Kids trust no one and why else would they
The air is unfit to breathe, our food is unfit to eat
It's an inferno land, pollutions recognize the icecaps are melting quick
Fuck all that shit, we are here together in this country as one
As fucking one!
It's all about peace, love and unity

Then changed the whole game like what have I done
At the gutter I come to touch the bright sun
And from the highest heights

There no telling what there selling
When there's sheep in the sky
Keep this is mind I keep all my crimes
I do it when I wanna do it

Explosive ferocious get up and down that's show biz
Power to the people that have freedom in their focus
I hope this helps you when your under the thumb
Feel like nothing can save you
When feel like jumping the gun
Stop relax and remember even in the first weather
You'll find a way cross there be brighter days honest

Forget what you been taught and show these people how you feel like

To all my beach bombers each summer holdin it down
Were the free runners feet hover over the town
Raft up at the marina - leisure and pleasure
Float and bash of boats, all tethered together
Good times, laid back, and out on the free range
Easy going folks bring about a sea change
Starlit sky - high above the land
Beach lights burn campfires in the sand
Hear the acoustics let the tune touch me
Under the moon kids cane dune buggies,
BMX Bandits that ride through the calm breeze
Skateboard wheels glide through the palm trees
What a paradise look around clockwise
From Bell's beach round to boogie down Bondi
Surfers ride right through life's two
A nice view when the sky uses bright blue

With my folk on a Fridays,
Soak in the light rays,
Carolina, blue sky,
Coast on the highway.
On track, fired up and steam-powered,
Never listen to the dream-doubters at the bean counters,
Join the mental, consequential song writer

It's drifting off to the sound of rain
It's getting up kicking goals in the morning
It's lifting off from the ground with your flame
It's the strength with stand life lessons
It's the clock as the hands strike seconds
It's my movie where every memory is a colour I collect to expand my spectrum.

It's the simple days
Childhood here and now then it's gone in a instant
Back when the wall around my world was a little too high to see beyond in the distance
It's the smell of the mint in my fresh grass
A little league in the time that I'm so free
It's snow days

And I remember those days with my dad
In the great outdoors getting raised by the land
Not knowing how hard life gets
Call me huckleberry when I start my quest
So jump on my cloud, sit back and lounge
My wings are the size of a rich rappers house
I'll never leave so picture a viking who's 
Memory is like christian the Lion

Take cover cause' we nearly burnt down the house
I remember when they took away my wutang
Sittin' there till the bell of my school rang
Playing pool on the pool where the rules are abused
My adventure to the centre where the youth hang
And grandma's we'd visit every journey
A living room stage where id mimic Eddie Murphy

Grown from school days the outcast from the in crowd
I keep my chin down as time flies and seasons vanish
Hold the self belief to manage grip and seize my canvas
Paint the color that connects with me and speaks my language
Try to release my baggage be free to relieve the anguish
When it's freezing cold feel the warmth between my toes of this earth I walk
Creation is what feeds my soul
It can ease the load climbing on the steepest 
Road so I preach this ode to remind myself to keep control
When it's all too much and I dive to free fall 
I try to center myself on the center of life's see-saw
I crave the fun times the sunshine entices
Of wandering temptation and unwind my vices
From the drugs to the girls and the beers 
I'm drinking and remember what's at staking staring in the mirror thinking

Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun 
Till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh (eso) yeah

It's the hunt for the high the people 
I've met the places I've seen (oh)
The stories I've told the forks in the road chasing my dream (woah)

On the brink stop and think 
I'm telling you dreams don't cost a thing 
I know we all die alone but I feel faith within that cosmic link
I surf the starlight where every wish is worthy
Only happy when you've got it often makes you miss the journey
Coincide with chemistry
Flow and ride my energy
We'll grow our grass greener than that other side will ever be
The man on the mic the rose on my drum kit
Happy with my reflection even though I've done dumb shit
And sometimes I think of stuff keen to get that instant rush
Fiending for that pick me up that; s probably why I drink too much
It's not the feeling of the high when you're running round
It's the friends that you find when you're coming down
From smooth sailing to foggy rocky roads 
I won't be faked by my reflection like that dog that dropped his bone

Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride

I can do this, I can do that
I can make myself break out of the track
But thinking I can't do jack
Now the only thing I can't do is hold back
I can globe trot across the whole map
Rock a show, make the whole world soul clap
I can snap shots with my Kodak
Spiral the hydro blow back, machine gun funk
I can smoke a whole rain forest in a blunt
I can space travel when I got it in my lung
Clouds, step planets, spitting hotter than the sun
Faster than a bullet from a gun
With the logic of tongue, squashing beef before any killings done
I can chill on one, blood on a vibe
Talking to the earth mother,
Now I'm on the other side
Stare God in the eye till my vision is blind
'Cause the sun is the God and the wisdom is the light

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I don't have to join an army to be all that I can be
I can call it how I see, I can exercise free speech
I can walk the beach with the fresh sky sea breeze
I can track my path in the sand through my footprints
I can capture life's garden in a books ink
They pin us with the cruel thumb of fear
But I can see their game and the truths coming clear
I can feel the rain like cool summer tears
And I can come back in a few hundred years
Look at our track record, our favourite high achievers
The common thread is, I can all bright believers
I can hurdle every single obstacle
With training, man your optimal
And anything is possible

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

We can send people into space
And use laughter as medicine
And drop bombs behind the mask of a president
I can see through the lies of the government
I can hit rock bottom and then pick my self up again
I can free myself from being tied up in prison
I can go the distance
I can mind fuck the system
I can pick the lock
Crack the code, ship this off, stack the load
You can find me on a misty dock packing cones
But I'm high without the pleasures of a drug
And I can change my girls mood with a gesture of my love
I can master my courage to fight another day
I can bend that spoon that tried to run away
I can tame the rage of a cage full of primates
I can spit with Jehst
And put the H in the right place
So, I guess it's safe to say now
I can fall down the rabbit hole and make my way out

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that

On top of the tour bus in a teen wolf mask, surfin' USA
And we got that baggage packed, happy gas, glasser traps
Yes, I can dig it
So I joke like tom on a josh, baskin' in these tours like a big kid
It's my habitat, I can't leave the trees like an orangutang
I'm a runnin' on air anchorman and I never land like bangarang

Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?

Yo, I'm actin a fool
No shame, I came, I shat in the pool
Yeah, better pass that blunt

She'll tell ya, I'm psycho mate, my ideas make your lightbulbs break
I'll make it look so damn easy, when I rock that Borat mankini
Fuck what they say, you don't miss your chance
To eat chocolate cake, with your hands, you rock a bubble beard
While you're takin a bath where a simple fart still makes you laugh like

Hahahaha, blurp blurp, hahaha
And then a big brown shark came

Now I'm on the stage, actin' up
Yeah, the bombs away while I grab my nuts
You're livin it, like it's all the movies
Still killin' shit on Call of Duty
And I still think, I can move like the Matrix, real shit
Shroomin' in Vegas, or when I play with my dogs
Even right now while I'm makin this song
So how's about it? Let's laugh til there's power outage
That's all that I have to say
Fuck them all and don't act your age, I'm makin pancakes

Bliss N Eso,"Come along children
Now we're going to have a little music
Like old times

Straight out the gate
This is our story we're scripting
Our film, our glorious vision
Our sound, our score that is written
In this sport, This division
My my, how the tournament's risen
Shit, everybody wants to soar in an instant
Everybody wants to be the Lord of the Ring wins
We laid dormant and listened
Hit ignition
Tore up the system
Elevate, accelerate and demonstrate
Live the dream and keep the horns to the mission
The formula's mixing
To fire the engine up and bring the force to the pistons
Never say never
Whenever together we give and go with the flow flipping like Jordan and Pippen
Slam the points home
Insight a war to ignite the board
Wipe the floor with the notes that we write
And hold down with a mic to strike a chord
And then they can hear that thunder with the hooves
When we come with the hunger of the wolves
They were warned and the red flag flew
And his crewed cracked through
It's the running of the bulls

Today, we are together
Whenever we come together
The writers write
The cameras roll
Because together we got power
That's just it

I said ay yo, I'mma lay my tracks down
I'm that freight train tearing through the sky in the clouds
I said ay yo, watch this hail mary fly

Yeah, welcome to the time of my life
I'm sky high, I'm sky high, yeah, welcome to the time of my life

Sun, rain, snow or hail, we never got lost in the storm
And you best to respect that you never really know what you've got 'til it's gone
And a monster was born, with a want to explore
Life's roughest weather, but we know the code so we stuck together, yeah
And as life unravels, my mind's what fights my battles
I rhyme like lightning travels, think quick, how you like them apples
'Cause I'm ready as I'll ever be, my head is in the melody, I'm flying now
Each feather is so heavenly, the energy of seven seas couldn't tie me down, bitch
So no fucking around dumb cunt, one jump and I'm up in the clouds
Trying to make that moment last, on a beat like Heath in a Joker mask
Which means, don' change that dial
Could've, would've, should've, just ain't our style
Shit, we got things to build
If your luck's low just know your wings are real

I keep a dime piece in arm's reach

I used to run with a lot of crime lords
Ramadan taught me use my mind more
Though I'm not religious
Nas y'all, just the realist
My imminent, conspicuous, synonym, sincere, rhyme and flow
Developed some images up in your mind bro
I survived continuing criminal enterprises that surrounded me
Innocent, no exaggeration
I don't pimp my past, I don't brag, no faking
My apartment had some break-ins
I'm thinking my past is worse than today is
That's when Biz Mark came with the vapors
It was anarchy, live in a heartbeat
Of the city that never sleeps
Niggas will gas you up to handle their beef
Peep game, you're dead if you don't think fast enough
We keeping it way street

Pump this tape in the deck, place the key in ignition
We won't wait in the red light, only green's in my vision
Yeah, journey to the mind again, all aboard the brain
These feathers make me levitate in waterfalls of pain
Keep your fortune and your fame, mate, I'm chillin' on a tree branch
Laughin' at the squares drawin' perfect circles free-hand
We kill the doubt, the path, the vine is limitless
My rhyme is the reason that they can't define the pyramids
Travel at the speed of light with Ceekay Jones,
With full faith of where this freeway goes
A spectrum of colors, it's like our time
Has come to ride high til we fly through that rising sun

Baby, it's a new day,

When I wake each day, it's like a new timeless moment
The chance to steer you dry as soon as your eyelids open
I push back the path that tipped the scales
And made it to the sea in time to catch my shipped had sailed
Played the game my way, with my mind in the zone like Michael
Recite my diary like I'm flying on a motorcycle
The easy rider on that road that stretches nations,
Life's speeding up and all I feel's acceleration with that wind in my face
And I got that past in my back, and I got the prize in my eyes,
And I got my passion intact
So I ride through the night and dream bright into the cosmos
Now all I see is green lights at every crossroads

Baby, it's a new day, drivin' on the through way,
All I see is bright green lights
Forget what you were coming,

Bliss N Eso,"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor 
That's not my business
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone, if possible
Jew, Gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another 
Human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness  
Not by each other's misery
We don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there is room for everyone
And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned man's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, 
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed

We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynical 
Our cleverness, hard and unkind 
We think too much and feel too little
More than machinery we need humanity 
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men  
Cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world  
Millions of despairing men, women, and little children -
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people

To those who can hear me, I say do not despair
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed  
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, 
And the power they took from the people will return to the people
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish

Soldiers!
Don't give yourselves to brutes
Men who despise you, enslave you  
Who regiment your lives, tell you what to do 
What to think and what to feel! 
Who drill you, diet you
Treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men  
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines!
You are not cattle!
You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!
You don't hate!
Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural
Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th chapter of St Luke it is written: 
“The Kingdom of God is within man” 
Not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you!
You, the people have the power, the power to create machines 
The power to create happiness!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful 
To make this life a wonderful adventure

Then, in the name of democracy 
Let us use that power, let us all unite!",Unite,2013

You can see I'm blessed, but not me being self-abusive
If you can see my success, but not the wife that got me through it

Lead to us grabbing toasters, shoot to kill when they approach us
Instantly tag us, no respect when they bag us

Throw us on the wall, feeling niggas up like they faggots
Hit you where it hurt, kick in ya door
You on the floor, they up ya wifey skirt lookin for raw
What is it for? Just for doing dirt tryin to score

Blitzen Trapper,"It was just a little while past the Sunset Strip
They found the girl's body in an open pit
Her mouth was sewn shut, but her eyes were still wide
Gazing through the fog to the other side

They booked me on a whim and threw me deep in jail 
With no bail, sitting silent on a rusty pail
Just gazing at the marks on the opposite wall
Remembering the music of my lover's call

So you make no mistake
I know just what it takes
To pull a man's soul back from heaven's gates
I've been wandering in the dark about as long as sin
But they say it's never too late to start again

Oh when, oh when
Will the spirit come a-callin' for my soul to send
Oh when, oh when
Will the keys to the kingdom be mine again?

It was dark as the grave, it was just about three
When the warden with his key came to set me free
They gave me five dollars and a secondhand suit
A pistol and a hat and a worn out flute

So I took a bus down to the Rio Grande 
And I shot a man down on the edge of town
Then I stole me a horse and I rode it around
'Til the sheriff pulled me in and sat me down

He said, you make no mistake
I know just what it takes
To pull a man's soul back from heaven's gates
I've been wandering in the dark about as long as sin
But they say it's never too late to start again

Oh when, oh when
Will the spirit come a-callin' for my soul to send
Oh when, oh when 
Will the keys to the kingdom be mine again?

Well the sheriff let me go with a knife and a song
So I took the first train up to Oregon
And I killed the first man that I came upon
'Cause the devil works quick, you know it don't take long

Then I went to the river for to take a swim
You know that black river water is as black as sin
And I washed myself clean as a newborn babe
And then I picked up a rock for to sharpen my blade

Oh when, oh when
Will the spirit come a calling for my soul to send

Blitzen Trapper,"Yeah, when I was only 17
I could hear the angels whispering
So I droned into the words and wondered aimlessly about
Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
It turned out to be the howling of a dog
Or a wolf to be exact
The sound sent shivers down my back
But I was drawn into the pack and before long 
They allowed me to join in and sing their song
So from the cliffs and highest hill
Yeah, we would gladly get our fill
Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah
And my thoughts, they surely were 
Turned to instinct and obedience to God

You can wear your fur

If your makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe
I'm like fuel on a fire
So if you're gonna' get made
Don't be afraid of what you've learned

On the day that I turned 23
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
When suddenly a girl, her skin the color of a pearl
She wandered aimlessly but she couldn't seem to see
She was listenin' for the angels just like me
So I stood and looked about
I brushed the leaves off of my snout
And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
So I took her by the arm
We settled down upon a farm
And raised our children up as gently as you please

And now my fur has turned to skin
And I've been quickly ushered in
To a world that I confess I do not know
But I still dream of running careless through the snow
And through the howlin' winds that blow
Across the ancient distant flow
And fill our bodies up like water till we know

But you can wear your fur
Like the river on fire
But you better be sure

With your grapes and bottled rain,
Make your wine of my worship of divinely strange refrain

They disappear.

She found me down in a lonely place
She dug me out with an old jaw bone
She dressed me up for to take me home
She fed me words that I could not taste,
For I had no tongue, it had been replaced
By a green and a growing flower which grew
And I knew if I ever spoke, I would speak true

We lived together in an old hotel
A broke-down palace with a wishing well
The neighbor girl taught me how to spell
And how to steal what I could not sell
But I fed my tongue on the Devil's rum
In a roadhouse run by a godless bum
On a drunken night, with a stolen gun
I shot my lover as she made to run
The judge said, 'Son, what have you done?'
But I didn't speak a word, no I didn't speak one
And the judge sent me away
And they buried my Grace, yeah, the very next day

In the rain, rolling down through the dusty plain

Silver stars pinned on every one
They busted my mouth for to get at my tongue
To see just how this had all begun
So I opened my mouth like a dragon's breath
I only spoke truth, but it only brought death
And I laid those boys to rest
For the truth, in truth, is a terrible jest

For there ain't no road but the road to home,
There ain't no crops but the ones you've sown
And if you learn one thing from me
You better guard your tongue like your enemy

On the western rim where the sun goes down
Where a branded man might start again

'Cause I love the way you walk away

I spent the night in an old Sedan
It was parked by the river where the oak tree stands
Try to find a station on that radio
Searchin' hard for a song that I just don't know
Some kind of person with a different need
But all I heard was the stars as they spoke to me
Ain't too tough, speakin' loud and true

Telling me all the ways that I'm losing you

Like a dog hidin out underneath the step
Burnin' this bridge, cause I need the light
For the see my way through the coming night
Guessin' that you'd always just play the game
Come a walkin' on back down the same ole lane
Bu the grass grows high all around your door
It's a sign or symbol for the things in store

It flows far but never nearer to my home
And the war is upon the shores
Keep the single girls indoors
And so all my love songs fall on wasted ears

I grow tired of this highway
It runs far but never my way
Don't you know, but the company of strangers
And the close and the present dangers
Seem to pick me up like an old crow in the snow

Because I'm a stranger in a strange land
Guess I left the world behind
Yeah my love is like the galaxy seems slow 
But it sure does shine and when I'm gone you'll know me by

Yourself a stranger in a stranger place
With your beat up shoes and an old suitcase
And a wristwatch that don't ever seem to tell the time
But there's a warm and a gentle feeling

It ain't ever worth concealing what you see
And the rains inside my brains 
Keeps the memories contained
But I miss you like the wind misses the trees

And I drove to the top of the hill
I took my gun and I shot down the sun
But the sun it ain't so easy to kill
So I pushed out my skis, left my lady in the trees
Started swingin' like an old-time saloon
Had an all-day kickdown dragout fight
With the sun and his brother the moon

So daddy don't you stop but daddy don't you sleep

Thinkin' maybe I should call it a day
Till I heard the rooster call sittin' up on the wall
I guess he had him something to say
So I wandered all around in the mountains in the dark
Gettin' silly by the light of the moon
For the sun had gone away, guess I whipped him anyway

She was standing out by my car
I said I thought you moved to the city girl
No one never did find the time I’ve been wasting away, at my sister’s place
Just North of the county line

Well I gazed out across the gravel line
To the road that leads to town
Thinking all the ways that I broke your heart
Yeah, thinking how it all went down

I never loved right by you

So we go up to the turn-pipe
Where the whole world turns to sky
