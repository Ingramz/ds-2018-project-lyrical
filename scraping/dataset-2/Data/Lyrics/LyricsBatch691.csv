Mary J. Blige,"Mya you know the hook,
you see the bait, 
I know you want a bite,
So why procrastinate,
Come on.

Everybody knows that yeah I'm kind of shy,
I'm not the kind of girl that who can ever approach a guy,
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me, 

I got a 4 wheel drive, 55, from eyes
but maybe you can handle these because I'm Free.

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.

When I told you that I don't need a man in my life that ties me down,
And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town.
Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat,
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5, 
who's shy that's the kind of man I need because I'm free.

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.
Single, Sexy making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.

If your having a good time, just let go and don't be shy, come on yeah(oh yeah)
If your down to do anything let's sing this song together, 
Be free, come on and be free with me.

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.

Would you like to dance? Get loose,
There's a party in the house tonight,
Everybody if you feel all right,
Put your hands together.

Oh boy you look so good to me

Mary J. Blige,"I wanna dedicate this song
To all the women, all over the world
That have to still deal with this issue
You know I've been there too
I had to deal with it with you
But come on now ladies, how many times he got to say her name?
Listen...

Verse 1:
You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself
This man has no respect for me
I knew it all along 'cause you were talking in your sleep

Hook:
It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

Chorus:
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
'cause I'm through with you
(repeat twice)
I heard you...

Verse 2:
What you were sayin in your sleep
It violated me
No doubt about it
But there's nothing left for you and me
Because your busted
And I might as well go on
Boy it's gonna take a long time
To make this a happy home
You know..

HOOK:
It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

Chorus:
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
'cause I'm through with you
(repeat twice)
I heard you...

Bride:
All you had to say is
I don't wanna be with you but
Don't you tell the truth now
I already have the proof and
It'll never be the same you
Know its a kinda shame b/c
Now I am disgusted
You are so busted

Than America's number one hustler (Sean Carter)
Don't call it a come back
Unless there's some money attached to that
And you can call it whatever you like, in fact
It's something like a phenomenon
Like a young LeBron, gettin' my high school games on
TV just for dunkin' on
Whoever want it with Sean he can get it jumpin like Donkey Kong
We could get it thumpin' like bum-ba-bum
Travel the way of the gun, come on, see-come on
No, I'm not only beggin' I'm eggin' you on
Until you dead or gone that's the vendetta I'm on
This ain't no video game with wrestlers on it
The competitor on this is on some shit
Honest come through all black like a Amish
Holsters under the armpit, the arm spit, ha
Just that Brooklyn don shit
Along with the queen from Yonkers
Come on kiss the ring
Fore I let miss Mary sing
Supposed to you a soul in the everything, yeah
It's classic material
I see you bastards at the burial
Jay go first and then Mary go, round
I just ride, hold her down with the fifth by my side
Me and Miss Blige
Look up in the sky it's a bird and the 'caine
And the hydro flow that I brought to the game
I could go mo' but I'm a let ma do her thang
Brooklyn, we did it again

I can't really explain what it is about her

I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see you were my destiny.
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride.
I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.

Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best,
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination.

To get paid you got saved dont be spending the change, 
In 5th grade i was hustling my genesis games, 
I was dumb young, selling chewing gum to my classmates, 
On the cash chase, moving at a fast pace, 
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummys do, 
So I had to mill the bird before I turn twenty two, 
More money more problems is true, 
Cuz the more money I make the more problems for you,
Yeah I use dude voice, props to the boy sean, 
He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song, 
So stop drawn man you gotta respect it, 
I'm the best swizz got it perfected, 
Dont mess with C-A double S-I-D-Y, 
Cuz I became the best when B-I-G died,

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin' my time awakin, turnin' my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin'
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin' me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein' them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back,"" right right

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)
Evil plaguin' he rewardin'
Hate surrender (hate surrender)
Love exalted! (Love exalted!)
Hope elated! (hope elated!)
Negativity destroyed and..

[Will Smith]
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin' the last word
and why, did her uncles have to molest her
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the fuck can't love, seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say

[Chorus]

[Will Smith]
Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin' you crazy
But for me I try to see the button side
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin' to hide
or tryin' to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside

Mary J. Blige,"I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you 
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say ""I love you""
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
 
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop 
Oh my love, a million days in your arms 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
Never too much, never too much
Never too much, never too much
 
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning
 
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop

I need a real love Mary holler at me if you need a real thug
We could ride through Compton to see real blood, real crypts,
And I'm a always hold you down that's real shit
I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 what's crackin' what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess what I'm tryin' 2 say
Is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel
You paved the way for young black women of prosper
How you paint pictures
You deserve Grammies and Oscars

'91 I stepped in this game
After 'what's the 411' things ain't been the same
And I can't complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I been through

Go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

I came with 'share my world'
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Chorus]

You remind me
Of a real love
(you don't 'ave to worry)
Real love
All night long
I'm goin down

You are everything but without it baby

It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Time to choose my clothes, choose my friends, be with my family
They been asking, 'girlfriend, where you been? We, ain't seen you in weeks.'
Been chasing this fool around, thinking he gonna hold me down
I would follow his lead thinking I'm gonna be the one he keep around
What I needed (not your finance)
And all that I needed (real commitment)
I really couldn't see it (not a real man)
You said you be there (in this relationship)

For real

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You trippin' more
I'm tired of you playing
Got me lookin' at the front door missing
You're missing more to let you play me
Don't wanna play house no more, no more
I'm tired of you playing
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to do something for me

You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, gizeppi's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me
Cryin', cryin', cry, cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)

And that's when it hurt me so much to see her (To see her cry) 
Oh don't cry mum don't cry mum 
(Each and every night) 
We're gonna be alright 
That's what I used to say 
(I said that's okay)

Because we never had one at home 
No no no no 
As a little girl 
So I understand why daddy couldn't be there 
Cause it's so obvious no body taught him how to be a father either 
I'm not saying this to reminisce on the past 
I'm just saying this to make you understand that I need a father. 
And this is my problem this is why I couldn't keep no one this is why I couldn't stay alone I was so scared alone everyone needs daddy and 
I don't think she understands cause she really need a father the father in you my friend 

She really needed a father, the father in you 
When your wife is speaking fellas pay attention yeh 
Don't ignore her 
Oh I really need the father in you",Father in You,2005

Uh-huh

I need a real love Mary hollar at me if you need a real thug
We could ride through Compton to see real blood, real crypts,
And imma always hold you down that's real shit
I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 what's crackin' what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess what I'm tryin' 2 say
Is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel
You paved the way for young black women of prosper
How you paint pictures
You deserve Grammies and Oscars
Congratulation from me Aftermath and the ""Dr""
So you could go ahead envy me
I'm Billboards top ten featuring 'MJB'

'91 I stepped in this game
After 'what's the 411' things ain't been the same
And I can't complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I been through

Hate it or love it,
(The underdogs on top)

Go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

I came with 'share my world'
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldnt hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Chorus]

You remind me
Of a real love
(you don't 'ave to worry)
Real love
All night long
I'm goin down

Reminice on the love we have
You are everything but without it baby
What you gonna do without

All that a man should be
Put me on a flight if I wanna
Buy out the mall if I wanna

My personal UPS
I'm sending him an SOS
That I love him and I want him
And don't wanna replace him with nobody else

Yeah, and she someone I would work with, 
That's what I could tell from what she's showing on the surface.
I ain't saying that I'm requesting anyone 
That's perfect but I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it

I, I never thought I could feel so much like a lady

It's good to have doors open for me
By a real man, who wants to hold my hand
And he's not ashamed to be out in public with me
It's the simple things that really turn me on
Like being kind, being warm to me that makes a man look strong
And that's why I don't mind spending all my time with him

I feel so um um

When I'm with you when I'm round you 
When I'm with you when I'm round you
I, I never was the type

To wear high heels and all that stuff but now I even wear make-up
Because you make me feel like it's alright with you
So it's alright with me

Boy you changed my mind about this whole thing
So I cross my legs and sit up straight
I can wait for our next date

And I really love the new me 
And its because of you she's who I want to be

Your love's in 187 baby it's alright, it's alright
When we beefin' we ain' speakin'
Feels like I'm dyin' inside but it's alright
Forget the trials and tribulations you been through in your life
Come to me runnin' trust me baby I make it right

You with me lil' mama, let's breeze lil' mama
We start with a lil' bit and take it to a lotta that
Love gettin' hotter you can if you wanna
Have it all it's yours just ask and you got it

The trillion cuts, the Audi and Porsche trucks
I do these things for you 'cause you my done
Girl, feel special 'cause I don't spend
Nuttin' but time with certain other broads I rip

You belong in minks, bracelets and rings
Not handcuffs forget about that locket chain
And just leave lil' mama, this P lil' mama
I ain't them, I'm me lil' mama

My baby, you crazy and I'm hooked
Your body right, your smile light up the room
That man you got, that nigga's a fool
Guess one man's trash is the next man's jewel

This is no way to live
(It's alright)
But it's just the way it is
(It's alright)

You got to understand
(It's alright)
That I never could trust a man

But I got to let it go

And stop livin' in the past
(It's alright)

(It's alright)
And give you a chance
(It's alright)
Give you a chance

When we first middle sex fif, knew that you was that chick
Wooly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes

Hell, I just dipped her number and talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife

Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you

What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone
The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was
He like the 'Sold-a-soul' man, who the fuck you 'cause? I'm out

This is no way to live
(It's alright)
But it's just the way it is
(It's alright)

You got to understand
(It's alright)
That I never could trust a man
(It's alright)

But I got to let it go
(It's alright)
And stop livin' in the past
(It's alright)

(It's alright)
And give you a chance
(It's alright)
Give you a chance

Every time I hurt you it's because of what someone else
Has done to me and I know it's not really fair
No I just can't trust you 'cause I just got outta something
And I'm running, boy you know that I'm running scared

You treat me so good that it's just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should
'cause I been so hurt in the past I'm still carryin' bags

This is no way to live
(It's alright)
But it's just the way it is
(It's alright)

You got to understand

That I never could trust a man

And stop livin' in the past

And give you a chance
(It's alright)
Give you a chance

We can ball to the fullest baby
(It's alright, it's alright)
You can style if you want, go ahead stunt

If it's diamonds you like go ahead pick 'em up

I have read this book so many times
But nowhere can I find the page
That change what I experience today

Now I know that life is meant to be hard
That's how I learn to appreciate my God
Though my courage made me try
I can tell you I won't hide
Because the footprints show you are by my side

You can lie to a child with a smilin' face
Tell me that color ain't about race
You can cast the first stones, you can break my bones
But you're never gonna break 
You're never gonna break my faith

Faith and hope ain't yours to give
Truth and liberty are mine to live
You can steal a crown from a king
Break an angels wings
But you're never gonna break 
You're never gonna break my faith

My Lord
Won't you help them to understand
That when someone takes the life of an innocent man
Well, they never really won because all they've really done
Is set the soul free where it's supposed to be?

You can lie to a child with a smilin' face
Tell me that color ain't about race
You can cast the first stones, you can break my bones
But you're never gonna break 
You're never gonna break my faith

Yeah

You takin' a part of me 
That I cannot set free 
See me lettin' go 
No this ain't the time 
I got too much livin' to do 
And I can't lose it over you 
So give me the flow 
I'll get my swagger goin' 
I'll say this is the year for me 

You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 

Damn you been up and down the whole way
I know I make it hard to love me 
But trust me 
I could take you to places 
That you ain't never been 
Put you in purple labels 
And in Vera Wang
Get your name engraved 
On a wedding ring on everything
I'ma love you better 
More than I ever did 
Cause baby girl listen 
Since you been here with me 
Can't even lie 
I see the rider in ya ambition 
Providin' me with the fire 
When you wet and drippin' 
Mommy if you see it different 
Go 'head and get it 
And I ain't sayin' if you leave me 
It'd be better 
But me and you together 
Honey we could do whatever 
Let's do it 
I made it hard 
I admit it it's true 
I need to hear somethin' 
I'm listenin' boo 

So make sure I'm heard and things improve 
I'm prepared to take it there for you 
Your lovin' keeps me lovin' 
Saying no purpose constant chest pain
It's amazin' 
But it ain't enough 
Friends keep askin' 
I'm staying around
For what
Who sheds this many tears
Remind of where am I as to what it is
Oh oh oh

I know I'm hard to love 
Let's rock 

You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 

Lemme talk to you one more time girl 
You always sayin' that I don't want you to hurt 
You always complainin' 
But I was makin' it worse 
Besides all the games that I's kickin' at first 
It's time to explain 
My mind's been in reverse 
But now I think back 
When nobody cared 
And you was there 
Just to roll by your man 
And came back 
Even know what I did 
I realize and I'm aware 
I know what it is 
Put that on everything 
Girl you my everything 
I don't know where I'd breathe 
Cause you the air I be 
If lovin' is wrong 
Who could be right 
I wouldn't know what to do 
Without you in my life 
You're more to me than the world I pray 
The more nights for your heart to ache
Right in the middle of the dawn of day 
I think of all the pain I caused 
And throw it away and say 
I need you in my life 
Can you feel it in your soul 

You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 

I know it's hard to love me 
That don't mean I don't love you 
Hey rich 
I love the way you got Harlem singin' 
Mary take us home 

You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you

Last night,
I couldn't even get an answer.
Tried to call,
But my pride wouldn't let me dial.
And I'm sitting here,
With this blank expression.
And the way I feel,
I wanna curl up like a child.

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

[Keyshia:]
If I told you once, I told you twice,
You can see it in my eyes.
I'm all cried out,
With nothing to say.
You're everything I wanted to be.
If you could only see,
Your heart belongs to me.
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free,
Forever yours I'll be,
Baby won't you come and take this pain away.

Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you right?
But for them couple of seconds though,
When I couldn't get in touch with you.
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house

I got the 411 what's crackin what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess wat I'm tryin 2 say

But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere

All of this pain and glory

I came with 'share my world'
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldnt hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Of a real love

How we
Respect ourselves
And the men
Have no control
Of our self-esteem
And when
We see that
Then we can
Let go

[Chorus]

Now I made
Some mistakes
I lost some
Friends along
The way
But I don't
Carry it
'cause it
Made me
A better chick
Its my life
And I know
That there's
More for
Me to see
I may not be
What I'm
Suppose to
But I can
Tell you right now
I ain't what
I use to be

[Chorus]

Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by, and her belly gets big
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about to run away and never come back

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why

Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)

You only a customer
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls
You can taste it, my instict's basic
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es
All different colors of the spectrum
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em
Believe me I'm a connoisseur when I inspect 'em
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers
These young rookies, fail to understand
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's
You know what I do, drive your taste buds crazy

Every bite is more delicious

Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
Cause you're my favorite flavor
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon

My flavor's unreal
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through
Me too! Man you know how we do
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless

Is eat you up 'cause you look so good

(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)
All I wanna do
Is show you boy that I taste good too
(I know you taste good ma)
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)

We had it out
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine
Low calorie leave no cavities
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory

I'm searchin' for a real love

Oooh, when I met you I just knew 
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one

So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations 
Lead me to want some real love

I got to have a real love
Loves so true and oh baby
I thought your love was true
I thought you were the answer to

The questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe 
I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me twards
A love my heart can feel

Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime,
winter, spring, and fall

[Chorus: x2]

You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know

How it feels to have a real love 
'Cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

Didn't expect so much stress to develop between me and you
I knew that it wasn't easy but sometimes
When we fight it don't seems like God's design
But then I hear words you said
And I promised I would stand for you and be true through the bad and the good
And I know what it means to be committed
So here's a word for you but you just ain't with it

Trust me, them days is over
Can't understand how I
Let you sit on my shoulders

But I stayed and you played the right way in your place
And I prayed everytime you was away you'd see my face
But the me was you, and your
Pain was mine, and the
Same situation playing over in my mind
It seems

Ain't tryna hear you
Just tryna hear me
Don't wanna hear nothing, baby it's selfishly
I blaming you for the hurt in me, but it's not your fault that
I'm so incomplete

You see everytime I do it do it
I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's effecting how I'm breathing
Effecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon
Loving you deep in my heart
And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the seek
One thing I found, I had to take a look in mirror
See I can't leave you, until I learn to leave me

What was I thinking
That you could talk to me like that
You was holding me down, but I was holding me back
Looking inside myself, and has to see who I am, cause this is my trial, affecting my smile
I'm gotta walk (?), this is gonna be a while

And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here
Its makes me wanna, wooh

Let it go
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, going do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we
No time for moping around, are you kidding
And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
No stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my mind right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining
And I'm a still wear a smile if it raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad I got mine

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Aint worried about you and what you gonna do
I'm a lady so I must stay classy
Got to keep it hot, keep it together

(I walk around) Keep the mic on (acting strange, like a man in a daze)
I don't know what happened, son, I just lost my mind, son
It's like y'all, I wasn't strong, I couldn't hold it (people talking)
When I seen it, a nigga flesh on me, son, I can't really...
I couldn't hold it, g (I don't hear a word) I don't know, I'ma...
Nah, it went like this, nigga...

[Ghostface Killah]
It was him, the corner store, and a buttered roll
The shit dropped when I gave him two stomach holes
And one to the face, he fell sideways
I was up close, a part of his nose was stuck to my padres
Standing over him, shaking, kids screaming
He slapped my girl, that's the reason I was fiendin to lean him
Everything got, real slow, I ain't hear shit
My word, at least forty seconds, I seemed scared stiff
I pound him with the gun out, Big Den came, opened my hand
Removed the gun and the 6 speed, spun out
He floored it, past ninty on the B.Q.E.
I threw up all on his door, splashed his Gucci seats
I couldn't speak, I'm in a state of shock
About now they should be yellow taping the block and raid out my spots
Aiyo, I'm feeling a little bugged out, insane
I've lost my mind, people telling me ""Ghost, you acting mad strange""

[Chorus]
I walk around, acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
Although I don't hear a word they say

See what I'm saying?
I don't know, I just don't feel right, y'all, I don't know

Smoking mad cigarettes and shit
Nah, I don't wanna go in... I don't want the clank
I don't wanna go in the hospital, son
It's, yeah, don't... I just feel like I'm lost
In my own reality like, nah... know what I mean?
Even my face feel numb, son, I don't know...

Flashbacks of me blowing his brains out
All I remember, my shirt, I couldn't get them god damn stains out
Oxy Clean sweep 'round the chest area, right hand side
I'm plucking off little pieces of meat
And my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee
But I said ""No, I got these two snow bunnies in Venus Beach""
On the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, Denise from New York
'Round my man Killa way, where all the murders walk
Manhunt, police searchers, SWAT ran in my crib
Battering rams, early morning, you'll awaken my kids
Now my aunt gotta stay with whiz
She paranoid, having anxiety attacks cuz of these pigs
Plus my connect, they going crazy, they trying to slay me
I told 'em Friday I'd have they money, faggots trying to play me
I never eat up out a garbage can
I'd Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the father's plan

I ain't going nowhere, I ain't going nowhere, I'm aight
I'm aight, but I know one thing, if anybody touch me
I'm blowing they head smooth off, cops, connects, I don't give a fuck
Younahmean? They gon' feel a Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert
They gon' feel that bulldog, you know, I don't give a fuck
Don't put me in no mental clinics, ain't nothing...
Nahmean? If I make it out alive, , make it out alive, if not, fuck it!
I ain't, I ain't, yo... I can't take this shit no more, it's too hot
Nigga thinking I'm bugging out, I ain't bugging, I ain't bugging
Y'all niggaz'd bug out too if y'all had somebody flesh on you

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Let me talk to you, when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give ?
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

[Chorus]

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you

[Chorus]

I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of ? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

You're in my heart more than you may know

Make you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)

Brings you closer to your dreams

Can take away what your meant to be

That we done that's in the past
But fighting won't get us anyway

Every night there is one thing I do
I bow my head and I pray for you (pray for you)

Is for you to fall apart
The future will get clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

Your much more than a struggle that you go through
You're not defined by your pain, so let it go
You're not a victim, your more like a winner
And you're not in defeat, you're more like a queen

In each tear
There's a lesson,
Makes you wiser than before
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger than you know)
In each tear (in each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

In each tear (each tear)
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know
In each tear (make you so much broke)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

No no we can't be held out
No no oh no I I I can't be held out
You you you can't be held out
We we we can't be held out

Love
It makes you so much stronger (stronger)
It makes you so much wiser (wiser)
In each tear (in each tear)
And you so close to your dreams and
No mistake, no heartbreak can take away what you're meant to be",Each Tear,2009

If we ain't breaking them down
Then we letting them fly
Nah never I, always we
I came in the game dividing the pies by three
Then we got famish
So we set standards
Very similar to the ten crack commandments
Some couldn't take it
Others got lost and couldn't make it
He wanted to floss but couldn't fake it
The hood embraced it
The rest is basics
No need to rush be extra patient
The new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious
Same entourage no extra faces
Hands down the best no explanations
And to the top is the next destination
There ain't no time outs
Death is the only time we goin' sign out
So we goin' grind out

Top 5 dead or alive what they consider them
Soon as them things come in we get rid of em
Mo money mo problems gotta live with em
Only thing they care about is what you giving them
Not the energy that you wasted in the game
Or the tears that tripled down your face from the pain
The time the jaw cracked you wasted the cane
Had to do two shifts to make it the same
That all changed soon as you tasted the fame
And it was all worth it after you made you a name
Thanks to our heavily father
We fly on the jet now instead of the charter
Leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener
Do all of listening so we stay smarter
Everybody's a hero when they get scarred up
Its my ball check it up y'all better guard up

[Chorus]

When we step up out of our car the whole damn world is looking at us
Cause they knew us from before, now we ain't hurting no more
You can bring me the bill I will sign my name
Now we're flying private planes and such looking like a million bucks
You can't tell me nothing!

My eyes grows thin as I get older
Peace in pieces, bloody and bruised
I feel so helpless and confused

'Cause I hear

The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care

All you see is a felon
I know God can see what's right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case scenario is my birth place
I'm just trying to keep from falling victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson, convincing the adolescents there's a God up in heaven
Sending down blessings
And your future ain't brighter than your present, quit stressing

Are we living in a dream world? Are your eyes still green girl?

Mary J. Blige,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears, 
While we all sup sorrow with the poor, 
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears, 
Oh hard times come again no more. 

[Chorus] 
Tis the song, the sigh of the weary, 
Hard Times, hard times, come again no more 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door, 
Oh hard times come again no more. 

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay, 
There are frail forms fainting at the door, 
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say 
Oh hard times come again no more. 

[Chorus: x2] 

So many days you have lingered all around my cabin door, 
Oh hard times come again no more",Hard Times Come Again No More,2010

Pain, hurt, sadness and loneliness
Bought all that shit right up
Tossed away to the bottomless pit
Of the part of my mind that slips
The part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take that trip
Unless I'm sloppy drunk I pray for my mom,
I teach her the son that never gave a fuck about a scantron
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show the world some new colors and scene
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had tree smoked
Black and Mild, how dumb of me now,
I'm grape cigarello man
Any young black kid a guaranteed fan
On a downhill grind and I'm humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, am I my mom's calling,
Thank god she hit decline

Just like we should you know the saying,
Ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the gettin' while the gettin's good
Yeah demented, my brain was forced to transform wise up,
I'm checkin' the gate on humble tales
And minimum wage the girls tell it, Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt, he must be gay
Let's keep it chill, fuck being discrete
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat ya,
Cudders, HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow cause your money for blow
Don't take no shit you can blame my Ma I'm in the maze,
I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocket ship I be a blip in your radar bitch

So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high five sinners
All alone trying to hide from the shadows

They know where I be at, in my mind tryna get me

These worries are heavy,
They rest on my shoulders

Hate me now then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane,
It's a full time job to not lose my faith
Okay I've been here before,
Alone for the upteenth time or more
I'm tired of mu'fuckas sayin' that they worry about me
When in fact they probably never gave fuck about me

Mary J. Blige,"Loving you came easily
Yet it made me blind to all there was to see
Now my heart is filled with pain

You understand I never will
How did it come to be that you don't love me still?
Now it's getting to be plain

If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
I bet ya wouldn't go
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
You wouldn't walk out the door

Though some days the blues was our parade,
Still we marched through all the tears we made
Now I find that it wasn't no game of charades that you played

I did my best to bring you joy
How can you just leave me like a broken toy?
Where's the man that once was you?

If I could be within your mind
I would never think to treat you this unkind
The pain you caused will come to you",Betcha Wouldn't Hurt Me,2010
Mary J. Blige,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying the stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven,2010

So my baby ain't no way that I'ma let go

From the north to the south pole
On the east or the west coast
Every area code, all over the globe
Ain't no way on the planet you can go that I won't

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

'Cause I got days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
'Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8, 25/8

You ain't gotta worry about me, no
Ain't no question at my loyalty
You been there for me, even when nobody
Cared enough to check and see if I was breathing

See don't nobody really know me, (know me)
You and me, we got history
So I give you a part for loving me boy,
Put your hand in my hand I'll lead the way out

When things ain't going right
You know how to hold me tight
Can make a pain go away, oh

On the week day, on any day
On every day, I'm alive babe
I'ma love you, help me sing it out

Every day babe, every night babe

'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round

Another round (A round a round)

I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

Hair in a bun 'cause sometimes the hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet, look at you,
You a star, I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard in these sheets, I'm a God, Lord,
Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She post it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drink last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love

So she done came down
Double cup with ice, man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong, 'cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three for you and me

I won't be holding back

They fall victim to my system, guess I sure know how to pick 'em
And I'm always her regret, yeah, I'm always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever's coming next
It goes up and down, it's just up and down
She's crying now but she'll laugh again

But it's hard to hold a shadow

To intervene while I was begging God for
You to love me

But instead you pulled a pillow over your head

And you left me on my knees
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency
To intervene while I was begging God for
You to love me

You should've told me it was useless,
That I was praying empty prayers
But you hopped in your car, pulled out your keys
While you were leaving
I was begging God for you to love me

And I know that he had something better to do
Than to sit and listen to a broken-hearted fool
Could've been saving the world from a tragedy
But instead he was listening to me

I was asking, begging for a sign
To bring comfort to this lonely heart of mine
But apparently you're not what I need
I guess you walking out was him answering

Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I’m reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your best, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary

I wanna make you happy
But you just don’t see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I’m so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it’s yours
I can’t get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you’re pushing me away

I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside

Now I was hoping
We’d get through this together
You said you’d love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn’t it you who said
We’d be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it’s yours
I can’t get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can’t make you stay
I can’t make you stay
I can’t make you stay

I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
How I feel inside
How I feel inside
This is how I feel
This is how I feel

I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I’m to the point where I don’t know what I believe in

If you don’t want this, I don’t want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write, back
Tell me why it’s like that

So make up your mind, boy decide
We can’t go on like this, this ain’t right (it ain’t right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it’s time to go

Mary J. Blige,"One Night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends

Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

Y'all was like my brothers
I considered y'all as folks
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts
Talking about the life, trying to get it slinging dope
Niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first
And fuck all this money nigga, we was fam first
Looking at me balling, know that Instagram hurt
'Cause you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn Ghost
I would have rolled for you even in the same Hearst
Same cemetery, bury me in the same dirt
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work
""B.H we straight,"" that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow my nigga
I'm gone

Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I can't believe you (Not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do?
And when I came home I tried to feed you
And every song I was yellin free you (Free Dat Nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too
Now when I ride by I breeze through
I don't even stop, ain't a need to
And you the one that left nigga, I ain't leave you
Shit got realer, niggas got richer
I said the money train coming, niggas missed it
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister

Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

They want more than my mother
More than Omelly, and that nigga like my brother
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate em, I still love em
I might have said things, I never said fuck em
But I'm a live my life, get the money, ball hard
Still sending earned money for his calling cards
Rick ain't complaining, he got life behind bars
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all
'Cause none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet
None of y'all niggas send him pics yet
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rains, niggas get wet

Mary J. Blige,"We on?
Aight
One, two, three, go!

Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

I'm so high,, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth 
'Cause the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin' outlandish, I’m gonna show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
A record sold for me, it’s just mo for me
And you’re here for you too here, Kendrick, persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off, I ain’t takin' off these pistons
I’m takin' off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but four times two plus yours

I see myself performing at
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's, winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
'Cause my dream ain’t far away

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’m a take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down, in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I wrote 
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin' to you, I was walkin' it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello, we here

And I’m so happy I cry
'Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I could wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you know, that is the time for you to lift your bar
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

3:45 AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive, guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep makin' my millions
Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you love and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it's grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, as Einstein
It's all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all excited, you all repeat it
So call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I force you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me, Olu's son
Now he's Nas father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you

Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors your Josephine baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I've seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British knights, can rival your foamposites
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms

In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Did the words not come out right

Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here somehow
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Mary J. Blige,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power, to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires, will come to you

And if your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind, so kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue (like a bolt)
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Your dreams come true
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star,2013

Nodding my head just moving
My girlfriend dragged me to this place
Staring at the crowd like we do
I saw this guy through the people

But you came over to me
As sweet as can be
And grabbed my left hand
Started stepping
What else did I need to know
I said yes if you wanted to go
'Cause you are heaven
But you left me here

So I gotta see that boy again
'Cause I wanna feel that joy again
I remember leaning on his shoulder
Something and Cola
What he ordered
That’s why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again

Listen to me

My girlfriend says introduce her
But I ain’t gonna lie, I wanna lose her
You’re so nice you want to pay
Ooh you have a way with females
I didn’t get your number or email
What the hell was in my brain
'Cause I know that you believe
But I couldn’t let you see that I was stressing
I lost breath and
Then you grabbed your Mercedes keys
But you paused before you leave
And I just stood there
Like I didn’t have a care

So I gotta see that boy again

Something and Cola
What he ordered

That get away
Oh no, not the person you want
The person you want is losing
So you pray
But the circumstances, changes course
Which is entirely up to the boss
But remember
Just because it’s written don’t mean you can’t play
Your hand to change your fate

And where I'm going, boy, I don't really care
'Cause I've been there and I'll be there again
But tonight anywhere is better than here

The dawn is coming, I see the light
And if I start all over this time
This time I'll get it right

Don't ask me where I'm going
When you don't really care
'Cause anywhere
Is better than here

Mary Lambert,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw,
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like,
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3,500 hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins,
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it

I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

And I can't change

Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried

Mary Lambert,"Know girls who are trying to fit into the social norm
Like squeezing into last year's prom dress
I know girls who are low rise, mac eyeshadow, and binge drinking
I know girls that wonder if they're disaster and sexy enough to fit in
I know girls who are fleeing bombs from the mosques of their skin
Playing Russian roulette with death; it's never easy to accept
That our bodies are fallible and flawed
But when do we draw the line?
When the knife hits the skin?
Isn't it the same thing as purging
Because we're so obsessed with death
Some women just have more guts than others
The funny thing is women like us don't shoot
We swallow pills, still wanting to be beautiful at the morgue
Still proceeding to put on make-up
Still hoping that the mortician finds us fuckable and attractive
We might as well be buried with our shoes
And handbags and scarves, girls
We flirt with death every time we etch a new tally mark
Into our skin
I know how to split my wrists like a battlefield too
But the time has come for us to
Reclaim our bodies
Our bodies deserve more than to be war-torn and collateral
Offering this fuckdom as a pathetic means to say
""I only know how to exist when I'm wanted""
Girls like us are hardly ever wanted you know
We're used up and sad and drunk and
Perpetually waiting by the phone for someone to pick up
And tell us that we did good
You did good

So try this
Take your hands over your bumpy love body naked
And remember the first time you touched someone
With the sole purpose of learning all of them
Touched them because the light was pretty on them
And the dust in the sunlight danced the way your heart did
Touch yourself with a purpose
Your body is the most beautiful royal
Fathers and uncles are not claiming your knife anymore
Are not your razor, no
Put the sharpness back
Lay your hands flat and feel the surface of scarred skin
I once touched a tree with charred limbs
The stump was still breathing
But the tops were just ashy remains
I wonder what it's like to come back from that
Sometimes I feel a forest fire erupting from my wrists
And the smoke signals sent out are the most beautiful things
I've ever seen
Love your body the way your mother loved your baby feet
And brother, arm wrapping shoulders, and remember
This is important
You are worth more than who you fuck
You are worth more than a waistline
You are worth more than any naked body could proclaim
In the shadows, more than a man's whim
Or your father's mistake
You are no less valuable as a size 16, than a size 4
You are no less valuable as a 32a than a 36c
Your sexiness is defined by concentric circles within your wood

You are a goddamn tree stump with leaves sprouting out

How can I spell your name without the sound of
Autumn underneath my tongue
Without acknowledging the lovers who bent me in half
Bless them for bringing me to you
How can I say your name without
Also breathing the words, my God, I found you
How can I ever speak again with this mouth
When it has found where it belongs
When you touch me
I am a bed of calla lilies
I will make a house for you and fill it with evergreens
I will paint sunsets on every wall
So you can only see beautiful things
How can I say ""love"" without wanting to fold myself into you
Like a thousand paper cranes
Dear one
I was halved the moment I was born
The other piece of me is inside of your mouth
And I was found whole the moment you spoke",Dear One,2014
Mary Lambert,"Jessie is a friend,
Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed
It ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make 'er mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell 'er that I love 'er, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Oh where can I find a woman like that?

Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Sidewalks of people with who care to stare
My heart's too big for the city

I dream in color
But my life's in black and white
Will it ever get better

Nobody's monochromatic

Everybody's hurting
There's nothing more human than that
See the pieces of hearts missing
But watch how the light fills the cracks

Mary Lambert,"Living in the darkness
I wear it like a crown
Oh I've got tough skin
Ready for my bow
All I've got is two hands
I tied them in the middle
Ready for the red tape
To open up my ribcage

I offer souvenirs
A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here
Come in come in

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Want you to want me like I'm all you got
Mama see's seeing it but can't make me stop
Telling the truth it might mean you get broken
But letting it hurt that's my method of coping
Doubt in season like that smoke in my lungs
What they project on me what I've become
Down on my knees unsure what to say
No I never learned how to prey
Don't know, know who I been fooling
But you got me running in circles I'm ruined
Let you inside opened up all my wounds
Taking my ribcage and ripped it in two

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

Tie off all my tendons
Watch how they stretch
Oh I've got the muscle
But lord, I'm spent
Knocking down my sternum
Began at a young age
Too much space between
Open up my ribcage

I offer souvenirs
A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here
Come in come in

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space
The invitation's on the page
Open up my ribcage

There's impenetrable silence inside of my head
There's nothing I can buy when I'm practically dead
I get so tired of writing everything I should have said
That maybe this time I'll put my pen down and just tell you instead
You see I opened up my ribcage and violins flew out
The organs softly played through my violin mouth
I got lights hotter than love hidden beneath my tongue
Written on my skin
It tells me your the one

Everybody look around
Everybody look around
I don't know how to fill the space

What you got to moan about only what I've seen
Times are hard but I heard you say
Why you telling me
I've been seeing for myself
Down along the lea
Don't know how well off you are
Pills and money, safe and warm
Watching from your silver star
You don't know you're born
Harbored in your little cove
Loath to put to sea

Down along the lea

High hi the brain dead cry
What a loser what a state
Take a good look in her eyes
Pupils look like plates

And all attempts to fire it up again will fail

And play the waiting game

There's nothing I can do
So why do I keep holding on
I only wish I knew
I was born too weak and I feel like a fool

Before the night is out
Just a heap of ash
The wind is blown about

For him these feelings fade away
But for me they're still the same

And flickering its last
And through the dying light
We journey to the past

Cash in your ignorance learn about the truth
And it's no playground it's one big let down
It looks like a backstreet bargain baby

And on that high road you live in shadows
And the one that follows is your silent twin
And it's a sad reminder
That when you try to find her
She's back on the old main drag in trouble again

Ten hail Mary's and she's ready to score
Dealing with the damage of a grown up war
But turning tricks and tourniquets
Are nothing more than another wasted day

Cinderella's on the corner with her eyes in tears
Waiting for the moment when the magic appears
They expected her home for the past two years
I guess she lost her way

The tide is always turning
Deep inside your desire's burning
And you're dying just to get away

You thought you had it down
When you first came to this town
Now you're begging for a helping hand
And a brand new day
You're begging back all that Seven Sisters took away

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Mary Lou Williams,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man,2004

Mary Lou Williams & Her Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.","Stardust, Pt. 2",1996

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Mary Lou Williams Trio,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca

Aufwachen, Beastyboy und Mary sind da
Mach dich bereit mein Freund, jetzt wird rasiert“

Sperrt eure Lauscher auf

Good morning, ihr Missets, ihr Gagos
Macht eure Augen auf
Ihr wärt gern die Besten, aber aus der Traum
Mary Man steigt aus dem Rauch

(Good morning) 
Der Bi-Be-De-Ba-Be-Di-Beastboy
Erzählt euch Missets, was hier alles so schief läuft
Zu viele Larrys sind geblendet vom Licht
Und kämpfen für nichts, zu wenig Rapper rappen wie ich
Wie der Beastyboy mit dem Eye of the Tiger
Auf der Liste guter Rapper schneid' ich als Nummer eins ab (yeah)
Und weil leider kein Weiterer, der zurzeit grad 'nen Hype hat
Einen vergleichbaren Style hat, steht schon beim zweiten Platz keiner, he
Und keiner zaubert wie der motherfuckin' Murphy Man
Der Master of the Universe, ey, warte mal, das Studio burnt
Ist mir egal, was eure Crew so denkt
Ich baller' 'nen Part und ihr seid kahlrasierte Huensiens (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Und ihr wollt Texte mit Message
Dann gönnt euch Hydra 3D anstatt der CY-BEAST-Musik
Hier will ich nur Rapper ärgern oder mit Reimen jonglieren
Und mir mal kurz die Krone holen, weil sie sonst keiner verdient
Beastboy aka die Flowmachine, die nie stoppt
Aussagen wie, „ich bin der Beste“, sind bei mir Realtalk (Realtalk)
Damals hab ich bei meinen Lieblingsrappern mitgerappt
Und heut rapp' ich nur eignen Shit, weil niemand von den'n sicker flext
Ich komm' so lässig reingeswervt in das Game
Und ihr hofft, beim nächsten Patch werd' ich generft
Denn seit Beastboy wieder back ist, ist das Spiel nicht mehr gebalanct
Für mich ist das zu easy, ich brauch' wieder mal 'ne Challenge (yeah)
Ihr seid ja eigentlich ganz süß
Aber jeder, der nicht rappen kann, ist leider nicht mein Typ, mhm mhm (never)
Ihr wartet auf das, „no homo, bro“, doch ich sage, „no homophob“
Ihr Kakerlaken, ihr Bonobos
Ihr labert alle nur Kokolores (wooh!)
Ey, dass kein anderer Mensch so dope ist, steht seit Jahren schon in mei'm Horoskop
Ich fühle mich so wie Stroboskoplicht, weil es blitzt, wenn ich rappe
Mein Catchphrase ist, „ich bin der Beste“

It's a shame it rained today.""

Mary Martin,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1990
Mary Martin,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1990
Mary Martin,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1990

Where the little cherubs trot

Look at that knocked out moon
Been a-blowing his top in the blue

Never saw the likes of you

Mary Martin,"n olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set that's smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockefeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaus

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got

Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm

For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town

Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then

Love flew out again

You took my heart and threw my heart away

You gave me nights of cheer

So why can't we be lonely together?

With her sweetheart by her side, 
Through the windowpane, she looked at the rain, 
""We must stay home, Joe,"" she cried. 
""There's a picnic, too, at the old Point View, 
It's a shame it rained today."" 
Then the boy drew near, kissed away each tear, 
And she heard him softly say,
""Wait till the sun shines, Nellie, 
When the clouds go drifting by, 
We will be happy, Nellie, 
Don't you sigh. 

Down Lover's Lane we'll wander, 
Sweethearts you and I. 
Wait till the sun shines, Nellie, 
Bye and bye."" 

""How I long,"" she sighed, ""for a trolley ride 
Just to show my brand new gown.""

For the sun came shining down. 
And she looked so sweet on the big front seat

Mary Martin,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?",What is This Thing Called Love,2006
Mary Martin,"My day in the hills
Has come to an end, I know.
A star has come out
To tell me it's time to go.

But deep in the dark green shadows,
There are voices that urge me to stay.
So I pause and I wait and I listen,
For one more sound,
For one more lovely thing
That the hills might say!
The hills are alive
With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,
For a thousand years.
The hills fill my heart,
With the sound of music.

My heart wants to sing every song it hears.
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.
I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely.

I know I will hear
What I heard before.
My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more.",The Sound of Music [From The Sound of Music],2007

Mary Mary,"[Chorus:]
My heart has found a new beat
Ever since you came into my life
No I don't lose no sleep
'Cause I know He's walking by my side
And if you're looking for me
Safe in His arms is where you'll find me
'Cause I've gotta be
Gotta be happy, want to be happy

I was searching for a long time
For the right one to give my heart to
Then suddenly I looked to the sky
And I realized that it should be you
'Cause sometimes I stray away
And I make mistakes
But you still love me
So now and forever
Your arms is where I want to be

[Chorus:]

Tell me how would you describe happiness
Right now you're all good, later you're a mess
Maybe you should start making some changes
Ever consider reaching towards heaven
Your burden will get lighter and you'll have no desire
To turn away cause I can say
That His love won't ever change

[Chorus:]
Never ever had a treasure
Just to call my own
Until you came along
No matter what happens
You're mine forever
You've captured my soul
And I won't let go

Mary Mary,"There will be mountains
That I will have to climb
And there will be battles
That I will have to fight
But victory or defeat
It's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win
If I never try

I just can't give up now
I've come too far from where
I started from
Nobody told me
The road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far
To leave me

Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I want it to go
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say help me to be strong, oh

I just can't give up now
I've come too far from where
I started from
Nobody told me
The road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far
To leave me

Oh, I know You didn't bring me
Out here to leave me lonely, oh no
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that You are with me so I can't

I just can't give up now

Mary Mary,"It was once upon a time not long ago
Lived a little black boy in the middle of the ghetto
Pretty good kid but he always found trouble
Inner city life it ain't hard to find trouble
No income in the home you find struggle
2 years struggling it's no puzzle
He hit the block hard and found him a hustle
Burned the wrong bridge and now he needs muscle
He tried to let it go but the streets don't forgive
I guess they ain't heard of live and let live
But after going round and round he broke it down finally found out
That only god can save him now

I'm on my knees, down at the floor
You're the one I need oh lord
Save me now

Still I'm wondering
How in the world did I get here
And what am I doing
Took the ring and acted like I do
Without the ceremony
Now I got three little ones and I'm
Hurting and I'm lonely
Threw away my dreams when I left school
Now I'm 22 never should've choose him over you

Mary Mary,"He came to be, so meek and mild, a savior yet and humble child
A holy Lamb, precious lamb, they called him Lamb of God
It was the greatest demonstration of love that the world would ever know
God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son
And this son came as a lamb, he would become a conquering King
But he came as a Lamb, He would be king of kings
And Lord of Lords but he came as a Lamb, and he came for you
People came from miles around, all to worship and bow down
Oh the privilege, the privilege it was, they called him Lamb of God.
Sheppard's came seeking this lamb, and their lives will never be the same
The angelic host formed a choir, and sang from the heavenliest 
Wise men were wise enough to seek and bow down to this Lamb
He came to seek and to save the lost, he came because he loves you
It's great to know that God so loved the world
But more important to know, that God loves you
Now here it is, many years have passed
They say his time has come and passed
Oh but I'm so glad, that it remains
You're still the Lamb of God
John looked over the horizon and saw one walking as no man walked
And he said behold the, Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world
He's still saving, he's still redeeming, and he's still there for you today
Receive him, say yes to him, and he will change your life
Time can not change him and ages do not time him, he's still the Lamb of God

Still holy, still righteous, still the Lamb of God
Still savior, still redeemer, still the Lamb of God
Still alpha, still omega, still the Lamb of God 
Still lovely, still healing, still the Lamb of God
Still holy, still righteous, still the Lamb of God
Still savior, still redeemer, still the Lamb of God
Still saving, still loving, still the Lamb of God

Uh uh
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems
Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton
Stress beamin' down like the sun I felt rotten
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin'
I hear him knockin', sayin' that we got him
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya

They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin', uh, uh
Yeah, uh, check it out
There's a living power, make a man out a coward
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers

On the ground and that God wasn't willin'
It seemed like the only ones ballin' was the villains
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin' to our chillin'
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em
They sellin' venom and we buyin' it like denim
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin'
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up
Start switchin' your position, make your mind up
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up
Get your life lined up before time's up
Yo, yo, you know what?
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back
Uh, yeah, sing it out now

In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley
Never give up, press on through the storm
Weepin' man fall, for the night seem long
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'

I know it feels like your back's to the wall
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call
(Jesus!) Hangin' on a tight rope, fingers slippin' off
But you ain't by yourself dog, we all been lost
Stay on your course, carry your cross
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks
And I'm not finished, man listen
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter

Mary Mary,"""God made dirt and dirt don't hurt!""

Funny thing about a garden
Beauty lives within its gates
Bugs and thorns and weeds, they grow there
But they all help to create
Vivid color variations
Sweet aromas and sensations
Realize under it all, something not so beautiful
But we all

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) need a little dirt to grow.

Life at times can make you weak.
And I have cried myself to sleep
Cause reality makes you cry
But the truth will dry your eyes
Things they just can't stay the same
When you work hard and you pray
Yeah it may be kind of rough now
But the point I'm trying to make is that we

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) need a little dirt to grow.

Oh sometimes you may sing for yourself
You struggle hard just to prevail
its the lesson you need to learn
its the way you've got to earn
Champions never accept defeat
They fall and get back on their feet
Cause they know (they know)
Like I know (I know)
That if you want to grow we

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit

But I'm trying to do better and that's the thing that really hurts
All this sex and the drugs in my life mean nothing
When my Superfriend hugs me at night tears come rushing
There's no kryptonite, no dealing no lie that could be told
That can separate the power that you have over my soul
So stunting is a habit when I'm gripping this mic
Y'all thinking I'm a pimp but I'm trying to be like Christ
In real life yeah

[Chorus]

He heard me before I made a sound
Caught me before I hit the ground
He knows everything I need
Before I tell him anything
Loves me without requirements
Cant see Him but it's evident
He's something like the best of them
Said He's nothing like the rest of them

[Chorus]t

Can't nobody do me like my Superfriend
Can't nobody do me like my Superfriend (no) [Repeat: x2]",Superfriend,2008

And now today I can testify that I believe it
And on my way I realized He's the one who kept me

He has captured every tear assuring me He hears

Every prayer, waiting on the answer only to discover He is near
And He hears every prayer for He has done great things
And I believe He's a God that always answers prayer

I heard 'em say the prayers of the righteous availeth much
And now today I can testify that I believe it
Now on my way I wanna let you know that He will keep you

Every prayer, waiting on the answer only to discover He is near
And He hears every prayer for He has done great things
I believe He's a God that always answers prayer

Don't despise the tears you've cried
Or the prayers that you have prayed
Heaven heard your every word
And the answer, the answer's on the way

I heard 'em say there is an answer on the way
My God has done so many great things, great things
Hold on and you will see there is an answer on the way

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Mary O'Hara,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

When stars appear And shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all","I Surrender, Dear",1992
Mary Osborne,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1992
Mary Osborne,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Mary Osborne,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1992
Mary Osborne,"Heart and soul, I fell in love with you
Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul, I begged to be adored
Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing

But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, it's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul",Heart and Soul,2006
Mary Pearson,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?,2000
Mary Pearson,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2000
Mary Pearson,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Mary Pearson,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Mary Pearson,"Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Cause in my mind, you will stay here always

In my mind we can conquer the world

Mary Peyton Hodges,"It's still a mystery to me
That the hands of God could be so small
How tiny fingers reaching in the night
Were the very hands that measured the sky

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Heaven's love reaching down to save the world
Hallelujah, hallelujah, son of God, servant King
Here with us, You're here with us

It's still a mystery to me
How His infant eyes have seen the dawn of time
How His ears have heard an angel's symphony
But still Mary had to rock her Savior to sleep

How we need to hear from God

Hope that you don't mind our manger
How I wish we would have known
But long awaited Holy stranger
Make yourself at home
Please make yourself at home
Bring your peace into our violence
Bid our hungry souls be filled
World now breaking Heaven's silence
Welcome to our world
Welcome to our world

Tender brow prepared for thorn
Tiny heart whose blood will save us
Unto us is born

So wrap our injured flesh around You
Breathe our air and walk our sod
Rob our sin and make us holy

Perfect Son of God
