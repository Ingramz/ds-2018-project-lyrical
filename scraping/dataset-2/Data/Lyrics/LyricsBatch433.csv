Jessi Colter,"I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky",Will the Circle Be Unbroken,2016
Jessi Colter,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Jessi Dixon,"Je t'aime
Te amo
Aishiteru
Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, fluently spoken here
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Jessica,"Con unas ansias locas quiero verte hoy
Espero ese momento en que escuche tu voz
Y cuando al fin estemos juntos los dos
Qué importa qué dirán tu padre y tu mamá
Aquí sólo importa nuestro amor, te quiero

Amor prohibido murmuran por las calles
Porque somos de distintas sociedades
Amor prohibido nos dice todo el mundo
El dinero no importa en ti y en mí, ni en el corazón
Oh, oh baby

Aunque soy pobre todo esto que te doy
Vale más que el dinero porque sí es amor
Y cuando al fin estemos juntos, los dos
Qué importa qué dirán, también la sociedad
Aquí sólo importa nuestro amor, te quiero

Jessica,"Where in the world did you come from?
Seems like I looked up and there you were
Didn't think about it then, but when I look back I believe now
That miracles do occur

'Cause I can reach up and touch any star in the sky
Put my arms 'round the moon if I try
Never thought I could feel so much love in my life
No, I never thought I'd know how but I do now

Is this a dream or are you real
I'm trying hard not to lose my cool
When you're kissing me I just get so lost in the moment
I hope I'm not acting like some kind of fool

'Cause I can reach up and touch any star in the sky
Put my arms 'round the moon if I try
Never thought I could feel so much love in my life
No, I never thought I'd know how, but I do now

Never had no one to miss me
Never had no one who kissed me like you
Never had no one who loved me like you

I can reach up and touch any star in the sky
Put my arms 'round the moon if I try
Never thought I could feel so much love in my life
No, I never thought I'd know how

'Cause I can reach up and touch any star in the sky
Put my arms 'round the moon if I try
Never thought I could feel so much love in my life

And I see now from where we are

I don't want you to cry
Don't wanna s-say good-bye
But I know that we falling apart
I don't need your lies
And if you symphathize
Tell me how will I know who you are

It's to late now
That we've gone this far
To see what's here within
Though we said that we never part
Maybe I've been trying to hard
Do you believe in love
I don't know why
But I still can't see who you are

I don't want you to cry

Tell me how will I know who you are

So I think we should let it go now
And maybe we'll findl love again

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

And what could be worse than never saying it at all 
Is never knowing the feeling, never feeling the fall 

What's it gonna take to get us both there 
Can't you see what I'm suggesting, it's a double dare

You start if you have the nerve 
I'll trust my heart, but you go first

Hey baby, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying, we're flying above it all
Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've got such amazing grace
I've never felt this way
Oh, show me heaven, cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

Here I go, I'm shaking just like the breeze
Hey baby, I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying, I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
I've shivers down my spine
And it feels divine
Oh, show me heaven, cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

Do you know what it's like to dream a dream

I felt you move closer

""What are you doing?""
I thought not listening to you
You see I'm taking a chance
I'm thinking about flying over the blue

And it's crazy to be this out of practice
And have it all come so naturally
Don't you love knocking logic right off its axis
And watch it float far out to sea

Jéssica Cristina,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away

Jessica Edwards,"My baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd
Cause people like to talk, Lord, how they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be leaving with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My, behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile
She's never too far away or too tired to say ""I want you""

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

I won't give up 'cause He holds me in His arms

Jessica Jacobs,"Where have all my friends gone? 
They've all disappeared.
Turned around maybe one day, you're all that was there.
Stood by on believing, stood by on my own.
Always thought I was someone, turned out I was wrong. 
And you brought me through and you made me feel so blue, 
Why don't you stay behind?
So blue. Why don't you stop, and look at what's going down.

If I had an old woman she'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone who won't sing with you.
Give all of my mercy, give all of my heart.
Never thought that I'd miss you, that I'd miss you so much.
And you brought me through and you made me feel so blue.
Why don't you stay behind?
So blue. 
Why don't you stop and look at what's going down.

All my life (staying while) I'm waiting for (staying while) 
Someone I could (waiting around) show the door
(now that I'm blue) but nothing seems to change (that I'm blue from now on)
You come back that month so blue.
Why don't you stay behind? 
So blue.  
Why don't you, why don't you stay behind?
So blue. 
Why don't you, why don't you stay behind?
So blue 
Why don't you stop and look at what's down",Blue,2003
Jessica Jacobs,"No fun in hanging around here all day
Seems like I'm pissing all over my leg
Walking the plank
Watching the sharks as they swim waiting for dinner
Your gravity's defeating me, sadness and beauty are one in the same
Now I'm drawing a line in the sand, over and over
Don't you feel the same way
I need to reciprocate
All those things that I have learned, have learned
Storms in my head, they are brewing today
Too much resistance will soon break the gauge

Sucked into space, notice the lack of O2
Something's not right here
Your gravity's defeating me, sadness and beauty are one in the same
Now I'm chasing salvation again over and over
Don't you feel the same way
I need to reciprocate
All those things that I have learned, have learned
Don't you feel the same way
I need to regurgitate
All these things that I have learned, have learned",Gravity,2003

To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you

But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And how I used to club hop on weekends

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

Race home, open the door, run upstairs,
Throw my bag on the floor, log on, two seconds later,
I get a message from you saying 'hey baby'

Been going crazy thinking bout you all day,
So much to tell you, boy I feel the same way,
Can't wait to see you, just you
And I cause every night I've been thinking what it would be like.

I get a rush,
More than a crush,
Almost love,
Makes me feel high,

Said nothing at all,

Said it good to finally hear your voice,
Started talking, kinda random,
Said you were a shy boy, for such a fly boy,
You said it's you that makes me feel that way,
I'm like sometimes even I don't know what to say

I get a rush, more than a crush, almost love,
Makes me feel high,
Every time I think about us.

I should just tell you how I'm feeling yeah

Jessica Johnson,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

And life was nothing but an awful song

I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

Looks, three.
And I' still on unemployment,
Dancing for my own enjoyment.
That ain't it, kid. 
That ain't it, kid.

""Dance, ten
Looks, three,""
I like to die!
Left the theater and 
Called the doctor for
My appointment to buy

Tits and ass.
Bought myself a fancy pair.
Tightened up the derriere.
Did the nose with it.
All that goes with it.

Tits and ass!
Had the bingo-bongos done.
Suddenly I'm getting nash'nal tours!
Tits and ass won't get you jobs
Unless they're yours.

Didn't cost a fortune neither.
Didn't hurt my sex life either.

Flat and sassy,
I would get the strays and losers.
Beggars really can't be choosers.
That ain't it, kid. 
That ain't it, kid.

Fised the chassis.
""How do you do!""
Life turned into and 
Endless medley of
""Gee it had to be you!""
Why?

Tits and ass!
Where the cupboard once was bare
Now you knock and someone's there.
You have got 'em, hey.
Top to bottom, hey.

It's a gas!
Just a dash of silicone.
Shake your new maracas and you fine!
Tits and ass can change your life.
They sure changed mine.

Have it all done.
Honey, take my word.
Grab a cab, c'mon.
See the wizard on
Park and Seventy-Third
For

Tits and ass.
Orchestra or balcony.
What they want is whatcha see.
Keep the best of you.
Do the rest of you.

Pits or class.

I'm just savouring familiar sights
We share some history, this town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of him
Time to book a room to stay tonight

Number one is to find some friends to say, you're doing well
After all this time, you boys look just the same
Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels
Settle in to play ""Do you remember so and so?""
Number three is never say his name

And, oh, the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that he won't be around

Oh, who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway
You know it takes more than just a memory to make me cry
And I'm happy just to sit here, round a table with old friends
See which one of us can tell the biggest lies

And there's a girl, she's falling in love near where the pianola stands
With a young local factory out-of-worker, just holding hands
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay

Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the field
In our day

Oh, the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that he won't be around",Flame Trees,2016
Jessica Mauboy,"Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

Make-believing, we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside, I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

Next to your heartbeat where I should be

Inside these pages you just hold me

With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

There is a season (turn, turn, turn)
And a time for every purpose, under heaven

A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing

To everything (turn, turn, turn)
There is a season (turn, turn, turn)
And a time for every purpose, under heaven

A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late",Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season),2003

Jessica Robinson,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

All I ever need, is you to take this crown,
Just lay me down,
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love,
Between you and I (just you and I, just you and i)
Baby, just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
Oh ya know that drives me crazy

Violets are blue,
'n' every color, brings remnants of you,
Reach up and touch what you can feel,
Captivated, so surreal,
Drowning inside,
Of your soul that runs so deep,
As I'm lying here beside you, infatuated, I'm so weak

Say that you'll understand
That tonight, is a night, to love again,
Sweet memories,
Of kisses we've blown in the wind,
And I'll cherish this quiet time we spend alone

Sweet silver bells
All seem to say,
""Throw cares away.""
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air

Oh how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale,
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

On, on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home

Jessica Vigneault,"Entre musique et poésie
Entre prescience et nostalgie
Entre espoir et mélancolie
Entre la corde et l’arcanson
Entre le cri et la parole
Entre le ruisseau et l’école
Est née un jour la sage-folle
Qu’on appelle encor la chanson
Est-ce un cri de joie ou de guerre
Est-ce un enfant ou bien sa mère
Est-ce l’amour qui sur la terre
Inventa le premier refrain?
Comptine, berceuse ou romance
Chaque siècle s’y recommence
La chanson c’est la voix immense
Qui parle au nom du coeur humain
Avec trois mots d’amour en tête
Voyez la moindre chansonnette
Qui fait le tour de la planète
Revient et dit: c’est votre tour
À la complainte, à la rengaine
Qui se sont donné tant de peine
Pour entrer dans la grande chaîne
Puis en sortir le même jour
Avec trois accords de guitare
Deux amants qu’un destin sépare
Une nuit de lune, une gare
La chanson vous fait un roman
Et vous fait vivre ses alarmes
Et vous met dans les mains des armes
Et vous emplit les yeux de larmes
Et le coeur de grand sentiment
Elle a sauvé plus d’un navire
Elle a renversé des empires
Elle a su pourfendre ou séduire
Les plus faibles et les plus forts
Sa noblesse va sans les lettres
Elle n’a pas trouvé son maître
Elle a nommé, montré les traîtres
Cela pourra servir encor
C’est la fille aînée du langage
Qui part avec pour tout bagage
Ses mots qui font dans les cordages
Do, ré, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do
Quand on la voit flotter au faîte
Des mâts, des bras et des poètes
C’est que la lumière s’est faite
C’est qu’elle a le vent dans le dos
Et qu’on peut commencer la fête",Entre Musique et Poésie,2010

Who knows where I'll land,
Before I go far away
Could you hold me close
And maybe then I'll stay, oh

In ways they come and go
And I shut down because it's easier that way,

No warmth and never good light, instead,
The dreary hour's always upon me
Freezing up my home
Towering above me like a god-less sky

I can't go on like this
Not a day more,
Pouring all I have come to know
Into open hands that are still somehow closed,
I can't go on like this
Not a day more

This is a shape of love
Jagged in a way its love,
The one that cuts, you're leaving room
For me to still go out and find some
Take control and leave behind a part of me that's still attached to you

[Chorus]

I know,
You are not enough
I know
You are not enough
You put me in the state of mind of someone else
Who I've looked at through their broken eyes,
Begging
Does everybody know?
Does everybody know
This face?

Moving quickly trying to catch whats mine, 
Whats destined, come inside the dreamer
I'll be rushing, making a lot of noise.

Take my jacket, all my belongings
I don't need them they do me no good
They weigh me down
This living is so heavy
And I need space to get on a higher plane

See how I run, you see how I'm running now

Don't start thinking that's how you'll lose it
You step left, right you can't get confused
I'll take my chances under the pressure
A risk ain't nothing, there's nothing I can lose

I'm not standing still on this mountain
I'm chasing down whats been haunting me
I'm staring up and into the great heights
I won't look down
Its not where I want to be

Eyes in which I dream

Beautiful, drawer that I can hang on to

He wouldn't preach 
Unless he found something he believed would last 
That he believed could the hands of time

Out diggin' deep
A gentleman, He'd bring me peace

Passing everything I could have done, could have held in and embraced, 
I am open these days

And who but the sun knows if I'll rise,
It's taking me a long time to make this compromise,
You know what I wanted and I'm wanting it still

Let them watch while I cry and remember where I came from,
It's like kissing in the dark,
Looking for the lips that can make a kind mark

It's so easy to forget and fall back in
So I start listening to something that was said
In a world that's deafening above everything

I hear Your voice
Coming through the static
It's so automatically loud and clear
It's You and things that used to matter
Suddenly just scatter when You break through
The noise

Through the noise everything disappears
But Your voice

",The Noise,2006
Jessie Daniels,"I'm staring in the mirror
Looking back at me
Somehow You've replaced yourself
And don't like what You see

You've been asleep for far too long
To what other people think
So You bend and You break
And You lose along the way

What once was beautiful
I want to

Stand out
I wanna stand tall, I wanna be myself
Even it means, I won't fit in at all
I wanna be real, I wanna be me
'Cause everything I am is who I'm meant to be
I was meant to be free

Why are we so quick to hide originality?
We try and try to fit inside a false reality
We're all the same when it comes to putting on the face
And it's such a shame, oh it's such a waste

'Cause what makes us beautiful
Is what make us

Stand out
I wanna stand tall, I wanna be myself
Even if it means, I won't fit in at all
I wanna be real, I wanna be me
'Cause everything I am is who I'm meant to be
I was meant to be free

We are, we are beautiful
We are, we are beautiful
We are, we are beautiful
We are, we are beautiful

What makes us beautiful
Is what makes us

Stand out
I wanna stand tall, I wanna be myself
Even if it means, I won't fit in at all
I wanna be real, I wanna be me
'Cause everything I am is who I'm meant to be
I was meant to be free

We are, we are beautiful
We are, we are beautiful
We are, we are beautiful
We are, we are beautiful

We are

I taste just like candy..
.. so dance with me

Yo, now let me paint y'all a picture
Fox pimp hard, just quiet like a whisper - don't get it mixed up
Bad little sista; not bad meaning bad but
bad meaning good - DAM I'm so hood
You should see me in them jeans
It's hard to describe and
Being cocky is just a part of the vibe
I might stop and holla and pop my collar
Maybe a little conceited but that's always needed
Love attention when I'm passin by
See I show a little cleavage then I catch his eye
Just the thought of him eatin, I was outside soakin
Duke standin loc'in, mouth wide open
I walked over, lickin my lips
And adjustin my {tits} and switchin my hips
{Shit} he threw his hand on my waist
Looked in my face and said he wanna know how I taste

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

Now just imagine me nude, stretched out
I'll be all over the news if this gets out
So HOT that the press might ban me
Now how bad you wanna know if I'm sweeter then candy?
What would you risk? Would you put up the car?
Taste my na na in the rain on the hood of your car
Or the back of the plane, {nipples} all out
Bent over the sink with my panties in your mouth
When my dark skin complexion steps in
Won't take no questions to get him and the
thought of Fox give him an erection
to get real stiff at the sight of my {tits}
Now we can role play, you be the pilot
I'll be the stewardess boy I ain't knew to this
When I lay on my stomach and throw my legs back
Y'all probably won't know how to act

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

I'm real sweet like a candy corn
I'm in your thoughts late night when your boys are gone
Picture me, t-shirt, no panties on
Or maybe topless, homie I'm priceless bwoy
The kind of girl that love to talk {shit}
'Specially when I'm on top - the whole show stop
Even though I'm sweet, ain't nuttin sweet
Let me know when you're ready to eat

Oh I know that we can change some of the things that are beyond our control
And the vision of us may be blurry
But use your heart to see
Just follow the beat, the rhythm will lead you right back to me

Sometimes it's a game of give and take
It's easy to break
But hold on and wait
Have a little faith

I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love

The battle of us could be simple
Escape without being hurt
'Cause love is our shield, keeps us concealed
From what could get even worse

So baby let me be the soldier
Don't be overtaken by pride
Just close your eyes, take my hand
I promise to keep us alive

In love and war
Knock me down
And I'll get back up wanting more
Through the fire and rain
It makes me numb from the pain
That's the price, that's the price, I'll pay

When I was building a home,
You made a bed of your own,
Or perfectly the life of three
But now your cover is blown,
You get to be on your own,
And find another stupid girl like me
(Stupid girl like me, stupid girl like me)

So go out and party, cuz I’m just getting started
And I’m dancing to a brand new beat
It gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
Gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat

So go out and party, like you’re not broken-hearted
Cuz you’re now one just mistake on my beat
It gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
Gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat

I wanna know, was I the one
Or just the chick on the side?
I gave it all, put down my walls
You dare say I didn’t try
But you won’t stop, stop telling me what what you think I want to know
I’m ejecting the sign of you deleting the thought of you
Record this and watch me go

When I was building a home,
You made a bed of your own,

To get the people going dumb and insane
Hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mud and the rain
Women on shoulders, tops off, shouting my name
I'm all in their brain, why would I complain?

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it’s been said many times, many ways
""Merry Christmas to you""

Will you still love me tomorrow

But will my heart be broken

Jessie Mueller,"It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and it's patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect but she tries
She is good but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person
And makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless just enough
Who'll get hurt 
But who learns how to toughen up when she's bruised
And gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck and be scared
Of the life that's inside her
Getting stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone but it used to be mine

Used to be mine
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine",She Used to Be Mine,2016

With 50 in my Pocket
The Covers at home

I said I would
Take a chance
Hope I could win

A little Drink
Pulling them Slots
Made me think

I played the Nickel
Played the Quarter
Played the Dollar

I'll make em feel it playa
What chu hatas tryna do 
Rome already did it playa

My wheels spin like a Farris wheel
Since my days of youth 
I was bumpin dolla bills
You niggas kno it's real

And imam tight and still
Only I was 8 when I signed why 1st deal
It's in my genetics to neva be a jealous man
'Cause a jealous man is part feminine 

I'm half amazing my homeys blazin
And dey don't hit the club till they look Asian
See you could blind fold em wit a shoe string
Niggas tryna study how I try ta do thangs

Wit cha blue wings like the water in grill Jamaica
And we far from fakas see cake like bakas
Hatas cannot break us 
Ralph can't forsake us
'Cause we built the legacy like the LA Lakers

No one ever taught you how to stand by

And more times this love is just uphill

You never stop running
You don't even bother tryna keep your smile
Let me take you back, boy let me try
We might be alright
Perfect ain't coming but we'll be alright

Don't let goodbyes come too easy
Love me, just let me know that you need me
Love me, I'll teach you how to love me, love me

Even though you had me crying every night
I see you're trying
I'm grateful 'cause I see you're trying

I know I know I know I know why I shouldn't stay
But I'm stuck tryna save you from you
And you should know that I'm at your mercy

Fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot

You and me, we need to make it, so it's just us two

Could it be a secret to keep?

Never be a friend of mine, never see my better side
Maybe you'd be terrified
Of all the secrets you were wishing you won't ever find
Is deep inside me
And I don't wanna hide me

'Cause I know about my love
Because I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love

Pick it fast like a flight far away from here (Fly away)
Although I know I feel at home whenever you are near
Live my life you better cold cut to this (Just don't cut it, want you near)
I wish you'd just hold me open just to see your vision clear (I'm always near)

Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone?
Do you need someone? Is it too late to talk?
Did I wait too long?
Thousand words
Don't change a thing
Is it only three?
Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it

How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved
(To love and to be loved)

I'm losin' a thing
I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
'Cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartache
Whatever you wish for you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're feeling small
Alone in the night you whisper

Thinking no one can hear you at all
You wake with the morning sunlight
To find fortune that is smiling on you

Don't let your heart be filled with sorrow
For all you know tomorrow

Jessie Ware,"One, two, three

Sat inside a railway station
Drinking a cup of coffee on my own
Listening to the strangest conversation
About children and holidays in Rome

Last night I sat inside a bar room
And I was thinking 'bout my childhood home
I think I need to talk to mama
'Cause I'm about to have a child all of my own

And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
I hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me

I've been thinking about my husband
From seventeen, the only love I've known
And I could place no one above him
So beautiful and so naive alone

I've not even called my family
About the life that's 'bout to find me home
For many years, the lights would blind me
But now I find the only one that leads me home

And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
Hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me

And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
Hope she knows that I found a man far from my father

'Cause tonight we'll have no need to dream

I'll make you see in a new light

That we could lock into the same melody

Jessop Maticeuski Shumack,"

I want you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!

Jessy,"I've been caged by you for such a long long time
You had your own particular way to fill my mind
With low esteem, regarding myself
So I kept me hidden within my shell
And it took so long for me to see
How demolishing you were to me

[Chorus]
Look at me now I'm stronger than before
'Cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
And I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men

I've been blind and foolish but I was just a girl
You seduced me with your lies and promissed me the world
Now I've had it with you and your twisted games
And no longer will you make me feel so ashamed
I have found the power to open the cage
I left you behind me I turned the page

Oh he still can roll your heavy stones away

Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

I’ve had questions for tomorrow,
there’s been times I didn’t know right from wrong.
But in every situation,
God gave me blessed consolation,
that my trials come to only make me strong.

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to trust in Jesus,
I’ve learned to trust in God.

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to depend upon His Word.

I’ve been to lots of places,
I’ve seen a lot of faces,
there’s been times I felt so all alone.
But in my lonely hours,
yes, those precious lonely hours,
Jesus lets me know that I was His own

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to trust in Jesus,
I’ve learned to trust in God.

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to depend upon His Word.

I thank God for the mountains,
and I thank Him for the valleys,
I thank Him for the storms He brought me through.
For if I’d never had a problem,
I wouldn’t know God could solve them,
I’d never know what faith in God could do.",Through It All,2004

Why we pull away from each other so easily
Even though we're all walking the same road
Yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves

But I, I don't care what label you may wear
If you believe in Jesus you belong with me
The bond we share is all I care to see
And we can change this world forever
If you will join with me, join and sing

Oh you're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

The day will come when we will be as one
And with a mighty voice together
We will proclaim that Jesus, Jesus is King
And it will echo through the earth
It will shake the nations and the world will see, see that

You're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

To take a stand, to make a vow
I won't let go, you're not alone
Now and forever we'll sing together

So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us

Snow was fallin', drifts were high
And I was weary from my driving
And I stopped to rest for awhile

I sat down at a truck stop
I was thinking about my past
I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

I don't fall too easily

Tell me why you're so downcast

But I pray it's gone at last

When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared

Jessy Dixon Singers,"I am just a poor boy, 
Though my story's seldom told, 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, 
Such are promises 
All lies and jest 
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest. 
 
When I left my home 
And my family, 
I was no more than a boy 
in the company of strangers 
in the quiet of a railway station, 
Running scared. 
Laying low, 
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
Where the ragged people go, 
Looking for the places 
Only they would know. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Asking only workman's wages 
I come looking for a job, 
But I get no offers. 
Just a come-on from the whores 
On Seventh Avenue 
I do declare, 
There were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
And wishing I was gone, 
Going home 
Where the New York City winters 
Aren't bleeding me, 
Leading me, 
Going home. 
 
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
And a fighter by his trade 
And he carries the remainders 
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
And cut him till he cried out 
In his anger and his shame, 
""I am leaving, I am leaving"" 
But the fighter still remains

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

Jessye Norman,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.","Speak Low, song for voice & piano (from ""One Touch of Venus"")",1992
Jessye Norman,"There's not a morning I begin
Without a thousand questions
Running through my mind
That I don't try to find the reason
And the logic in the world
That God design
The reason why, a bird was given wings
If not to fly, and praise the sky
With every song it sings
What's right or wrong
Where I belong
Within the scheme of things

And why have eyes that see
And arms that reach
Unless you're meant to know there's
Something more
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for
Why have the wings unless you're meant to fly
And tell me please why have a mind
If not to question why

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare to have the chance to
Pick the fruit of every tree
Or have my share of every sweet imagined possibility
Just tell me where, where is it written, tell me where

If I were only meant to tend the nest
Then why does my imagination sail
Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare to see the meanings
In the mornings that I see
Or have my share of every sweet imagined possibility
Just tell me where, where is it written, tell me where
Or if it's written anywhere

Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

Jessye Norman,"If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I'll wait for you
'Til you're here beside me, 'til I'm touching you
'Til I hear you sigh I'll wait for you

Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Everyday just remember, how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forever more I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
Time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my arms

The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen
