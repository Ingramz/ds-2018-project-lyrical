Getto,"Cuando cojas este mensaje llámame
Que voy en camino pal estudio
Estoy bien encojoná

To esta gente que dijo
Que iba estar en el disco
A la hora e la verdad echaron pa atrás
Me dejaron bien pegá

Ellos están equivocau
Se le olvida que yo no tengo
Que cojer pon con nadie
Yo soy la caballota

why lo mio yo lo e sudau sola
Pero, no te preocupes pay
En este disco están, los que son
Los que no, no hacen falta

Bueno , llámame pa tras
Que clase e jodedores
Que me mamen el bicho papi
Tu vas a morir bienvenidos sean todos

A la calle al lodo a pelarse los codos
A fajarse como un campeón por un cinturón
Que pajó cabrón, que pajó cabrón

Aqui se bate el cobre why
Que viva el pobre, why que me odie quien mi odie
Por eso ahora con estas letras
Mi corazón se acelera me llaman la perra

Yo soy la perra en persona
Why los que campean en mi zona
Reacciona, o kieren que abra la boca
Yo con na jodo, mis palabras son de plomo
Why yo los desplomo, why los descojono

Soy la compañía de un gangster
Que me tiene un cariño aparte
Yo soy su arte, su mano e suerte
Vengo adinerada, acompañada de una escolta
Mis socio de cariño me llama su corta

Como Dios nos guarda de los enemigos
Llevamos tanto tiempo de estar unidos
El es un cocorote, que exige su respeto
Yo hago mi trabajo por que soy de hierro

Que te acompañe Dios
Que te acompañe Dios
Que te acompañe la suerte
Que te acompañe la suerte

Yo tengo boca de plomo, ""Pla""
Why te provoco la muerte, ""Comon""
Yo tengo boca de plomo, ""Pla""
Why te provoco la muerte, ""Comon""

Pues como la calle esta mala
Why nadie es a prueba e bala
Ando con un corta
Un peine e treinta apuntando a tu cara

De ti depende si el gastam dispara
Nadie me para
Me cuido mas de ti que de la jara, pana
No sacas na con tirar la mala
Porque a la mala
Obligas a mi glog a disparar balas

Al escenario de la calle
Yo hago mi entrada
Soltando un poco e plomo
Metiendoles con ganas

No experimentes, sentir que te metan caliente
No experimentes, sentir la furia de mi gente
Gastam no miente, muchos me tiran, se arrepienten
Tonto pendiente tu vas a morir

No se equivoquen, por que soy del sur
Si los gatos mios, te dan con rifles why aks full
Les da lo mismo, darte un baúl
""Who the fuck is you?""
Yo soy el Gastam del area sur

Tu vas a morir me voy a toas
Why escupo plomo le meto a cualkiera
Yo no perdono, yo, estoy valorado
Entre los mas caros why si disparo de claro
Tu vas a morir

Si un enemigo nunca perdona
Metele primero why dile
Tu vas a morir, si se han metio
Con el corillo que esta encendío
Que lío tu vas a morir

Getto why gastam con la perra
Si se equivocan guerra, why te digo
Tu vas a morir, estate kieto mijo
Tu sabes que con nosotros tu vas a morir

Que te acompañe Dios
Que te acompañe Dios
Que te acompañe la suerte
Que te acompañe la suerte

Yo tengo boca de plomo, ""Pla""
Why te provoco la muerte
Yo tengo boca de plomo, ""Pla""
Why te provoco la muerte

""Dale,do this, Ivy, dale, woo
Vamo allá mami, la perra
Getto why gastam, tu vas a morir

Hello Ivy, te habla Budah

Getto & Gastam,"Un 5 de Julio del año 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
Algún día seré rico o moriré tratando

Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

Wild Bandana, sto 

Sto crescendo male oppure forse no
Io capisco male oppure siete voi
Mi stupisco sempre per tutto quanto
Mi incupisco sempre perchè già lo so
Se mi metto a scrivere son già le sei
Spengo la candela, spengo quell’incenso
Spengo la mia testa e tutto ciò che ha dentro
Svengo nel letto e compenso
Svengo nel letto e contemplo
Sì, come se fosse un decesso
Siamo delle pile, delle pile vuote
Venti pile vuote le riverso sopra il blocco note
Fiume in piena, catene di edera sopra la schiena
Sì le mie radici me le tengo appresso
Sono morto così tante volte
Tanto da scordarmi di chi fossi
Devo ritrovar me stesso
Tu c’hai le botte sul telefono
No, mica come me che c’ho le bozze sul telefono (seh)
Tu c’hai le cozze, ma in testa

Non sai cosa cerchino da te ma
Non ti importa più di tanto in fondo

Faccio ‘sti soldi e vado via per un po’
Che Milano cuoce come carta da forno
Tu avevi un cazzo di sogno
Ma per riuscirci hai preso un cazzo di troppo
Ciò che ho visto resta qui con i miei
Tu fai il pitbull su Facebook, qua sul tempo fai schifo
Non mi conosci sono peggio dal vivo
Stai confondendomi per questo sto qui poi
Ciò che ho in tasca me lo spendo e spesso male
È impressionante fuori 
Non c’è un cane però resto uguale con i cazzi miei
Che provo a farci pace
Ora casa dista qualche K ma
Mandarci te resta una passeggiata sai

Non si muove da Milano dal 2004

Porsche Panamera
La vera natura di un uomo
È riempire di soldi ste borse
Ho anelli e collane
Pago l’affitto per me e per mia madre
Non li sento i commenti di questi, li lascio parlare
Li lascio affogare mentre prendo il volo
E divento un puntino lontano nel cielo che stanno a guardare
Nei messaggi privati lei mi chiama “Papi”
Mentre il mondo odia qua fanno la ola per questi scappati
Chi ha i denti non ha il pane
Io ho i denti coi carati
Dieci chili di stile che stanno copiando oramai tutti quanti
Senza risultati

Ghali,"Il momento giusto è ora
Ho un solo obiettivo, e una vita sola
Non mi son mai pentito (mai), ma di una cosa sola, la scuola
Chiudo il negozio, scrivo ""torno tra mezz'ora""
Ho perso troppo tempo dietro a scemenze altrui
Messo troppo in disparte negli angoli più bui
Ora il rap è più forte di me
Ho una carriera in cui rappo come vuole lui
Crisi, di adolescenza
Crisi, di astinenza
Dio riempimi di benza, mamma dammi la tua pazienza
E io lo so dai, so che anche tu sai, che i consigli che dai alla fine non li segui mai
E senza lei e senza sigarette sto nei guai
Mentre cammino, mi giro, so che tu non tornerai

Demoni sorgevano appuntiti come stalagmiti
Beato chi sta con Anna che anche se tutto va al contrario Anna resta uguale e lo ama
E io continuo a bruciare come paglia nel Sahara
Questo è per chi si è sentito solo con un padre che non chiama
Che non chiama
Per chi è cresciuto veloce tra autobus e metro
Per chi fa un passo avanti e due passi indietro
Chi, come me, al sedile posteriore pensa al futuro anteriore guardando oltre il vetro

La mosca in mezzo ai fiori trova l'unica merda
Decidi chi essere, ma è scritto, Dio è uno scrittore

Dopo la serata, quando torni a casa, ti fai due conti
Tiri le somme, metti a confronto, torni alle fonti
Zero gli sconti, tutto il tuo sangue, tutti i tuoi sforzi

Mamma lo sapeva, lei me lo diceva

Non ho mai chiesto, mai chiesto niente
Non ho mai chiesto, non ho mai chiesto

Questi guardano l'unghia spezzata
Mentre sei a terra accasciato per strada
Se vuoi seguire il cuore fai la cosa sbagliata
Il mio consiglio è prendi tutto e scappa dai radar
Qui se fai successo lo condividi
Ma poi se fallisci con chi la vivi
Rimbambire la testa di 'sti ragazzini
Frate non esiste tra i miei obbiettivi
La madre degli ingrati frate è sempre incinta

Meta mia è far paradiso, mica paranoia
Quando hai aperto la finestra stavo per pisciare

Come in Rorschach, come ora, proprio non capisco
Ora a Roma, bionda, mora, rossa, sangue, Cristo
Se non fumo dieci g, ogni g, Cristo
No che non conosci un cazzo di quello che ho visto
Quali costi? Li ho aboliti lungo il mio percorso
Che cucina Scavolini, cavolini arrosto
Tu maldita cosa dici, arrivi a fine giorno
Che ti occupi la bocca invece del soggiorno
Mi fa schifo chi fa il malandrino ma c'ha i soldi
Te la vivi a Tel Aviv, che sparano ai morti
Sedativi all'infinito finché non ascolti
Semplicemente mi sentivo perché arrivo a molti
Non mi conosci, ti cestino come file pacco
Se mi conosci, mingherlino, ""come fa a farlo?""
Ti riconosci nel bambino sempre quando parlo

Mentre tutto affonda impariamo a vivere dai cani
Siamo animali solitari col senso del gruppo, inseguiamo una lepre
Faccio foto straordinarie senza sviluppo e senza neanche una Reflex
Aironi appollaiati ma pronti a spiccare il volo dai balconi delle nostre abitazioni
Asserragliati in seminterrati di trenta metri quadri
Aquiloni che cercano il cielo e restano in qualche modo legati
Mi do per intero, il pensiero è il mio ministero che sposto a destra o a sinistra
A seconda dell'emisfero
Superstizione o più devozione al mistero?
E quando credo in cose in cui non capisco, mi dispero
Questa è una discesa in miniera per scovare un diamante
Anche se, se vuoi, per voi è solo una pietra
Filigrana prodotta da una filiera
Prima che una filiale non la rinomini volgarmente ""moneta""
Valore alle parole, calore alla carotide
Canto della mia vita, scrivo le sue fasi topiche in cui tutto è malattia
Comprese le svolte comiche e più che un disco nuovo
Vi sto scrivendo le cronache delle mie tare croniche

Rituale quindi è liturgia musicale
Con il cuore in una mano, il coltello in uno stivale
Perché niente è tanto personale che non si può raccontare
Venti giorni in cardiologia, enigma
Fantasmi nella trappola, chiamami Peter Venkman
E sto pregando Dio
Perché per me la sua presenza è spirituale
Il resto è teologia e speculazione clericale
Io, la luna all'apogeo non sono in pace neanche quando creo
Torneo, bucano il mio ozono sono come il Freon
È dal liceo che la mia vita è un gineceo

Solo così posso donarlo, ogni altra piega è un ripiego
Cerco asilo nell'assillo

Fino a che non vinco non potrò issare il vessillo

La mia barca è passata al varo
Imparo ad orientarmi senza mappa o faro
Qui è raro chi non rema al contrario
Scompaio come il tuo denaro quando il banco salta
In un mondo che esalta le capacità del baro
Stai tre metri sopra il cielo, sei paraletterario
Proiettili d'argento nel velluto, mi autonomino sicario
E mi sparo se stanotte muto in lupo mannaro
Ossessione, distruzione, tu e il tuo nome, malinconia
Luce che conduce fuori dalla galleria
Messo a sedere sul bordo del cratere
La gente mi chiede storie vere, tu che ne puoi sapere?

Una stagione qui dura poche sere ed è archiviata
Via lattea, la mia testa sbatte alla ricerca
Come l'uomo di latta senza che il cuore lo sappia

Catapultato in una vita nuova

L'umore sull'asfalto che camminava raso
Stanco e sporco con I capelli a caso
Pieno di lividi e un grumo di sangue al naso
Pronto a riniziare tutto ero come appena evaso,
Coi pensieri color canna di fucile
Che viravano sul verde di una bile in attesa di travaso
I nostri muri sono spaventose distese di mattoni e di rimorsi
Benchè il passato paia riproporsi
Ci siamo fatti tremare le vene ai polsi bevendo verità
A grandi sorsi, prima di raccontarti I miei
Mostri e prima di sapere I tuoi trascorsi
Cose che fanno feriti e morti prima ancora di indisporci

Io per te mi perderei e non m'importa niente
Se penso a come sei spericolato crimine,
Mi ero distratto a vivere e il destino ha mandato te
Un tempismo quasi infallibile, che a pensarci fa ridere

E nello spazio di un respiro dirti che tu sei
Come vorrei luce e buio infinito in cui

Caduta in braccio e neanche ti chiedevo
Unica tra mille dee senza velo venuta a farsi
Togliere le spine e pregare il mio mistero
Dagli occhi solo conferme, cerca in fondo ai miei quando vuoi riaverne
Macchina veloce fatta apposta per me
Che guido sicuro ed ho il piede leggero e le mani ferme
Il tuo corpo, il mio tempio
Metto in asse il nostro baricentro
A ogni impasse che starò vivendo
Rovista tra le lame sparse nel mio petto
Siamo come un esplosivo pronto a detonare
Questa fiamma ci fa innescare le cariche
Spiega le ali stiamo per volare
Noi due siamo un altro paio di maniche.

Le valigie in giro
E le promesse di portarla al mare un giorno prefestivo
Si vanno a fare fottere

Lontana, con una nostalgia che mi sbrana

Il mio lavoro tiene lontane le persone care
Ed è singolare che non riesca più a pensare al singolare
Non sono poi egoista come appare
Fuori guardo il mondo dietro a un oblò o dai finestrini,

Adesso un'orchidea ha presto il posto dei coinquilini
Arrivi a trent'anni ma poi vai in crisi, acquisti sicurezza
Ma il portafoglio è pieno di scontrini
Check in, check out, c'è più disincanto
Nel raccontare storie sul palco quando canto
Se mi ricordo come mi chiamo è già tanto
Sennò guardo il nome in alto sulla carta d'imbarco,
Ma ogni giorno qui è un esame
E mi sta stretto come i jeans di un denim designer,
Rotaie, catrame, voglio poter stare con lei, ok?

È una gara in cui questa vita vuole metterti
Ogni scala che verso il cielo fa la sua salita
È una sfida in cui certe volte devi perderti

Il muro avanti al tuoi occhi ha più di una crepa
La strada è cieca, ma ha due mani d’acciaio e un cuore di pletra
Tu vai maneggiato con cura in ogni tua plega
Sei fine porcellana tenuta dentro a una teca
Il reschio l’ha visto, nascosto in ogni storia
Perchè tristezza e gioia spesso si mischiano
Qui ci sono urla, quant’è difficile trovare la tua voce
La tua lingua e tradurfliela

Ogni strada che sembra non avere più l’uscita
È una gara in cui questa vita vuole metterti
Ogni scala che verso il cielo fa la sua salita
È una sfida in cui certe volte devi perderti

Transinato come in una danza vorticosa
Quando sai di avere tutto ma manca qualcosa
E ti fai film e viaggi, vai a rimuginarci sopra
La mente non riposa, i pensieri sono nastri di cellulosa
L’aspettativa spesso crea pathos, nemici immaginari, l’ansia da risultato
E scarichi la frustrazione in uno status
Senza capire che sei il primo ad aver sbagliato
Per te loro hano la colpa, loro sono il male che bussa alla tua porta
Ma a forza di ripeterlo diventi uno stereotipo a tua volta
Chi grida che è pulto spesso ha la coscienza sporca…
La testa alle cose migliori, l’aria nel polmoni ed il fumo fuori
Manovratori senza rotta, impariamo a nostre spese dagli errori
Col cuore nel calzini in attesa che un giorno voli

Sempre grintoso cerca di salutare quando sarai famoso
Noi lo sape sape sapevamo mi dicono
Lo sape sape sape sapevamo.

Parleranno sempre perché è l'unico piacere
Che si può permettere chi non sa tacere
Devi avere una visione e va oltre la visuale
Non è da dove vieni ma è dove vuoi arrivare

Ti rifà le domande dopo che le ha già risolte
Ti ridà le certezze dopo che te le ha tolte

In un mattino senza sole, senza sosta 
Tutte le cose buone non le ricordi e basta 
Una mattina dentro un bar, nell’ultimo tavolo 
Un caffè, un silenzio, quanto ti costa

Vedi che è sempre tutto un progetto aperto 
Non siamo nè la figlia modello nè il figlio perfetto 
Le scelte di cuore le prendo di petto, le pezze a colori 
La perfezione è solamente un concetto 

L’amore che lega o l’amore che ti nega 
Come una pietra al collo e il peso che ci annega 
Una pagina di vita che prende la sua piega

I tuoi segnali morbidi mi attivano
Tu sei il pianeta che mi attira a sè
Nel silenzio, tu mi colpisci
I tuoi fatali morsi mi rianimano
Perché il tuo siero buono gira in te

La bocca mastica il tuo nome, ma è difficile
Nel mio mirino sei un obiettivo sensibile
E provo a disegnare i tuoi contorni
Ma per certe cose non bastano i fogli
Uno dentro l’altro, è forza di gravità
Tra le tue gambe, fino in profondità
Pensarti nuda, con addosso gli stivali
Si contraggono gli addominali

Dio mio, certe cose sono complicate
Forse è per questo che le vuoi di più
Va via, o torna ancora
Preziosa mia, lama alla gola
Proprio tu, che non hai perché
Fottuta fantasia, che divora

Quando appari tu mi rapisci
I tuoi segnali morbidi mi attivano
Tu sei il pianeta che mi attira a sè
Nel silenzio, tu mi colpisci
I tuoi fatali morsi mi rianimano
Perché il tuo siero buono gira in te

Quando io e te
Stiamo per fare l’amore
Uno sull’altra, stesi nudi o in sei nove
Ma innocenti, finché in assenza di prove
Devoti a questa missione
In estasi e religione

Quando appari tu mi rapisci
I tuoi segnali morbidi mi attivano
Tu sei il pianeta che mi attira a sè
Nel silenzio, tu mi colpisci
I tuoi fatali morsi mi rianimano
Perché il tuo siero buono gira in te",Siero buono,2017
Ghemon,"La voce dentro grida e quando è così stronza preme 
Le lascio dire tutto, stavolta andrà come viene 
Il cielo si spalanca dopo che la pioggia piange 
Si poggia sulle facce, pesante 
Distendo le mie gambe qui seduto in riva all'argine 
Con una profezia sulla voragine 
Quasi convinto che si stia per compiere 
E provo a immaginare dove il fiume andrà 
Costretto a digiunare per necessità 
Per ritrovare me 
Lo lascio scorrere

Vuoi sapere adesso dove sono 
Sono come sotto un temporale 
Né un ombrello né un accappatoio 
Mi protegge dal male 
Queste mani dicono chi sono 
Se mi volto so che niente è uguale 
Questo amore che a volte imprigiono 
Mi protegge dal male

E te lo giuro sul mio nome certa rabbia so che faccia ha 
Ne ho la carne tra i canini e sto assaggiando che segreti sa 
Ribadisci che l'indifferenza cieca miete vittime 
Ed ora so perché mi dovrei proteggere 
Le gocce di sudore sulla polvere 
La volontà che gronda dalla fronte che 
Racconterà di me, che amavo correre 

Vuoi sapere adesso dove sono 
Sono come sotto un temporale 
Né un ombrello né un accappatoio 
Mi protegge dal male 
Queste mani dicono chi sono

Mi protegge dal male

L'inusitato cliché della mia confessione 
Grasso e benzina incendiano l'aria 
Puoi sentirne l'odore 
La terra si muove

Why can't you rescue me
'cause you've got all I need
I know I got to pay the price
Cheppin' through the streets at night
After a fuss and fight
Tears in my eyes I'm a man

So let me live before I die

Bottle twist the cap
To survive your life
Is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step by step and be versatile
Love peace and cash

And you always bring me a precious time
I love you more because
You bring sweet precious times",Seven Angels,2003
Gheorghe Zamfir,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2003
Gheorghe Zamfir,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Ghetto,"I'm a ghetto kid
So why the ghetto shit?
I dunno what happend its just what the ghetto did
I wear my trousers low
Almost near my knees
And every where you go you almost always get this beef

'cause I'm a ghetto kid
So I love ghetto chicks
And if we get together we could have a ghetto kid
I'll let these people know
Don't fuck with me
I've got my knife and I could get a 9 milli

I'm a ghetto kid
I said I'm just a ghetto kid

I'm a ghetto kid
East london were the metal is
Where big shotters lick out white mountains like everest
Most don't know were heaven is
Forgive me I'm rollin with deamon, I'm devilish
You all know that I never miss
I'm a beat specialist
Niggas know I'm blowin up shows like a terrorist
And if they don't know then tell 'em this
K to the izo N O
And fucking just remember this

I rip it for the ghetto kids
Some niggas don't even know were the ghetto is
Please nigga find me a glass, no
See me in see town and roll with the V6 east six east town
Its me man, I'm just me I'm a gan
I've been writin since P99
My hearts in the prison
I master the rhythm like heartless ambition

I'm a ghetto kid
I do ghetto shit",Ghetto Kid feat. Ghetto [Album Version] [Version],2005
Ghetto,"It's just one of those days
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just one of those days 
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
And now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep 
It's just typical me 
I must have one of them faces
Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

Innit
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just typical me 

I must just be unruly
So no-one call over Rudy 
But look at all the drinks he brought me
I drink too much when I was forty
Stand up to see a nuisance
A pest, a pain, a rage
The same shit happens almost every other day 
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

It's always Kano getting in the madness
Me I'm in the corner sippin' on Champers 
But for some reason, I gotta face the 'all' on a rampage
It's so typical 
I'm no little fool 
And no I don't wanna sit and talk 
I take a Mo and sip it all 
Everyday it is so predictable 
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to 
I have mixed feelings but I dunno what I'm gonna do 
So here's what is and what isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

'cause you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in 
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss
That's what you're doing
I'll try my best to not be aggressive
But it's one of those days",Typical Me Feat. Ghetto (Main Mix) [Album Version] [Version],2005

Ghetto Brothers,"[Al-D (Z-Ro)]
Screw (what's the deal my nigga)
Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

[Chorus: x2]

[Willean]
DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

[Al-D]
Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[K-Rino]
Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[Yungstar]
Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

I used to hang across that water that mighty nine and other sections
While lounging in the club, I packed a snub nosed Smith and Wesson
Fuckin' hoes, split the blunts and optimos, that's a war
These niggas out chea cut throat, so the crime rate never falling
It's a swamp nigga, we all ghost fuckin riders as we stunt niggas

Left in bloody puddles, so it's a must, I represent my jungle

Go to war with Calicos, sending niggas to their burial

When you see them niggas with the white handkerchiefs
You get to the land of the lost

Ya ain't even gotta question, if these Christopher Homes soldiers real
They knocking nuts off back in the cutoff, them niggas bout it too
You doubt it, go test 'em, you can be another bloody body too

Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there

Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap

Rest in peace Pac

Hopped out the drop, the drivers side of course
You seen me somewhere before, you did,

You know what I do when it's time to floss
I'm a do it, you know I ain't got time to talk
But I see somethin in the corner and she lookin kinda fly
I tell my dog Snoop (psst psst) 
man you might as well go ahead and stop me
(Lemme holla at you dog) She done met up with a star, eye contact
I nodded, she nodded back, then we met up at the bar
I told her I keep ice on my wrist, tight keep ice on my chin
And I'll still respect you tomorrow, and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose
And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose
In a minute I'm a hop in my ride, if you in this cool
If not ya gotta make a decision by the time I finish my food
Now what

Now I used to be on the block, 
now I'm in the drop chillin with Snoop
But I walk through the door I feel animosity (oh you feelin it too)
Probably cause we say our name we could be stealin they booth
Probably cause I'm platinum, we dark, could be chillin at two
(The south west connect, big chains on our neck
Boy give us respect, y'all shit on deck)
Aight Snoop, you got the weed (yeah) and I got the liquor (fa sho)
Meach got the food but who got the strippers (I don't know)
Cause ain't no party like the ones we drove (whassup)
And um, ain't no cars like the ones we drove 
And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin, call us, it's outta control
(So whether it's summertime, winter, spring or fall
Look for somethin big from Silkk and Top Dogg)
We party with nothin but bud, nothin but thugs
East to west, peep the best, keep it stress, nothin but love (yeah)

Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride.

Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad

Tried to make this thang work

Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

That you were just too damn ghetto for me

Oooh ahh, Ghetto Ma-fi-a
Comin at you live I mean
And we we just, don't know no
stress, we just roll up Devine and ride
In Decatur
Blowin up like some MegaMen (bitch)
Dodgin all you chickenheads
Did you hear just what I said?
Our destination is the hood
and we quickly comin your way

Verse One:

Uhh, I remember trampin, late at the sto'
Had no idea, what I was in fo'
  Just me and my nigga, supplyin fiends
  Broke as hell, we're chasin dreams
See it may seem, like we can't come up
But we a team, Nino, keep your head up
  From sun-down to sun-up (what?)  I'm a hustler
  Gotta get my gun up, we're quick to tussle
We had to muscle, for a crack position
Niggaz didn't want to let us roll, had no intention
  And not mention, we had to shoot it out
  Lives of a lynchin, had you hidin out
But now we ridin out, in the Delta
Tryin to grind it out, without no shelter
  You shoulda seen us serve them niggaz like a waiter
  ... in Decatur

* Chorus *

Verse Two:

Now we were tight, like Mike and Pip'
Rob a nigga, they bet' not slip
  See I'm equipped (with what) with a nine and a dope bomb
  I've been trampin so long, people call me dog
Where you from?  Straight From the Dec
But shit is real, you got to ride with your rec
  Uhh, we stole Big Boi's car, and got our strip on
  We got the rims the music, and the cell phone
Then we would drink, drink til we fell out
If bitches don't fuck, they got put out
  And you didn't sell out, crunk up the jury
  I paid your way out, gave you the fury
Yeah, fools know we real, cause they dap us
Niggaz know we on, cause they shop with us
  Just show me a team that's greater
  .. from Decatur

* Chorus *

Verse Three:

See they all know, we got the steel
We got tires, and Adams, and Thomasville
  Yeauh, I know you real you hold your own in any hood
  In Prarie Homes, Carver Homes, and Hollywood
Kirkwood and Summer Hill they spoke it real
I'm here flippin grindin, gotta pay a bill
  Yo, I pack the steel, got no time for the switchblade
  I was out my mind when I trapped off ? aid
See, every dime we stuck, they was stole
Make most of my money (off where) off Candle Road
  I gotta kill my pressure, they had me hot
  Hoes on the strip (where) in Flint Rock
Never buy our dope, without a scale
Learned that while I was trampin, in Scottsdale
  And did I mention, we livin greater

What you know is who you are, who are you?
Do you know who you are in the world? what is your world view?
What do you go through? , what has your life showed you?
What are you learnin in this so called life?
Do you have principle or do you blow with the wind
Do you wanna be free but don't know where to begin
Do you know your enemy from your friend, even you can
It's deep in this scannin the system that keepin us here
Will we survive, do you believe, are we afraid
Would you rather have control of your life, or be a slave
Show me a sign, a pig ain't no homey of mine
They own me what's mine, I show you if you loan me your nine
I'm only concerned for tables to turn
When the people learn the truth about the system, the cities will burn
And I stand firm, like chaka zulu, these crackers can't stop you
Who you?

People searchin for answers, where to begin
Capitilism born from the backs of blacks
White folks relax, live off the kick backs
Gettin work to the bone jo, build this country
Further exploided by class to make money
Filthy rich capilist with blood loot
Use main frames systems to bank and compute
With the next technology, credit to the wires
Internet growth the man more suppliers
Welfare, ederly checks and wage workers
All us, elephants trapped in they circus
Ain't fightin over man made chips no more
When the lights go out, it's gonna belong to the poor

Dem crazy, dem crazy

Ghetto-E,"Find the culprit who's snitching me out (all right)
Follow that bastard and learn his route (uh-huh)
I want to know who imparticuler he's talking to
Kill 'em all and kill the bitch who let him in my crew

Type a letter to the bureau of investigation
Tell them hoes that they can't infiltrate my operation

Keep see-4 mounted under my establishment
Wait for you hoes come inside with no evidence

This shit is bigger than Mafia hits
Dapper don with the ensemble of killers and shit

Leer jet ready to take off to the Costa Rica
Blunt smoking and Dom sipping when my hookers seat ya' 

Soldiers quiet, but I'm still angry when the plane lands
Members greet me Italian suits with a light tan 
Goddamn!

I know it's time to see the big shot whose got
Buildings and yay yo and guerilla armies on the spot

Moments later we pull up into a secluded jungle
My crew was behind us but got lost when we turned in a tunnel

Sunshine, sea breeze, golf tee's, palm trees
This shit's unreal but my man is living it with ease

Waiter brings me cappuccino
His name is Nino
Retired enforcer for the New York based Gambino

Godfather comes out and takes a seat across from me
5 foot 9, medium build, look about 63

He said I heard you catchin' pressure
J'oo feeling the heat
We hear you're mobbin' in the streets

You got to set it off!!!

(Telephone conversation)
 Boss: Hello?!
 Bootleg: Hello boss I hope I'm not disturbing you
Members of d'cappo told me to notify you this morning about a shipment that's 
coming in. 

 Boss: J'yea, I heard there's a drought out there in Michigan where j'oo at
I'm gonna send j'oo a thousand kilo's of cocaine
I want j'oo to sell it all
And j'oo send me my money
Bootleg: Well lets get paid
(conversation ends)

Fuck what you doin' now I'm boss!!!
Sippin' on Remi
Making reservations for the weekend Korea
Drug keeping over see a

Dedication and loyalty
Is the key if you want to get paid like a G
Promotions cross oceans
Big bank keeping up with dope policy

Now when we 
Step off the plane
Keep cool and don't offend me
Never speak unless you're spoken to
This man has keys to send me

Take a wolf pack
Stay strapped and ready to attack on these coast guards
No mishaps!
Perhaps
You'd rather take a train with the 'caine I'll arrange that

Are you with that?
When you get back
Contact Texas and our L.A. staff
Never let that
Cocaine get out of your sight
Whole keys don't fuck with halfs

Now if you get stopped at the gate
there's one thing you must promise me
Before you cross me
Just think about death before dishonesty

Don't call me
Unless there's an emergency to attend to
I'll send you 10 niggas with fully automatics 
To defend you

In a few days that shipment should arrive
Better send some scouts out
Keep a look out
Send two or three niggas on the coast
Standing post with they glocks out

No problems
Just follow instructions everything comes out lavishly
We'll solve 'em
Our mission is to make money fast
And to make money flawlessly

Start stashing
When the coc's all home
Contact money paid workers and separate

Pimp action
20 steps from the club
And we cool, bring cheese to

You come from a family of wealth, I had to grab it myself (facts)
I earned all three of those trophies on mum's front room cabinet shelf
In economy thinking about first class 'cause I ain't your average male
Reppin' and your man did well, rules have to bend if plan b failed
Them boy they say they want smoke, we puff puff give and we hand them L's

All I'm saying, you'll hear 'caution' playing

There's no way back from here, core fan base, we go back some years
Reload that one there, core fan base, we got back some years

It must be the boy the Deebo'd the atmosphere

This all happens when man spits verses
Since I been bad man have been nervous
Running this tempo, calorie burning

My brothers and sisters, welcome to service
You ain't gotta be Muslims or Christians, to believe or worship

I gotta testify, wish brothers more life
And the same brothers wanna see an end of mine
I been praying everyday, there's a big .45 on a friend of mine
I cannot control what other men decide as long as they don't effect how I spend my time

Grime!
Rumble Times and that
Yeah man I'm still waving the flag

I'm a grime kid
I might conquer another genre
I'm fonder
But there ain't nothing like this
From my homper stomper
It's got a lot stronger
But Logan's still working the night shift
We all came from the bottom no sponsor
Independent from the entrance
Grime is jungle, '96
Garage in '99
And I'm ready to rumble
Me and my clique
MCs can't stand me
I'm antisocial when I'm angry

I ain't one of the man that are doubting it
I love the sound of it
That rapid percussion
Nocturnal strings
Lewi White baseline
Maniac melody
I'd rather that than a beat from Alchemist
So don't ask what genre my album is
I've be blessed on the buttons
I might get another one in the charts
You think man are calling them blessed for nothing, nah
This harddrive's got a thousand hits
And guess what, Zdot's the next stop
So man are giving him a shout for dis
And I might grenade a beat Wiley made
When it comes to grime I be highly trained
I should have been on the first Pow!
But it's way to late for complaints
And I make a lot of MCs feel like they're leveling, yeah
I could take Usain in a race
How is it these

Pain ain’t the emotion I wanna feel but I’m thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I’ll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It’s dark when I’m about just me myself and my shadow
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind’s infected with terror
No wonder I’m under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that I’m more than a hood track!

Ooh, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh, but you will never drown me out
Ooh, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out

You can’t ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around about 6'1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I’m choking? Seriously, do I sound like I’m joking?
I’m floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, I’m maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it’s in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I’m broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I don’t wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I’ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don’t wanna see this guy survive.

Ooh, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh, but you will never drown me out
Ooh, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh, but you will never drown me out, out, out

My daughter, she a princess
The world ain't slaughtering her skin yet
These Kayne's have not become important to the Kim's yet
But when she gets older there'll be brothers 
Same colour as her Papa who will not be showing any sort of interest
Have mercy on my brothers yea
Disrespecting women who remind them of their mothers
Disrespecting women who remind them of their sisters
Disrespecting women who remind them of their cousins
Have mercy on my brothers
Everyone's entitled to their own taste
But every time you pricks make a statement I can find a rival in my own race
I love all types a women
Variety is ok
But society will throw shade
So tell me who's fighting for the sisters then
When their own brothers keep on dissing them
Try and picture Justin as a little one
Daddy was around but I was raised by the women them
Nan, aunts, mummy, black woman significance
So fuck you and your ignorance
When I was young I had Ashanti on my wall
And there was pictures of my family in the front room with certificates
University graduates and good citizens
Baby keep doing you, don't let the world ruin
No matter what they say you are beautiful
Beauty's in the eye of the beholder
And we don't know who is who
Who are they to slew when they slewing you?

Keep you golden
So golden
I need you golden
So golden
I can't cry those tears for you
Again
But just know I'll be there for you
To keep you golden
And they say sticks don't break no bones
But their words might still hit home
Broke up bags on concrete stones

Killing each over minor (problems)

My left is weak but my right is stronger
What I really mean is my writing's stronger
Should I wife a Kate or should I wife a Rhonda
I don't mind either genre
Brothers back home using cake soap
I'm only caked up 'cause I make doe
We're all try stay afloat in the same boat
But I'm trying to be the goat not scape goat
Are you aware of who I am?
There's something called opinions and I really can't escape those
Eww he's black and he's ugly
Nah I'm black and i'm lovely
Only god can judge me
This ones ones for my brothers that are lonely in this fuckree
Coming home from school and your shadows your only company
Really I'm from Africa but I don't know the country
I'm a lost man
Where the hell are my locks at?
Got me looking at a dashiki like, ""What's that?""
And still I'm Django to you house niggas
I get even with the Stevens in combat

Your love is a dragster wave. It makes us breath like two machines
Flower lust, my hurricane, you turn my blood into gasoline

Could be right in time, and can you see?

Balenciaga wrist, a gift from the kid
But we stay beefin, boo with no broccoli
Every time I come in the crib I'm in a hot seat
Breaking all my watches, gold plate Versace
You said you didn't mean that shit cause you was toxic
Probably argue everyday as a hobby
We used to be like Claire and Bill Cosby
So what the hell, we held hands on the regular
Writing ""I love you"" on napkins on the table, love
Capiche, depends on the season
Cause as soon as June July hit, we beastin'
Not speaking, it increases
Feel like my love had to depletion
Then we get back together, that's decent
But last week you keep my Benz and that's recent

She's high maintainence, she lacks patience
But for her love there's no replacement
Face to face, waste to brace and men chase to taste it
Most will get strung for the first engagement
I met her on the downtown streets down east
Now it seems she's always around me
And our love has astounded me, bounded me
There's no way I can break free
A servant to her will, I'm emerging to her feel
I pour my heart out and she let my love spill
Out on the floor when love change to war
Both tryna win, tryna claim galore
Infatuation, walking fabrication
Kept alive through imagination
Opposite sides attract and collided
The collision was a bad decision
Two lovers trapped in one prison
Tryna separate like nuclear fission

Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up

You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the cheese got low
'Cause Toney, can't be out there pushing that blow
You made plans and dreams, not grands of schemes
I wanna search for the meaning of love, see what it means
'Cause we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall, for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soul mates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen

Uh, still applying the pain
The purple frying my brain, this woman's crying again
She, tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
That's what happens when you wife 'em and they try to tighten the chain
See, she in the right, so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe, I can feel her biting my chain
She, got her own, I ain't gotta buy her a thang
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the game
We, go together like, Martin and Gina, but
She get uptight when we fight like Ike and Tina, so
Love her or leave her alone, like I ain't need her tho
A minute later I'm back, like I ain't mean it, yo
We break up, just to make up, she fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A plus
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that

Ride around, and yo, fuck with my neighbors
Pocket full of hundreds and weed, light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, riding through SoHo
You hear the little baby in the back? That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz'll make you a sweet night
And chill with the pawns we on, cuz life is a chessboard
You better have you sword and vest on

And apologize to you  (if you really loved me you would've stayed with me) 
(And apologized to me, that's all I asked for) 'cause that ain't my style 
(Well let me hear what you had to say earlier) 

I remember how we met it was on the train 
How could I forget you smiled and looked at me 
The soft of your lips, they captured me 
The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other 
And then we sat, down together 
You gave me your number, said give me a call 
I thought I wouldn't call at all 
Here we are fell in love like hand to glove 
Pure bliss from above 
Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight 
We never seem to get it right 
See, there's too much fire, so much desire 
So it took a little time to take me higher 
I'm sorry if I hurt you and I went astray 
I guess we gotta call it a day 

I can't fall down on my knees (on my knees) 
And apologize to you (to you) 
'Cause that ain't my style (that ain't my style) 

I remember one night when we were home alone 
You were on the sofa, I was on the phone 
You overheard me call out my best friend's name 
That's when you went crazy, started going insane 
Grabbed the phone from my hand 
Backed me against the wall 
Shouting and asking who was on the call 
You wouldn't believe me when I said it's just a friend 
That's when all the madness began 
You kept yelling wild, I fell to the floor 
Crying in hysteria can't try w'you no more 
I knew you had a temper, I wish I didn't see it 
You wanted me to be faithful, I told you I could be it 
But that didn't stop you from putting your hands on my face 
You simply said you had to put me in my place 
At the end of every tunnel there's always a light 
And the door, it sure looks right 

That's why
I can't fall down on my knees (on my knees) 
And apologize to you (to you) 
'Cause that ain't my style (that ain't my style)
I can't fall down on my knees (on my knees) 
And apologize to you (to you) 
'Cause that ain't my style (that ain't my style)

Crying in your sleep, making you believe him 
But you're stronger than you'll ever know girl 
You control your own world, no need to take no more
He's got you begging on your knees 
Crying in your sleep, making you believe him 
But you're stronger than you'll ever know girl 
You control your own world, no need to take no more 

Yo, heh, yo I asked you to calm down 
Asked you who was on the phone, put the horn down 
You had a glass of wine, a Versace nightgown, a lime-green one 
That I bought you for your trip from the cruise you won 
I don't want to fool with those male friends 
I told you back then when we first got together 
I don't trust those men and you did it again 
I lost my temper, laid down and wrecked the house boo 
That's all I can remember, I'm sorry 

I can't fall down on my knees (on my knees)

Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

Dead in your face, straight RZArect you

I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill

Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real

Corner sittin wine niggaz sippin Apple Boone, this ain't no white cartoon

Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept? Stand up

Iron Man be sippin' rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aimin' knives which stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine and great Henry the Eighth
Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don

I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented
This unprecented, opium-scented, dark-tinted

Designin the fly shit and stay shinin and
The rza pours more beats than cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to black
With 50 other niggaz on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want some
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pullin out macs for fun

The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguin emcees, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggaz are timid, and nobody knows
How we move like wolfs in sheep clothes
Producin data, microchips or software
Undaground and off air, the land of the lost
Notorious henchman from the north
Strikin niggaz where the Mason-Dixon line crossed",Guillotine (Swordz),1995

Took thirty g's worth of jewels of that nigga)

Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate
They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens
I told you, money stated with the night beams, and two rings

Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath
Here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast
The full blast

Then skate to the next state
Further upstate, I heard they got crazy weight
Bagged up by the gates, in crates like disco breaks
Yo look out for Jakes, give it all it takes
Let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo Blake, niggaz don't fink, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape
It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes
Drug related, paper talkin bout the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the Big see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth

The rap scar is on rap chrome
Put it on seal it on, we're silicone
Spark it on your Talkathon
This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bar clones, war tones, raw tones
Blowin out the door, bones but
Your rap's fraudulent, float in these rap quarter inches
Reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got NIGGAZ here to play with you
You know the steez you know my whole program
Brothers from the No-Lands, all we want is the G's
Guns and grams, livin fat like the Hoffa
Mafia, sippin eatin pastas
Layin in the house tellin the seeds about the sagas
Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly
Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly
I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees
Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, takin no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse",Knuckleheadz,1995
Ghostface Killah,"It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know, someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz, getting through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life, the street life, whoa",Rainy Dayz,1995
Ghostface Killah,"Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, the things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual

Perhaps bullets bust niggas discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building niggas building, like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack sales bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GS's, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew feel 'em like swords

With the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop
In the 'nile, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up duke I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was wiling
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got juxed!""
Sharpened toothbrushes, 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block",Verbal Intercourse,1995
Ghostface Killah,"No man all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know

Yeah, runnin the streets, know it's deep
Word up, check his technique, yeah

Flippin the, marvelous track
Yeah
You know the steelo, but yo, yo
Check the bangin sounds that I invent
Fake niggaz who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga
Wit his back against the wall
Heads clapped once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin on Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit a switch
And yo, I had to step to her in a manner
and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em
Especially, when you're browsin, goin fishin
Your wasteline, bangin like a bassline
Physical form is well complexed
And yo, I love your outline, Boo
Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong
You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust
And yo, your stee is high potent, yo
We can go the distance, I put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted
I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it
Word up, yo, straight up and down yo
Check the joint, baby

Burn like the deserts of Mugabe, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
Thirty-six chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture

Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

God stepping forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

None, they want guns

Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells more like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid

How old are you boy?

Thirteen?  Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again

Ghostface Killah,"It's assassination day, I stalk

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line
I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter
From the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark
Pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered
My unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible
Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retreat through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God
His shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra
UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops know
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

Throw a blade, fuck gettin' laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Big-dick Wallies have never half-suede
Connectin' with the hot style is done

I run with nothin' but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M.

Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on

You oughta five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory

I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance

I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards

Mentally stripped em one God turned Christian
She know magic, soaking wet pussy on the matress
Skin like Cleopatra's, the leading actress
She been fucking since we went to fourteen, look at Miss Thing
With a ponytail kept a jar of Vasoline
She's a big girl now, with a body that growl

Police barricade, sidewalk crowded like parades
The arena now present, de event of the decade
Long braids and fades, baldheads, spangle waves
extensions, nails Friday, just got paid
Headliner or marquee is the prime time rhyme crime family
That shines Godly light
Upon this hip-hop art form, yo Dunn
We can't be measured by no chart, the God brung
Never bust premature for sure
You want it raw, let me plant my dynamite bitch
deep inside your core, the explosion stops the menstruation
Causes stomach inflation
Patiently waiting nine months for deportation
Of the Earth from the Moon, black woman stay in tune
Yo God, let me pour y'all the science about the womb
It's a black hole for those who lose control
Fertile soil before you are wise
And spoiled many men and took many lives
And all you brothers changed sides
Only worth a decimal compared to those who died inside",Marvel,1996

He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, ""I Miss You"" written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original, neighborhood, criminals
Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildest niggas peeling caps known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clapping
Slept in his principal spreads, threads, made of satin
Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he should of kept it real and went for kill
Cause if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will
But, shit will never calm down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off
Money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relax like he lived in there
Two kids was beaming him, them niggas from the movie theater
One had all Guess on, looking like he had a vest on
The other felly pell tucked with a firearm
Moving slow, baseball hats, crazy down low
Word life God, this bull kag nigga gotta go
Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5, G headed King Tudpea
About the size of Little Maurice

Don't move don't even flinch
Fix em up, drop the head, don't want to get blood in the tux
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbing him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Randy came out wacked out with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tud head and the cash
Then he shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass

How can I survive without bubbling weight?
It's prepared for the stand off, once you hand off
that white rock, and then give birth to a knot
Your biggest dream was to rock your 850 and beam
You and the Gods buy a crib in the white part of Queens
But at the same time, niggas on the block is ill
Some'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills
Being watched all day like enemy's prey
Faces, you never seen before is in your hallway
Brothers you knew for years is mad pussy and scared
Back in the days U.F.O.'s couldn't walk up in here
It's time to motor, travel like a foul order
Clear my head, stay sober, the soul controller

All these shameless niggas armed with cherry-red Bally's
On the twenty-fifth, everybody rich is getting married
Killed for power beans, your brother own schools in Medina
Vaseline lips is cracked cause they all had dreams
They overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru
Tropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo
Olympic minds quick flash like a leak on
A hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch em get they feast on
Royal blue lies inside the eyes of heaven
Curse the head, who speak foul and jinx number seven (seven)

Go off in airports, biographies, prophecies
Watch me set it, real key-ons hold down the desert
And walk with a famous name like Supreme Magnetic

Sitting high, looking fly, drinking on the best wine

Yo bitch I fucked your friend, yeah you stank hoe
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega-shit, bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stacking boucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where's you at, hoe? 'Pinky house, she put in my perm'
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chicken-head hoe, eatin' heroes
I'm the first nigga that had you watching flicks by DeNiro
You gained crazy points, baby, just being with God
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
You didn't do the knowledge what the God was manifesting
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleedin, held you down in malls
Sexually you worshiped my di-dick like a cross
I had you fiend out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranked
But you had to fuck this rasta-head ass nigga
I should of slapped ya but the Gods said chill
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab""
I'm wondering how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low hoe, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screaming while you was biting on my cables
Whistling to the washing machine, I threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest so-called rape
I'm God, cipher divine love my pussy real fine
That means clean the FDS smell with a shine

I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes

Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords

Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong

Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen

I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back

Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7

And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV

When a twelve ounce bottle of Bartyle and James had him startled
A bitch threw it caught him in his head, at full throttle
He fell, the glass crashed, he wasn't saved by the bell

He saw me stashin, like a pipe-link for mega fiends

Peep through the heavy small get the camoflouge

Fiends know me for my blue bags, besides smackin crabs
and earnin mine, this bitch Sha cat, gotta get his back bent
What the hell just made him fuck with my intelligent?
Back to Polly and I heard some noise we pack a two twelve
There go Lord Shamel, faggot made a sale
He's sellin my shit, I should slap fire out his ass
Snap his bones in half and watch the stock market crash
I walked up on him, he had the nerve to say Peace God
Ain't nuttin Peace God, you stole it now we out in the streets
Take your shit off, nigga you soft, back up off
Youse a shady nigga, I'm a sever fig you with a gloss
I snuffed him, threw a crazy left and I cuffed him
Allah don't like ugly so I held back from bustin him
I passed the burn off, he caught me from the blind side
Tapped a nigga jaw, I shot my fifty-two style, and crazy raw
I had my ice on, tapped a few times, he started leakin
De King with the deadarm, Shamel fell to his knees and
He started wheezin, losin his breath from smokin trees and

Yo Yo Yo doodododododo Yo pssh yo 
Yo park the jeep on the street of the Sunset Marquis 
Autograph sign and pass wit a gold tip sharpee 
Permanent ink blots undrunk from velly poo scotts 
All you faggots try to judge my shit like Ed Koch 
Underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared 
Plea the ams radio tapes that he jammed 
Golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home 
Flip the track of the beat watch Bobby flip the metronome 
High voltage, keep my seat in winsbro cultured 
Kill enemies by mailin them the poison glue postage 
I open and fold ya thought he fucked a ogre 
I leave the cats the book of food stamps ???? 
The box of evil a fifty sack of that lethal 
Adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from keebu

What party can you go to 
And I ain't there you bitches actin like they don't care 

[RZA] 
You bitches actin like you don't care 
You bitches actin like you YO 
Razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks 
Golden platinum things unstainable 
I chew rocks 
Slipe wit type digital soup deflect bullets 
Black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded 
Land, like my cousin dusty dirty as dan 
Fucked the daughter of the leader of the Ku Klux Klan 
Tapes we dub pound you wit the ace of club 
Climb your tree to a shub 
Tongue kiss a lion and kidnap her cub 
Passin it portrait 
My bitch spread eagle wild orchid 
Pussy so wet you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick 
Tickle the tonsil you could hear her coughin 
I don't know if Dirt fucked Mariah, but I'm out to fuck Tyra 
Starks might fuck Mya 

[ODB] 
I'm the pussy vampire 

[Chorus] 4X 
[Ghostface] 
Yo I'm bent out three days two nights yo I'm spent out 
One hell of a cruise New York got they hand out 
Like I owe somethin, check they stance they frontin 
I'm two seconds fromt wistin ya'll shit over nuttin 
All a sudden ice grills kid you did a baby bid 
In a minute almost hung yourself slit ya wrists 
To the maximum hand me the forty I'll thrash and 
Split out guests wit gash lemon goes throw his laz gone 
Trama the block pro bar sledge slang ho 
Runnin from to and sharles some rap and I might blow 
World cup, some been blessed wit the Stanley 
Yvonne lendl ordered lamb racket wit the cam key 
Sideline maneuver, polish wax MC remover 
Niggaz wit long nails cuttin me leavin bruises 
Candle lows tied a thousand an ya'll froze 
Came home an dust that doo tryin to play me close 
We've been peaked for years now Liz wants to choppin the kid 
I might do magic make him disappear 
Rearose that nigga Isotoner Coca-Cola holder snap the granola 
Sprinkle ginko polish 
Venom from a cobra lace in the come he brought older 
Soaked through a strainer here's a doser 
The King James version is paid just like Samsung 
Wit effects that'll kill rogers double O seven 
Hanna Barbera hops the opposite abandoned the deer 
Fuck wit mics like Sonny and Cher 
Or maybe captain entenail, connect and then blow the seal 
Nice like mister whittendale your girl Chippendale 
Shallah bridge all up in ya dog dial trench 
When I snatched that shit was broke shoulda sent ya ass back 
And where's the key to the hatchback pop that 
Get in throw a bag full of mice and then respect that

When wet lense stolers, lex glowers who owe us
Call up comissionary gordon, son go warn the warden
That the lord is back, rollin with his sword again

Shells that's hollow, six whipper through the 52 globe of horror

Prohibition got my whole block pissin christians
One-fifty-one dunn'll have you off balance walkin
Don't let your e-motions get involved talkin
To the wrong culprit, the killer be the soft spoken
So what's ya intentions, you want to glow for the moment? 
Throw on ya two pennys then you boltin
I rock for the few chosen, who got they third minds open
Write a page that'll engage war and encite fights
Be on the look for the bright lights and north winds
The trumpets be the mics ya size malevolent
You don't be long in my evesight, pee's a powerful soldier
Of the light and things won't be the same

Mc ultra high-brolic bank roll alcahol vulture
Garlic balls dice the shield of ocre
Tally ho pitty-pat backgammon pro
Pink salmon five spring rolls know me, you love my intro
Half a face wig sewed together like manhattan chase
Lookin like statue of praise, check behind the drapes
Castor troy layin for travolta mic gun pump
Layin on the floor clark's bleedin watermelon chunks
Hold up... sprinkle the hash, tony chapstick
Snatch rza last piece of fish right off the glass dish
Butter roll beats bagel tracks wavey hair decks
Lay it down straw hat style, butterball crown
Time life investments, when broke I wrote the old testament
Crashed domes now perform excellence
Words with the president, brunch with yeltsin
Gorbachev under meth's nuts, he out in belgium
Six and a half monkeys, twelve nazis
Four disappear, three eight two one flash to thin air
God's replica no wheel drive motionless mind cresica
Tilt the hat like esther

Chorus

[pete rock]
Aiyyo, I rumble into action, son I'm right on target
Legendary status with the way the track started
It's on, at any second with the high stakes
Drama, the game's teeth sharp like pirahana
There's a million style biters who try to create
Make no mistake real niggaz challenge the fake
Most valuable sp-1200 gold medals

The original, pete rock is like soul on ice
Dynamite with the mic device
Now roll the dic, for the game of death
Snake eyes baby pah, the boy wonder's a threat

Heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie

Gambino Cappacino to the Afro Sheen
Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Through the damage to the wannabe Flipmode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers 
My word of mouth it's all real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin large
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound 
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromisin
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggaz not keepin it real
Dirtball niggaz that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggaz I be wantin on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats and my man keep em bustin till he's gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
'Donna come through everyday my uniform
changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggaz get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack kid
Watch how the slang hits you, just like the fat kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
on a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean

Thug therapist, my clan's too original
My slang bang to wax, words that's visual
Too digital for y'all common street criminals
Who want to come test, lick the sweat from my genitals
We can get off the mic and get a little physical

Cord, I swing swords, behold the prolifical
Rhyme writer, hip-hop provider, prize fighter
Live wire, quick to set the mic on fire

I quote murderous notes, dope rhyme supplier
Hang glide on the mic like a stunt driver

The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy",Right Back at You,1999

Precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels
Holding a navy blue uzi
Krush Grooving waves off the atlas
Cooling, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasing

Dressy, salad bar style Nestle

Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beaming, fagot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck!
Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designing on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backing me

A hail storm, ice raining, mind containing
Info, nigga what you in for? Complaining
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speaking through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flaring gunmen
Hate to see me coming like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm hugging
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick

Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight
Throwing light went off and in the basket

Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet

Disguised ourselves as the cidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly

In she came with the same type game
The hairdo, Prada shoes, brand new Gucci frame
Big thangs, so big you can't hardly explain
When she done crossed her legs, she make mind turn insane
Had seen her on the ave and spotted her, how I wanted her
Ass so fat she (?) fella
What you lo-lo-love, expert in the bedwork corridor
Man see a touches her, man you'll feel sorry for

I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more

But then something got out of hand

Why is it that you just lose control

The kid walked through, switch up his accent, now I'm from Paris
Cash the bill, frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinking? You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Gallants, hitting if we got to
Busting at y'all niggas daily
Wall to wall, Hawkins
Sucking your teeth cause God chain-talking
Like Ghostface this, Ghostface that
Ghost sold crack, now we revelations spoken through rap
Veloured down like the sheik of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans, Michael Davis, it's me against housing
Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks, Apollo rap Fredick Douglas
You know what? A-yo, fuck this
A-yo, how can I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions, put it together
It's simple ain't it? Well, quite clever

Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin, ugh
2Pac, Biggie, ohh how we miss you so
We want y'all both to know
We really love you so

A-yo, I'm Gucci down
Wally boot, Jamaican hat, long 4-pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Don't speak much, deluxe plush imaginations
Hold a note like Willie Hutch
You might've bumped into me on the Rikers bus
Weed in my cheeks, gem in my beauty sleep sleeve
Dead serious, knowledge by 2% triple geese
Come on, we juggle mic's
Three Card Molly, amps advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night, Jamaica
Came through in a booger green '68 Pacer
Mad paper, high as a fuck
Truck, two rappers got stuck that night
I ain't saying no names, they know who, thank you for the change
Outdoor event, New Year's Eve, Cali weed
30 seconds til we tear and decease
Quick, call all my seeds dipped in the crowd
The ho spotted me, he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly, we exactly
Formed like Christ and the disciples
Black fatigues, lethal-faced dunnie, he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook
Your favorite rappers dropping they drinks
On the low tucking they links
We made eighty off the books

One of the illest since Magic Johnson, no disrespect
With metaphors that keep me out the Project
Rap connects'll keep me correct
A-yo, I wrote this on Donnie roof
After his funeral, on one knee
Thinking his killer's following me
So to my nigga Donnie, up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?
You got beer, weed, guns, AIDS
All these obstacles, it's hard to make it nowadays
Why's the Devil winning, some say it's our fault
If that's the answer, you know smoking cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginning cause that's how they rewind
Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine, and we don't drink wine
If you don't bring me some motherfucking cognac, I kill you
I can't feel you
Ain't in my senses, and you ain't in my dollars
I fuck with rottweilers, no leashes, no collars
Brolic scholars, that's Ghost Deini",Ghost Deini,2000

I'm gonna do it for ya [Repeat: x4]

New Ghostface!

Yo deep in the trenches
Wig, young black green beret
Chrome laser guns blazing at spades
Wallabies, cherry noose, cool-aid
10 niggas call it Tai-Chi
Black blades, one hundred dollar seats
Hold up, we at the opera
Queen Elizabeth rub on my leg
Had ketchup on her dress from a whopper
Chunky ass necklace
Must be her birthstone
John Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome
Told ya eyes up on her prince
Fucking with Diana
Two rows across, Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White
Fingering Pamela Lee
We on the balcony
Dare one of y'all to Malcolm X me
Somebody might catch a Kennedy
Yo let me adjust my lens
Through these binoculars
I paid 5 g's sliding off like Kid Vitamin
Viking
Patriot of Broad Street
Bet you think I'm laying like a hyphen

Tony Starks make the narc's dogs bark
With the Benz parked
Up against the boulevard
Starks had the bone sparked
One cop tapped the window glass
Like a cymbal crash,
""What the fuck son! You trying to break glass?""
He flashed his badge,
""License and registrations""
At that moment
His fat partner started chasing
Chicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacing
For snatching gold
Trying' to dip into the god's basement
Our location
Lead steel shed spread
Cracked shorty head
Left sweetie there for dead
Ghetto poodles
Fingers sticky from cheese doodles
Starving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles
Neighborhood sick wit' it
Clinton 'bout to cut WIC
Maybe one y'all rich rap niggas need to politic
Reach for the sky
They throw bleach in your eye
Don't teach you why
You be keeping 'em high
Dipped like an Oreo cookie
In cold milk, bold silk
Gold-filled cap, Wu wear hat,
Low tilt
True Islamic
We speak verbal rhyme phonics
Why y'all trying to change this hip hop to technotronics?

Don't go against the grain (the grain) [Repeat: x3]

Girl!

Because of you I'm hurting
Within my within my heart
I know it's not right to be flirting
But a relationship has to start
You're the one that I'm clocking
It's time for you to start jocking
Don't want you to see me cry
This is why this is why this is why

I met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder

Hey yo god don't fuck with her!

I met this girl named Liz she was all in the biz

Hey yo lord don't fuck with her!

I rocked a hoe named Tina from the heart of Medina

Hey yo kid don't fuck with her!

Yea that girl Kit Kat she got the good poodle cat

Hey yo nigga you better fuck with her!",The Grain,2000

Blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect you red pro
Son trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycling
Pick up the brew thought I was Michael an'
Mics are writin' pool, now, I'm into Iron Duals
Turn-ons the Earth's whoopee, she out of law school
In hale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell night, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand, kids the old rumor is
blacks become immune to shit, we never did like
eati' dead birds chose the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the herbs pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter
Livin' off land you god damn right I fuck fans king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stocks with Bill Gates now

When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh and just giggle
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm sayin'

Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in the grass it's spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless rolls, lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes firey red, feet made of brass
Twelve men, following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smash the big boy totalled it, will shot fear effects
Son beamin' wifee on the beach, sippin' Zima
Wu 'binos, to latinos, we bust Selena
Over night, God schedules, fed ex
Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot, to handle one thought scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack em, say when
He rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts

Chop the O, sprinkle a little snow inside a Optimo
Swing the John McEnroe, rap rock'n'roll
Tidy Bowl, gun hold pro, Starsky with the gumsole
Hit the rum slow, parole kids, live Rapunzel
But Ton' Stizzy really high, the vivid laser eye guy
Jump in the Harley ride, Clarks I freak a lemon pie
I'm bout it, bout it - Lord forgive me, Ms. Sally shouted
Tracey got shot in the face, my house was overcrowded
You fake cats done heard it first
On how I shitted on your turf that time

Check out the rap kingpin, summertime fine jewelry dripping
Face in the box, I seen your ear twitching
As soon as I drove off, Cap' came to me with three sawed-offs
Give one to Rae', let's season they broth
Lightning rod fever heaters, knock-kneeder Sheeba for hiva
Diva got rocked from the receiver bleeder
Portfolio, looking fancy in the pantry

Perfected find truth within self, let's smoke
All hail to my hands, 50 thou' appraisal
Dirty nose with the nasal drip, click flipped on fam
Dancing with Blanche and them bitches, flicking goose pictures
Kick down the ace of spades, snatch Jack riches
Olsive compulsive lies flyers with my name on it
Dick made the cover now count, how many veins on it
Scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap
Ten years working for me, you wanna tap shit?
Bong bong bong! Your bell went rung rung rung!
Staple-Land's where the ambulance don't come

Yeah, you see what I mean?
You see what I mean, you motherfucking crybabies?
Get in line punk! You should be studying your arts
Instead of studying me
That's how you lost your first job punk
Now get in line, before you get your lil' thick ass tossed up!
Shit! I studied under Bruce Lee nigga
He was on the fourth, I was on the third

Pass me a honey-dipped spliff, black mental cause continental drift
One whiff of Pow U gets my Divine stiff
Brick rock, late night, hear the tick tock of my clock
I used to run up and pick, a crab lock
Hit his stash, dip back, to the Lab, make him flip
Uptown, BOO-DOOP, now we back on your ass
Incognito, fatal aikido blow, pop a needle
Dick a knock-knee ho, bust out her fetal
Nine inch long strong, Bobby pop the bitch thongs
Spit on her, then I bang on my chest like Kong King
Merciless Ming, point the killer bee sting
Ring dings, right through your head bing
Snap the wing off of bats, my battle-axe tongue hacks tracks
Once the ball drop, I'mma snatch ten jacks
Pass the crack to a niggarette, puff a loose leaf cigarette
While your man search the internet for Bob Digitech in Stereo
Crazy as Shapiro
Multiply myself ten times standing next to zero
And snap my fingers like the Fonz
And bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde
Dip hair, make a nigga flip in his chair
Had the armpit shaved off perfect with the Nair
Stomach flat as a pancake for her man's sake
Used to fuck her when she menstruate, but it made her hyperventilate

A-yo, we at the weedgate, waiting for Jake
We want eight ravioli bags, two thirsty villians yelling bellyaches
Heavyweight rhyme writers, hitting the grass that's the ripest
Pull out this kite from this white bitch
Talking 'bout, ""Dear Ghost, you the only nigga I know
Like when the cops come, you never hide your toast""
Guest starred in mad shit, CBL, Ice Water metallic
Past tense placed in gold caskets
Dru Hill bitches, specialist lounging at the mosque
Suede kufi wrap, undercover dentist
Rhymes is made of garlic, never in the target when the NARCs hit
Rumor is you might start to spit
You nice Lord, sweet daddy Grace, wind lifted
On the dancefloor, makeover's free followed by gauze
Duncan Hines monument cakes, we never half-baked
Alaskan, sexcapade, push your new court dates
Trauma, hands is like candy canes, lay my balls on ice
The branches in my weed be the vein
Swimsuit issue, darts sent truly from the heart, boo, I miss you
See daddy rock a wristful
Modern slave God, graveyard spells, fog your goggles
Laying like needles in the hospital
Five steps to conquer, ask Bernadette, big ass whistle
Ziploc your ear, hear thistle

To my real bitches take your drawers off
To all my high niggas, snatch her skirt off
Just in case she wanna play, get up in that bitch face
And tell her Ghost said, ""Take your clothes off!""

A-yo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies
Fifty cent sodas in the hood, they going crazy
Dead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts
Fast from the hog y'all and grow up

A-yo, crash through, break the glass, Tony with the goalie mask
That's the pass, heavy ice Roley laying on the dash
Love the grass, cauliflower hurting when I dumped the trash
Sour mash served in every glass up at the Wally Bash
Sunsplash, autograph blessing with your name slashed
Backdraft, four-pounders screaming with the pearly ash
Children fix the contrast as the sound clashes
Mrs. Dash, sprinkle with her icicle eyelash
Ask Cappa Pendergrass for backstage passes
Special guest, no more Johnny Blaze, Johnny Mathis
Acrobat, run up on that Love Jones actress
Distract the cat while I'm high sugar get a crack at this
Dicking down Oprah, jumprope, David Dinkins
Watch the black mayor of DC hit the mocha
Tangerine sofa, two super soakers in the Rover
Hit the sport's bar, tell a young lady to bend over
Meditated yoga, Paddle Ball, dancing with the vulture
Castor Troy laying for Travolta
Yo, switch the lingo, five-nine-seventy
God glow, seven fifteen four be ebony

Tap the glass, stop fronting Duke, fresh pair of jeans
Look I got loot, eleven in the Bass boots
Heard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me 5 pictures
One had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs
You asked the wrong guy son

Flew in two days ago to see his fam'

Wisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley
Hold up snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not trunk today, still looking fly, still slammed up hung

Starks fixed your face, copped out the 6, five years probat'
You dealing with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watching you
Make me want to lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwing me down, grab my gun
Go 'head bust me, heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray

Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all

Got big boy toys, push Sixes

Shatter your soul like glass windows

Ghostface Killah,"Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boom bum
She had a ass like Deborah Cox, face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
And times she got my ding-a-ling hard
When she said push hard, she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rockin' wallows
Drawin' crads, sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goines
Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins
Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss
Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bunched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke
Girl's so pretty, kids with little niddys
Hope the years go slow, slow
Surrounded by intelligence, life through education
Healthy minds will grow, grow
Catch me on a bus-stop, Dustin, cursin' out
The cops are still coming, vibe with me
Everybody's talking about Wu-Tang fronting
But you still telling lies to me

Beautiful in light shows, having no intentions on love
But having strung eyes of oppose, here we go
It's not the way she bubbed the gum, shooked her ass
I'm not the one, double dus, waiting for the bus
The faggot Nore son, now year later
Lady 7th floor, building 7-80
Fancy fox, booties for her socks, nothing else can change me
Young Nefertiti, knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree, she's a Capricorn
I really liked the girl, had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got (""powered"")
But hating, was Shinene and Grace and Key-lolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit
Eh yo, the bitches started swinging and shit
So I jumped in
Those were the days, made faces in school plays
Paper trays, city wide test, made half a days
Shooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga, I'll pop her cherry for her
Fresh air fun, here's dunn, alphabets, berets
Jellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings
Eh yo, I hit that shit, got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broked her chicko's sticks

Guys and girls, y'all remember those days, and shit
Girls walk around in school, one ponytail with the beret
Next looking like baby powder, you know what I mean?
Those were the days right there
Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy
you know what I mean? You'd just come in school for half days, and all that
Just to see that little girl right there, ? to this
Go home and think about it, you know what I mean?
May hump the bed sometimes on her, you know what I mean?
Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G
That shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom, you know what I mean?
Might get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, you know what I mean?
Word, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something, you know what I mean?
A little butter crunch joints or something, you know what I mean?
That's that real shit, G I miss those shits, man
I want to go back to school, man

The smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle toe Jeckle at min,
They took my medicade card, he's a good friend
Bugs still sniffin', Daffy Duck snitchin'
And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons
Bet you ""my golly, oh glory"" with a story to tell

His name is Abdrul, Colorful, Snow White tattoo

And the cat too, old girl who's clackin' her shoes
And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at school
It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs in Jellystone Park

Big Boy bustin' out his corderoy fix
Eleven, way beyond is little boy fit
Magoo, he gon' catch him at the teachers' conference
So later that week durin' open school night
Everybody there, saw open school fight
Blows is big, Olive Oil was pissed
The wolf was too, they murdered one of the pigs

He replied, ""Fuck my gun I'll eat you fast""
He said, ""What great big teeth you have""
""Mothafu, you better look at all the beef you have""

It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous

What I do, duck!

Son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like Santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap

Yo, what the fuck happened?

It was a set up to get wet up

Starks your bleeding

Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain

Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch

Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices

Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed

Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me,
What you want sweaty, Lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut

We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on
By then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah
Sent the kite through the Pens
Him and big Dan
Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots
Halls is quiet

Watch you break your all, big sixes 'cause I'm a nigga who don't like to fall
High roller, see how my dice kiss
Push you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice bitch
I rocks, believe it or not
Come broke to a dice game, step off and leave with a knot
Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot
What's in the pop? A hunnid G's to the bank to the man, who got it stopped
My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked
Four, five, six your heart drop, way deep in your socks
You wanna walk, broke your ass down the street with a bop
The drinks is on you tonight, from my peeps in the spot

Just like a fresh pair of Royals on the first day of school
It was love, even from the jump I spoiled you
Before the fame camera cars and the glitter
Though my occupation is tasty for God's sake it came with the bitches
But that's on another note (uh-huh) let me explain here
Right now sugar on how I feel for you
Like when we ugh yo I get these crazy chills from you
And when we done, yo I know the perfect meal for you
The mashed joints, big onions on sauteed fish
Little Royal, candle and one big kiss
You my pumpkin and my 'nilla custard, you cussed me out
When you found condoms laying in my pocket I was busted
I gets right with you (uh) form a life with you (yeah)
The type after sex get a warm rag and then wipe you
Hyped up love light it up, might bite you at the altar
I'm biting off you, I'm wearing white too

Ain't it funny how tables turn, chase you all around
Change your life baby, cause I love you baby

Said that it will ne-ver last

And I'm here, that's my word
Only fight you when we makin love, that's what I call it
Burnin the chronic we laughing while I'm shitting on the toilet
Camcord it, happy times record it, the time you asked me
For them blue Nike's, I was like, ""Boo I can't afford it""
I was fucked up, plus I was stuck, Starks the King
Hit the block and still scraped up, eighty beans
How you like them apples? My technique is Taye Diggs
Your attitude is right that's why I made you my Wiz
The only girl that can make my shit jump, with the slightest touch
You at the stove while I'm grabbin my stuff
God forbid something happen to us
Let's remain and friends and discuss our troubles and might try again
Word to my Iron pen, it's not good to hold the crying in
I feel the same way your heart's trapped in the lion's den
Iron Man, I am him
It's the beauty in our souls through Allah where the love lies within

Can't believe you found love in me, through everything

Every part of me, every thing I've done

In Pam's house there was money missing
She was too dumb, had her nose numb, sniffing blow in the kitchen
Her kids never ate, PCW involved with her
Kids that she never seen shipped through to Florida
Maxine dark skinned and bal' headed bitch mean
Pams right here together they're the coldest fiends
Ah! Shit! Guess who arrived at the door
It's Moony the supplier swung open the door
Bitch open the door, Maxine he goin' kill me
Chill I got a friend cop, girl you don't know it's beef
Three long kicks the hinges flew off

Back in the dollar bill he sniffed like six lines
He put his Gat down, why he do that?
Creeping through the crib is Maxine pot holdin' down with the grits
Pam sucking his dick, Maxine Al Greened him screaming slipped in piss
He ran into Ceas' room, grits down cryin' alright with his balls out
He stepped on Clarences' Biggie Smalls album
Mooney get that niggas, Pam yelling rip that niggas
Mooney went and got that dye out the kitchen
James jumped on Moon, poked him with a screw driver
Broke the TV Niggas watching Knight Rider

This is Pam Jerkins mother house the same shit go on in her brother house

You know Mooney is only a buck o'five wet
He only had two hundred dollars worth of shit
And the kids tore his ass up, the Ceas had a huddle up
I felt sorry for'm, the funny shit when bowlegged Keke hopped on 'im
Jumped on him pigeon toed Moony poured dye on him
You should've seen his motherfuckin' face fryin', half dyin'
They stuck a fork through his nuts
The little girl was happy she beat the brotha up
Quick pick the window up Mooney over heard
Right before they threw him out the Nigga said Word!

On the count of three he landed on the first floor balcony
Blood brains splashed, he was dead? and the cops never came

Hey yo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up
Children (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up
Got back off the road, heard you sleeping with fam
The whole hood ran up on me, I was like ""Damn!""
So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently
Arguments, face up in the air like you hating me
Ask you one question, was it good?
He have you on the wall like me, was it hood?
You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbing the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot
I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out
That night I cried with the kids, I was out
And my man, I'ma do him in
And the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him
And you can keep the crib, all I'm saying is,
let me find out you got men around my kids

Brushing off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him
I bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him
Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats
Heard ya water broke I was like ""Phewww"" and ran back
I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix
To find out that bird nigga tapping my shit
It's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough

Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy
Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me
The whole place was standin', G
What they chant, we was family
Jumped in the crowd and I swam to sea
Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me""

Dana Dane, front row bitches, I bang all three
Say, ""Yo, Meth, fuck it, throw a Jim Brownski
Versace, banana color robes and my socks be""
Them Billie Jean shits and they real Rocky
The fans can't knock me
I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me
Plus I'm cocky, bitch

Once I took off the hoodie, revealed the face
Cop patrol couldn't control the place
I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate
The signs up, yellin', ""We love your tape!""
I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make y'all wait
But good things take time to create
You can find me in your studio

Half baked, eatin' ganja cake
Tryin' to make my next release date
With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate
You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas
You love to hate GZA

I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victims, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief

The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans

Friday night, midnight, Atlantic City
Slot machines, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, when they ring off
Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
Cigars, paisley robes
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
That's the cause, just because
We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough
And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those lows
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
Special guest: Starks / Mark Ronson
First five hundred bitches went crazy he let them on and in
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

I can tell you what they say haters, if you want to know

When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies want to roll
Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe

My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug
Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love

When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud

I started buggin' out, fell in the zone, half the bone lit
Passed off, rubbin' on my ski hat, oh shit

Gleamin' little young fella, he just had the stupidest look, weeded

Yo, I'm tired and stressed, hungry and I'm vexed
And I'm flippin' 'cause these niggaz wanna play me for test
Shit fell off ya hand Lord? Stop it, I'm eyein niggaz in they faces
After that I'm goin' at niggaz pockets

Eye-ballin' every fake Frankie Lymon in the joint

Break out, find my shit
Yeah, yo now I got robbed, I smell it

Pah, with you and your dudes
If my shit come up, cool
Matter of fact, clack, clack, clack, clack
Niggas pulled out tools

Pass the illumin' Lord, tell the DJ yo, turn the fuckin' music off
We got announcements, we want y'all to listen clear
We just lost about mansion in here

And yo, eh yo, if we don't get it back it's gon' be a problem
Then my niggas gon' react and that'll be a problem
Eighty-five thou' gone we got a fuckin' problem
Ain't nobody leavin' alive until we find 'em

Excuse me, miss, no I ain't havin' it
I smacked him with the four pound, bitch hit the ground
Then I stepped off, dropped out the shit
Equipped with the dipped Courdouroy Bailey's with the cream stitch

Powerhouse biscuits that blow roofs off
Rae watch is missin', you take ya boots off and take off those chains
The fat fuck thought I was playin' so I started sprayin'
Chicks hit the floor, bottles broke

The owner slid through beefin', Duke threw the toast to his throat
We brought the noise like we here to promote
My man don't get his shit in four or five minutes
Yo we're leavin' with the vote

A gangsta's lotto, thirteen bodies and still climbin'
Big shotties, bodied when they sniff body
We did our thing too we got to the envy lobby
Our last four or five shots we see nobody

Yo, yo, yo, yo, turn the fuckin' lights off
Pass the illumin' Lord, tell the DJ yo, turn the fuckin' music off
We got announcements, we want y'all to listen clear
We just lost about mansion in here

And yo, eh yo, if we don't get it back it's gon' be a problem
Then my niggas gon' react and that'll be a problem
Eighty-five thou' gone we got a fuckin' problem
Ain't nobody leavin' alive until we find 'em

Eh yo, eh yo, shit got real that night
Power grabbed him, Vine smacked him dead in his head
(Oh shit, nigga he got a Magnum)
Yo we all holdin', rollin'

Grab a nigga, search him if he front, fuck it, blow him
Watchin' niggas foldin'
The bartender got a shotgun in his hand
Let off the wheelchair nigga got him and ran

Surround the don, full body armor automatically on
The faggots passed off the watch and gone
(Yo y'all niggas ain't searchin' shit)
Yo where the big mouth at? Niggas step up

Matter of fact nigga, line the fuck up
Nigga tried to swing on G's but he a gentleman
Son, he dropped the dead arm but failed to see it
Two shot G's pealed his meat

Let's see, niggas tried to front like my niggas is weak
Corey pulled the truck up, see-4ed this bitch, blew it the fuck up

Aiyo Clientele Kidd
Layin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who 8 hours get gig
Got rugby's on and 4/5ths
Attractin' them niggaz I go against, the money was his
One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars
I heard from the grapevine mine made it
Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet
The game is missin' somethin' unique
I put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep

CHEF! Ice Water, it was all in the timin'
CHEF! He gave y'all niggaz bricks on consignment
CHEF! To the death and he Billboard climbin'

Yeah uh
Yo Don Carta' bomb harder over nearly everybody
Very rarely you find me without the mini-shotti
Just waitin' for Rae to give met he cue and
You see about 100 Puerto Rican niggaz shootin'
Get down, lay down, we don't play around
I don't know what you heard but, we don't play around
It's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened?
How you leave the dope game to pursue rappin'?
Already knowin' that ya shit was trash
Breathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass
All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap
And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that
Uh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad
My niggaz set it when we get in the yard
Whether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock
Straight punch in ya lung and you niggaz gon' drop
What?

[Chorus x2]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo yo yo shoot him in his mouth.. (nah)
Fuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the act up
Bring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass
As lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah)
And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?
My murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls
Not even Ajax can clean that, Jack
We need that maintenace man shit that kill that greasy blood on contact
Finish you off 'cause I'm pressed for time
Your man and 'em will be next to die

This is Ghostface Bakery, ya'll ain't cake to me
Pushin' cocaine, Whitehorse in the city
Over Pun and Pac, I cried over Biggie
Spazzed out, grab a white bitch by her titties

Rock wallabies, this is Clarkology
You know copy Starky belong wit the triple technology
Quick wit the pistol, leave you cripple if you lyin', be
Tickle the butter soft nipples on the side of me

So muthafucka, let me slow that flow down
And bang an ol' mighty hammer like Joe Brown
Dust off rounds, surround sound, trey pound
Put a phat leather head to bed like night gowns

If ya'll wit me then build, shorty, brothers is real
We true dons, makin' glass on the cash is on
Get my head right and smash yours moms, kid
So chose me, the bitch greased my palms

I'm comin' from Paris city
I'm on the residence, so don't shit on me
Like cool G. rap I got the Ill Street Blues
You lose, you can rich them out of my shoes

Baby, me and my Crew, we comin' your way
Saian Supa do it everyday, all day everyday, all da
Don't fight, don't fight, just see the light, see the light
Wit the sound, RZA will make it all right

Grey Goose wit cranberry
The raspberry bikini on honey wit the black berry
Had my eyes bulgin', plus my pants bulgin'
Ready for indulgence, long stroke compulsions

I'm lookin' for devotion, slow motion
Tropical potions, Sun and body lotions
Sex on the ocean, nine inch explosions
Had me frozen like the icicle
Big legs like she ride bicycle

Shorty beefcake known to make my knees shake
Sweepstakes, first day at the cheesecake
Factory, Tony Starks in back of me
Sippin' on pina coladas, twistin' Daquiris
The gold lion is known to hold iron
Rings stuffed with diamonds, Bobby and Supa Saian

Saian, move it on your left
Saian, bring da muthafuckin' ruckus
See'est l'Saian, Saian, Saian, Supa

Et qu'ont do mal à tater l'esthétique
Je me dois de les rendre statiques
S-s see'est qui coq?

Quiconque qui veut jouer le coq
Je vaut mille Rocky au mic jusqu'à Milwaukee
J'lache do lest donc j'attends qu'on me lache de l'estime
Voici l'homme de l'est avec sa dream team
Tisse sa toile comme Lady Laystee autour des wistitis

Pas de mc de bas niveau, v'là do nouveau
Fout tout le reste dans le caniveau
Bousille pas ton cerveau car les ondes sont gravés
Et tu décale ta sono, abattez mes rivaux

Et t'as peur de rencontrer le reste do commando
Ensemble ou en solo
KLR nous unis, veille sur nous depuis là haut

J'débarque sur le projet, j'te baise ou j'grave
Écartes ton gros der, tes grosses fesses
Ramènes tes grosses lèvres, j'te le donne en conseil
Pas des grosses mères, des grosses maîtres

À l'aise poses ta grosse tête
Pas de proverbe mais ne cause
Pas trop prenne de gros projets
Pas la prochaine
Projètes de gros pièges dans les gros sieges

Protèges ton fausse air, sans faucettes j'te possède

While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there

As we stopped to stare at one another

Wish I would've bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side
We holding hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left my Wis' a thousand times maybe tonight though
Yo you sexy motherfucker, damn what's the recipe?
You make a nigga wanna god damn!

Ghostface Killah,"[Verse 1]
Yo, this for my niggas, though, special delivery
Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show why'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, 'cause I'm the commander
In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building place
Say vacate all women and children
I spit it out

[Chorus (repeat 2x)]
Special delivery
I want that
Special delivery
I need
Special delivery
Can I have that
Special delivery
Come give it to me

[Verse 2]
If you ain't ready, I'ma bust through ya curtain
Encore, you're not sure, I'm certain
Wait, make sure the mic workin'
Make cake, sorta like Earth Wind
And Fire, the rap vampire
Retire in the morn'
Warm like campfires
Matter of fact, I'm blazin'
Raisin' the roof up
Slide off with ya rooster
Took her to the stu and seduced her
Let her do a skit, then she hit my producer (Oh)
Not whatcha used to, I'm looser
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
The mystic ruler, grand imperial
Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo
MC's is dead and I'ma get head up at they burial
And that's disrespectful
I'm strong like Exo mixed with X, yo
And that's the high capability
And yes, I possess that ability
I spit it out

[Chorus (repeat 2x)]
[Verse 3]
Yeah, ayo, Dep so bright, light looking halogen
Spit that bar, car low mileagin'
Let's go, metropolitan
Area, 'cause I'm hearin' ya hollerin'
The earthquaker, Harlem bread maker
Gimme two hands, few grams and the shaker
Hit the block, watch the kids bake up
Your girl keep coming around
Then I'ma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious
MC's ran with this and that
But change your name to Saran 'cause it's a Wrap
Your rap is like a sedative
You sleepy, defeat me, negative
So it's over and I guess you gotta live with it
And you can tell by the records that's distributed
I spit it out

",Badman,2004
Ghostface Killah,"I play hard for nine innings dressed in fine linen
Cause pussy is the best next thing besides women
All the position I've been in couldn't explain how I'm living
My vision my intuition has risen
Here take a listen I'm hitting
Up to bat with precision
Sealing bags in the kitchen
Slinging crack to these pigeons
For the fact that I'm driven
My linebackers is missing
Send you back and good rides
Trapped in this mission where snakes and rats is forbidden
Keep my gun hidden niggas is bitches signing petitions
And they providing convictions
See I survive through the system under the livest conditions
My riders ride on a mission for snitching
You get your back blown right out of commission
You'll be missing like them crazy Christians and swimming with all the fishes
Your misses will come and visit your body with hugs and kisses
Now tell me is that nutritious we party with chips and liquors
Your wisses is coming with us for real kid they bought me presents
The difference is this is business big biscuits big figures
We click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious
Move cause the group is viscous
Shoot if you want your wishes to blow
See trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches

My design is already made
So young an so strong
And just waiting to be saved
My life's no longer in the hands of district attorneys or envious niggas
Who thirsty cause I'm OT with prince with thirty moving like magic
But niggas ain't worthy like Michael cooper when I shoot I aim sturdy
Mother maiden mother fuck em
Rhymes so dope I hope I make it through customs
We can take it to the streets like a game at the rucker
They claim they love us but all that changes
When you on and they fucked up dog ain't no flaws in a hustla
I ain't no longer in state greens and chuckers
Waiting for the beach port and the breaks streets oughta relate
I see it all in your face the window to your soul ain't tinted
You want to see me falling from grace
No way nigga I'm stretching my weight like cocaine dealers
What they gonna say now the flow way iller
If dough change things I'm no longer the same
But what I became does not conflict with from where I cam
I was dealing with caine like cold chilla back when lyricist rained
And dope was killing em, any MC who think they ill as me
Or real as me should chill I mean that's your opinion
But my raps is relentless like a mac with an infra
And I'm back with a vengeance, like Sprewell smashing the Knicks
After they shipped him despite the fans resistance
Big and 'Pac is up top so the nicest man living is right here
Its quite clear like diamonds that glisten",Tony/Montana,2004

Been around the world ladies come and go
Still I tell myself that you weren't one of those
That's what I get for being in your life
I'm not upset or ____ 

1- Tried to love you tried to please you
It never made a difference I see
Shoulda known betta
I feel so dumb
Made you the one
It never made a difference I see
Shoulda known betta

Such a perfect love or so I thought it was
But you were lovin' you, girl instead of lovin' us
That's what I get for being in your life
I'm not upset

2- Girl, I can't believe how much I really loved you
And I really don't believe how much I cared
So I guess I made a fool out of myself
But believe me, it won't happen again

[Ghostface Killah]
Your part of me son, yo let me jump in Case
We do the same shit girl watcha talkin' about dog
Stopped this young thief from eatin' pork
Now she on the phone hollerin', you want child support
Too bad I ain't got no cream and the kids they go and get it
'cause as soon as she get it, she go and spend it
And that's what I get just for lovin' her more
Got me feeling like a stranger when I walk in the door
Lookin' at me like it's my fault, (word)
With devious thoughts in the back of her head
Wishin' the kids were on morphine
Get laid off or get sprayed off lose my face
But I refuse like a plane I'm a take off
Induce my career now that I'm alone I
Think without stress for the moment Case

When I love I love too hard ____

Would roll on the street and on wit the feds

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds, clown.
Drown you like terrible weather.
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon.
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'.
To all - rise and shine; give God the glory.
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory,
And still got bills and employees to pay.
So excuse me, Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days.
My ways of control is hard to swallow.
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind.
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine.
Dis-play your indie, but say no more or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo.
To the dirt, and edit the clip and lost Kano.
My mens wear problems like Timbs.
See it all in they face; ask Mase, he got wars to win,
Scores to settle, crews to crush.
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile.
It's Long Isle y'all; longevity sustainin' my celebrity status.
From A-M to P-M, you see him on file, y'all.
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right.
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop,
Shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light.

""Oh, whaddya know?  He comes.""

Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls; here's my back, stiff, straight up.
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic.
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop.
Top drama every time these commas don't drop.
Pop spots like lint on your shirt; the net worth.
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball;
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six.
I circumcise the track; you just a dick, overlapped and hooded.
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John.
I repeat like yesterday; it don't stop.
George of this poor life, pop, put to Scarlet;
In a place she believes much better than your lies.
She say she lookin' better in my eyes; bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck.
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby.
I tried to speak my piece in court, but Judge Mills paused me.
Bifocusedly die, hopeless sometimes.
Yo, cry your poker face; you oughta try it one time.
When God is an non pos' you stand to download.
Demanded like slaves on trial; we want free.
Man, cock aim ready; it's time you MC.
So you rappers bust bibi guns; graffiti runs
Through my veins, since cable with the wired remote.

And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men.
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in.
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn.
Hula hoop all bitches; crew full with brand new Keds.
Cutmaster kill 'em; make sure we cut classics.
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets.
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the P-A,
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads, and snatch a dude's toupee.
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n A-J,
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed, like a glass of O-J.

Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, for your essence (your beautiful essence)
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubt or no fears
Or no questions

Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joy and hurt
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

At first you didn't mean that much to me
But now I know that you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you
And everything that I do I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true

Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray

Through all the ups and downs the joy and hurt

Hungriest shit, seventeen dummies a clip

My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy

Don't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dipping with that
Uh, down-shifting on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, running like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast

Blow niggas over 'turt, bitches, dimes and trays
Blow a nigga a jewel and watch him slide away

Splatter fagots in lobbies, the heat burn off his eyelashes
Don't try to pass this, back up or you'll receive something
Real tragic, them hollows'll race through your jacket
Semi gangstas with weak tactics
Forensic scientists called in to display graphics
For square inch to his back winds
They brain is spleen, it's left all over a fiend's mattress
Bastard, we cock and squeeze after we leave our ratchets
We keep the hood cryin' for massive havoc
No Trix we take from silly rabbits, yo feed them lead carrots
The little mans'll connect and they touch that fabric

How the fuck she get the codes, I don't know

Next thing, she laying in the hotel lobby, spotted me
Tipping the doorman, holding hands with my bitch besides me
My heart drop, everything stops, scared to death
Told my broad to keep it moving, cause I just got knocked
Don't turn around, as soon she did, she bust a shot
Plus she talk, security drop when she touch the glock
I had the gum-face on, long face on
Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone
There goes the car, house, rhyme boats or jewelry
Court date judges, my shorty tried to screw me

Hey! Hey!

Yo!She didn't pick up
Guess she was gettin her clit eat up

No mind I just finished diggin her out
Wit my boxers on and I had my joint in her mouth
Gaggin er an shit lookin down at the bitch laughing
I""m bout to smash that pussy like baby asprins
I""m fuckin her
Like I had feelings for da bitch
I caught feeling for da bitch
Fuck if Pretty Tone's whipped!
If I wasn't whipped why I keep giving up my dick?
Like its voodo on da kid
I keep suckin on her clit
From the bed to the bathroom
Toney diggin her down
Sweatin bullets like we in the ring going some rounds
Miss Lucy, eatin sushi playin wit her coochie
On some Lil Kim shit tattooed right up on her booty
That said
""Beat you five beans you can't even move me!""
Know how to work her pussy muscles when yo dick is in that cootie
That's right
Yeah her nookie's the bomb
She had niggas wrapped around her middle finger like the female Fonz
But any way you wan..I'm call her again

If she diss me I'ma fuck up her Benz

(Background sample)
Hello?(woman)
Hey!(man)
Hello?(woman)
Hey women! This is the second time I called you!

Not rushing into love with anyone

(Chorus)
Last night changed it all

Phone rings

[Outro: girl (Ghostface Killah) and Theodore Unit]

",Last Night (Skit),2004
Ghostface Killah,"You got it (baby)
You got it (uh-huh)

Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from Shaolin
Stood by my side when my world was caved in
She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy
Every time she told me she loved me, I said ""no"" back
Since I was fucked up in the game, migraines
No honey in pockets, all I had was the change
Forty-five feelings, they got the beef
I through the heat to my dome
She said ""If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone""
Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong
Our bond is even more stronger when the night is gone
Say, ""Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water running
Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven""
And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion
And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em
Whose asking, your still has come
Stay focused, keep it cool, you know I love you
Love you too, babe, thank you

(you out there) you got it (louder)

The more I drowned, the more down he went
As if to say, them other chicks wasn't meant
When she came through, by every square inch possible
Help the kid get on out, every obstacle
Long talks at night, arguments and still try'nna solve
Whether who is right, we mad tight
And the way she, never call the cops on a nigga
Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body
My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop
Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot
Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure
Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more
Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie
Look you dead in the eye
Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest
I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas

You got it
I was down in the sea of love
Going down to a clear cloud
You came and saved me dear (saved me) (Ghostface!)
It's too bad you didn't do it, I ain't never been used to it
The way we stopped them, dear (stopped them dear)

To all the ladies who love they man
Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in
Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em
Out of love, doing juks for them
To all my ladies who love a girl with good brains on 'em
Baggin' to get your name tattooed on 'em
Kiss 'em in the morning, hold 'em, definitely show 'em
We got our crab down, packed when it's time to mold 'em

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh,
(you out there) you got it (louder)
I was down, thank you",Save Me Dear,2004
Ghostface Killah,"""Take me back, take me back, take me back."" [Repeats]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, hey yo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back
After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back
That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like
""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back
That could never happen, I'm sorry
No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny
Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks
Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight
And when you told me your Merlo, need more grapes
I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!""
And if you did, that's not how you act at all
And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Jacki-O)]
Please, babe, I love you
(Take me back, I'll never do it again)
Always want you
(You know that you my lover and my best friend)
Yes, darling, it's true
(Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on)
Please, babe, I want you

[Jacki-O]
Back to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you
Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you
When three was a crowd, but I dealt with it
And your sex wasn't wild, but I dealt with it
I always felt shitted, you should of take me back
The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks
I got you in South connects, for the hard grind
That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time
You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things
And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings
I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do
I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two
I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two
Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on
Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog
Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O
Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat
What you actin' for? Get back in the door
Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you
Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume
Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle
Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals
We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal
The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you
Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you
Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you
Fiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you
Take me please, take me with ease
Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees
'Member the first time you made my key
You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd
I miss shit like that, and all of the times
We played cops, I'll arrest you in bed
Police brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red
God damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed
Fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo this goes for everybody all across the world
Whether you got fired or your lover dropped you and all that
You know what I'm sayin'? Everybody want to get tooken back
You know what I mean? Don't be afraid to ask, if you want to see,
Yo, take me back, fuck it, everybody want to get tooken back and shit
This is your man, Big Ghost, your host, signing off and shit
Theodore, I understand",Tooken Back,2004
Ghostface Killah,"Oh, this that fire! Ghostface and Missy

Somebody tell that girl that her ass too big
I give it to her right and she let me live
Can't eat that, 'cause there's no relationship
I beat that, the next day you called in sick
Frontin', not for nothin', I pop buttons off
Baby Phat, Levi's, J.Lo's, Guess and Gap
'Cause it's like that, young lady, bet I make you shake
Like the Puffy and Jay-Z's, Dre's and J.D.'s
Come on, if not you, I'ma beat this song
But if you were 'bout our business, wouldn't be here this long
Let me break it down for you, all I wanted to know
If I could just feel it and touch it, and break it down into numbers and
Come with me and just leave your friends
'Cause we don't need no cock blocking
Tellin' you this without no option
Tell your friends ""Peace, look, I'm bouncin'""

Tush, tush, tush
Want to slide in the bush, bush, bush?

Ooh, gosh, you a nasty girl, sassy
Picture me layin' you inside my classic pearls
Toes'll curl, giddy up, you go girl
I'm about to, uh, do it slow girl
Ooh, you in control, it's in your world
She on, I think I like ol' girl
Take it out, turn around
Charlie horse, shit, threw me off balance
Wildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent
To let you know on how I rep in Staten Island
This is the reason I came to you
So we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do
'Cause we don't need no representation
Domination, got them waitin' patient

Now this is the way y'all suppose to
To get down, y'all ain't right
Somebody say ""Aha! Ghost is back!""

Pull back the curtain, let me work your sermon
Playboy don't hurt me like a virgin
You seem real determined to put a hurtin'
But if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin'
You got a lot of nerve, to want to serve my curves
My 36D, 36 hips
The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles
And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips
Eh, I really like you baby
Do you know how to wife this lady?
Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch
Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush
Now shush, in my bush
And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh
Just throw it, I'll show you how to push
Kinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist
Come on

Tush, tush, tush
Wanna slide in the bush, bush, bush?
(I'm on top, you like push, push, push
Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You wanna get up in my tush, tush, tush?
You could slide in the bush, bush, bush
(I'm on top, you like push, push, push
Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You wanna get up in that tush, tush, tush?
Wanna slide in my bush, bush, bush

Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood

Ghostface Killah,"Head on straight, mask on crooked
Exit stage left with the cash, gone took it
Off like a koufi, the fit was a bit doofy
He tried to get screwy, with that ""two for you,
One, two for me, G,"" cut the cranky attitude
Wet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude
Whether you's a rapper or dang sanger
Once you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger
With a new crew keychain and street name
What set do he claim for fame, peep game
Just to keep feta and stay dip
You need it like a letter or better a getaway whip
This old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted
Plan to end global starvation and fat her
Now what in tarnation did I go and do that fer?
Stuff happens, like gettin' snuffed for tough tit rappin'
See, I told 'em enough, quit yer yappin'
The same applied to any and all chumps
The only question he had for y'all is how many lumps?
Three or four? either or? mon cheri amour
See, why you need your heater for?
The super villain slid in your party for free
Warn a emcee, get outta here kid, you bother me!

The day I took my mask off my face was missin' for two days
For the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity
Tony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery
Who is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats
Oh no! the fans cry for the mask back on
Told 'em ""Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn""
Few years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived
He'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron
The other half water look like alien science
In the summertime, you can see the face boil
But the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil
Mad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?)
I get stuck 'cause my brain all numb
Like I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's
Aquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly
I seen his feet and they both lefty, he's steppin' half correctly

Ghostface Killah,"See here's the thing

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no

Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are

I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travee and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me

The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
'Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through

And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl

And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no

Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up

Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to ""did he really just say that shit?""

Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going up for keeping my phone on vibrate

To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you

It's not a skam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucka for smucka's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun

Shut up and kiss me like the antedotes under my tongue
Whoa

We have to take our clothes off
And we have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time

Oh no
We have to take our clothes off
And we have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time

I need y'all niggas to buckle up one time
Fasten your seatbelts, I'm a take y'all on some real shit
This Theodore shit, y'all niggas know what time it is and shit
Y'nah mean? It's real motherfuckin' shit, you know

Yo, making moves back and forth uptown
60 dollars plus toll is the cab fee
Wintertime bubble goose, goose, clouds of smoke
Music blastin' and the Arab V blunted
Whip smelling like fish from 125th
Throwin' ketchup on my fries, hitting baseball spliffs
Back seat with my leg all stiff
Push the fuckin' seat up, tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks
Rocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips
I'm ready for war, got to call the Cuban guys
Got the Montana pulled in front of the store
Made my usual gun check, safety off, come on Frank
The moment is here, take your fuckin' hood off and tell the driver to stay put
Fuck them niggas on the block they shook, most of them won't look
They frontin', they no crooks and fuck up they own juks
Look out for Jackson 5-0 cause they on foot
Straight ahead is the doorway, see that lady that lady with the shopping cart
She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway
Damn she look pretty old Ghost, she work for Kevin, she 'bout seventy seven
She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding
Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in
3 o'clock, watch the kids, third floor, last door
You look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you
Why? Why you behind me leery?
Shakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you
You is a crazy motherfucker, small Hoodie dude
Hilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit
Straight parry shit, Krispy Kreme, cocaine, dead bodies, jail time you gon' carry it
Matter of fact, all the cash, I'm a carry it
Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott
This is the spot, yo son your burner cocked?
These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son
Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice
Big round onions on a T-bone steak, my stomach growling yo I want some
Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knocked at the door
Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face
Push me in quickly when the bitch open up
Remember you don't me, blast him if he reach for his gun
Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie
No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you suppose to phone me
Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door
The door flew open, dude had his mouth open
Frozen, stood still with his heat bulgin'
Told him Freeze! lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment
Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, axed him
Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get the smoke and you fast
His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon
Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot, then kicking the four fifth
Broke a bone in her wrist and she dropped the heat
Give up the coke! But the bitch wouldn't listen
I'm on the floor like holy shit! Watching my man Frank get busy
He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz
He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'
Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared
Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air
Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear
Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first
Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon
The coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad moves
The big one had the centipede stab wound
Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out
The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out

Over for some red wine, nice Barry White

She pulled out a cigarette, hon', here's a lighter
Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink
Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek
When she spoke her smoke floated when it left her throat
Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word
I was infatuated

She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it
Plus the bottle was nickel plated
It make a young girl steez, yo, feel outdated
And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybeline
Cover Girl lipstick, plump color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-five-six, shit

The ashes was hangin' off her stog' so she flicked it

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo

Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)

Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin through, hourly

Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me'

But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song

Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

Ghostface Killah,"Every girl that's guilty of waiting so long sometime...
So it seems like it doesn't make sense...

[Female singing with laughing in the background]

[sniffing]
Yea, it was them cute pretty bitches that was smelling like coke
They kept going [egh egh] like they had shit in they throats
They had stacks on the tables, cables
I had to say it was like early May a few days 'til my birthday date, baby date
I'll play to the sucker DJ, lookin' like Enrique
Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente
He said just gave a nod with a thumbs up wink
I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink
Bartenders know me big spenders, gave us those monster drinks
Sent us ? and cigars that stink
Playing them oldie but goodie classics, them honies had fat asses
Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses
Toney with the Montana, I came to play
With my long fingernail, yo honey you should pass that yay
Let me see what color you got boo, I got that beige
I see y'all from the perihperals? ladies far right from the stage
I'm thirty-three, I look twenty-six with big furs on
What y'all inherent the Santa Maria? y'all money that long?
Your father must have fell back when y'all started fucking
You asked me what I think about dude? I say fuck him
And this one bitch called me Fat Albert
The way my pockets had the mumps you know that Ghost is 'bout it
Then I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets
They said fuck you, took a sniff and then they didn't tell me
Just because you left home, this is Tone...Yo you see I flip stones
Birthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned
Peerage pretty young ladies lost at six, Gucci kicks
And they picky when it come to they dick
If y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well
Free tales, sweet smells, slee? well hear bells
Before you sleep read your books like it was mah fanmail
And when you wake ? you woman the whole world can tell
Word life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop
College girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop
And all I ask in life's for you to be careful
Stay focused, take care of your health
Have kids and marry a prince
Good luck and happiness
And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow
The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow
And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library
You got the right conversation, education, and looks
With the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks
Baby get on your feet, be an acocuntant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid
Computer wizard, you about to get paid...

[Outro, over background singing]

Yea...
You know I just met y'all
And I love y'all already and all that
But I gotta get off that nose candy
To make it in life and all that shit...
That's why I'm here
I'm like a father figure and all that shit
I let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but...
YaknawhaI'msayin?
'cause I drop jewels all over the place
Y'all too pretty for that...
Some of y'all nose hairs is burnt
I just want you to snap out of it
You know why...cause youse a...

This guy is a bulldozer with a wrecking ball attached
He'll leave a ring around your eye and tread marks on your back
He's an animal
He's hungry
You ain't been hungry, since ""Supreme Clientele""
Remember what you first told me when I took ya in
You wanted to be a fighter (Yeah!)
You wanted to be a killer (New York Stand Up)
You wanted to be the Champ! (Got your boy in the booth nigga)
You ain't hungry
Matter of fact I don't want you in my gym
Get out of my ring, you disgust me

[Ghostface Killah]
Godzilla bankroll
Stones from Stilion
Yo I ain't got it all, that means I barely home
Trailblazer stay ballin
Revenge is my arts is crafty darts
While y'all stuck on Laffy Taffy
Wonderin' how y'all niggaz get past me
I been doin this before Nas dropped the Nasty
My wallos I did 'em up
Them bricks I send 'em up
My raps y'all bit 'em up
For that now stick 'em up
Ten Four good buddy Tone got is money up
Worth millions still back your bitch lookin bummy what
Ya'll staring at the angel of death
Liar liar pants on fire You burning up like David Koresh
This is architect music
Verbal street opera pop a 'tec man fully got the projects booming indeed
I ran through the tunnel
Terrorize speed
That's when I was still in the jungle slangin that D

Get out my face! No you ain't got no mo?'.
Don't need no has been messin' up my corner

You should have never came back
Look here man after I crucify him, you next!
And you better have a good doctor to rearrange your face
I'm the Champ!

[Ghostface Killah]
Who want to battle the Don?
I'm James Bond in the Octagon with two razors
Bet cha'all didn't know I had a fake arm
I lost it, wild and raw before rap, I was gettin' it on
Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs
My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on
Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo
Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging
Frauds is leftin they draws on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga resemble Keenon Ivory Waynes
Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow box for training ?
Ya'll still eatin bacon

[Spoken over the beat]
Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death
I told y'all I wasn't going away
You had your shot no give me mine
Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man
You think you going to keep me down
They don't want me to have the title
Because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there
Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed
I'm the Champ!

[Ghostface Killah]
I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil on my left ankle
Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch that means I'll fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jaeger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to it tis ? spark when weed went up
The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants
And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it
They head and they earl to the toilet and vomit
Back East summer MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme
Proof and you double deuce in the jeans
My man ? was on the floor with the mother load both of them green
IBF WBC Cruiserweight title shots and Rap belts belong to D.C.

[Spoken over the beat]
Listen I am bad, I said I am bad
I'm a bad man
I'm so bad sometimes I's scare myself
Sometimes I look in the mirror and want to kiss myself I'm so pretty
Now who am I (The Man!)

Ghostface Killah,"Ah-yo
Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Ah-yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong

Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know

She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks b****in
But Dawn quit to bust a b**** a** and s***
See she did 12 months over a ratchet

Not no crab s***
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab s***
Clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it

It was cla**ic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat

Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin gla** bowls in her cat clothes
'Cause crazy stacks

Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box

She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode

Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Ah-yo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes

That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on

On some marvin gay s*** like lets get it onnnnn
Sugar
Let's get it on
Ah-yo she a diamond in the rough

Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
F*** cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me

I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky

She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side

Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting

Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples

Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete a** nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone

It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

[Trife]
Ah-yo, ah-yo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
A** off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up

Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
'Cause she my b****, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that a** like Ciara on the top of that whip

Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...

So I keep swimmin', amazed that I'm not drownin'
Butterflies took control when I arrived
I opened the door, no, I knocked first

I'm not on my turf, I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks
Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashin' they tail
Like follow me, now, don't be afraid

I'ma show you where all the jinns and spirits pray
If you scared to face this life, you shouldn't stay
So, I kept on swimmin', grabbed on to her fin to help me out

As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out
Then she asked me politely what I'm thinkin' about
I said nuttin', she said nuttin' leaves nuttin'
If you fill me up, bet this'll bring that out

I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus
Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook
Pearls on the mermaid girls
Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world

Up ahead lies Noah's Ark but that's waves away
And way to the right, that's one of our bangin' spas
She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe
Bangin' the Isleys, he slow backed up

Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein' me hard
He got vexed and smacked his boo
Took off, continued my travels, seen a rock from the Titanic
Lookin' fat and, nah, it wasn't damaged

Then I seen somethin' real big, sky blue and gold
With white walls, behind a large city
That was lost before Christ walked the walk
Upon the waters that's so bright

Every time we got close the mermaid held on tight
All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
Bismillah are-Rahman, are-Raheem?, Allah screamed
That we heard from afar

Everyone salat and the world's banginest mosque got crowded in
With life that I can't explain
They said sir, yes, I'm glad you came
Greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs
Prayed after that we said, ?Amen?

The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin in the living room
Everybody had cups stylistic song boom
But then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up
Baby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up
I'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good the joke's on me
I heard a voice ""get in the room, I get angry""
Sting my feet catch a tantrum
Spit, scream, fuck that
Momma shake me real hard, then get the big gat
That's called the belt help me as I yelled

Get beat, then I'd run and tell grandman ""mama hit me for no reason""
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin
And felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds
In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ahHH!)
Nowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a ceas
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
And bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash
That's back to back beatings

Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like Tabasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infatuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's goin' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health

Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

Trying to make some quick cash for a hit of that stash

For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on

[Chorus: Eamon]
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah

I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'ma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me

[Chorus]

But I'ma try to, hold on, and be strong
Cause this time, you're so wrong
But I wait, and, I long
For you touch, but you're gone

Ant boogie, what up? Uh-huh

In the crib, with my wiz, getting my grown man on
Listening to classic soul, with the slow jams on
Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears
Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town
I seen niggas die off, like dandelions in the fall
Niggas heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall
Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball
It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall
Cause we living in denial, but these lessons are vital
When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival
Now everybody wants to be next American idol
But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green, knahImean?
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green

I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
But I ain't been to many operas
Or had money for private doctors
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown

I know the ledge, and I ain't planning to drown
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown

Momma ain't raised no fool, they say we gotta save the children
But first, we gotta save our spoons
I was taught not to waste my food
Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed
Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet
Used to get teased by my friends, cause I had bigger feet
I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile
Cause as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad
Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga
From putting that coke in them bags
That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash
Got jealous niggas hating, big time, hoping I crash
I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em
Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em
That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey
Ask niggas how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony

[Chorus]

Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process
I learned that slow progress, is better than none
That's why I'm still here pursuing my goals, baking that bread
In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows
I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew
And show niggas a good time, by getting drunk in the stud'
Some niggas find happiness, with a blunt and a brew
They talented niggas, but they just need something to do
It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks
We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick
Tryina' survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC
And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix
He could of been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmit
Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis
That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis
Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business

Listen, man, it's going on 2007, g

(New Year, let's give it up) How your 2006 was son?
(Go and get up, get up, ya'll niggaz is crazy
Ya'll know how I get, my 2006 off, nigga I broke two of my toes, nigga
It's going down nigga, that's what's up, ya'll niggaz is crazy)
That's why you came to the show with, um, peanut butter on your toes, that day
(Nigga, why you gotta bring everything up? Man, everybody here enjoying)
Nah, son, because your shit's --- (crazy, a happy New Year
This muthfucka) Nah, boy, yo (no, man...) But your shit was looking mad timid
That was the funniest shit in the book, that day (Find out who...)
That's your toes right there! (Who the fuck said I broke 'em)
Yo, how you put them little baby cast on there? (Just a little punk ass nigga man)
How you put them in the baby cast like that, though, son?
Come on, son, that's what I was, that shit, yo
Let me tell you something, I ain't gon' front, yo

Fuck that, let's get this paper!

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo I was sitting at the table thinking
How the hell do I murder these M.C.'s, sting 'em like bees
My attitude's that of Hannibal, not compatible
Why I would damage you, fuck, if I drink, then ran with you
Ya'll chose to war, so called rich niggaz wanna verse the poor
I'll rob you first, then go to your earth, it's not gon' hurt
If you try calling the cops, it's not gon' work
All you gotta do is lay in the dirt, we dug a hole
And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert
With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan
With rhymes, and ya'll can't believe it's not butter
I told ya'll to chill, stretch all out like franks on the grill
With a classic deal, I'm like a farmer when I'm playing the field
Just painting my seeds, in 20-06, it's time to build

""Ghost is back..."" - [sample 4X]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I cooked up the beef, seasoned up the meat
Fried 'em, tried 'em, took it out the grease
Ghost came to steal the show, since you loving your broad
I'ma lay back and reveal your hoe
She a brain therapist, chick you can't kiss
Opened up her legs, like ""ooh, I smell fish""
Yeast infection, queen, she love dick
Shivlered up tits, she'll bang the whole Knicks
Now how can I salute you, kid, I'm planning to do you
Crucial, blow rugers at who you with
We bump heads while we out in the street, it's all good
My trigger fingers'll matter, kick the back of your feet
And your red monkey jeans, is looking like a scene from Baghdad
That's bad, flags red, dirt beds
Ya'll niggaz is eating, crystal meth' heads
We pissed out, wrist out, with the best threads
Knockin' niggaz off, knockin' niggaz out
Fucking up rappers is what I'm about
I'm holding Staten Island down, ya'll cats must be dead
Keep fronting and lose your head

You can decide on who's liver
Toney Knight Rider, wisdoms love my saliva
Slobbin' 'em down, hoggin' the mound
Pitchin' 'em eightballs, robbing the town
Don't let your gangsta, get you murked up
Faggot ass homeys done got you worked up
Rappers can't come around, ya'll wide rap is dead
Freeze, nigga, come off the bread
Whole horizon, hit 'em with toast, a rap arising
Ringing the boys bell like Verizon
Eyes, looking surprised, that the four-five
Yo Ghost, don't even do it, I got some more pie

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Word up, aiyo I'd like to give a mean shout out to Staten Island
Holding the boy down, ya'll know what it do

Ghostface Killah,"Thirty thousand feet up in the air, up in the Leer
Dressed in a black tux, forty cal tucked, strapped in a chair
Half-asleep hoppin' out of my seat, caught in a daze
Turned around and saw a white man's face covered in shades
I must've passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out
Three more niggas approachin' holdin' they macs out
One spoke, gave me the keys to a boat, reached in his trenchcoat 
And pulled out a yellow envelope
Which contained twenty thousand in cash, 
A photograph of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache Miguel Sanchez, 
Keep a gun hidden in his pants' leg with armed bodyguards, 
Surveillance around his land spread
He runs a billion dollar organization under investigation, 
Plus he's wanted by immigration
Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement, 
How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents? 
They knew my background, knew about what happened out in Sac-town, 
They knew about the rap down South, they laid the facts down
Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel, 
Or spend the rest of my life in prison
A classified mission on some James Bond shit, 
007-style up against some straight convicts
Now I'm pondering, thoughts wandering, 
Got my girl on the phone, tell her to kiss little J, 
Cause I'll be gone again ""Honey I can't speak."" she suckin' her cheek, 
""If everything go good baby I'll be home in a week.""
Pinchin' myself just to see if I'm dreaming, 
Call up my team and meet me by the docks in Miami, 
I fly out this weekend

I got you nigga, 4-4 pop two niggas, 
That druglord that we want got a spot for niggas, 
And if we kill him, it's back to the block my nigga, he carry Rugers, 
34 shots I figure He only holla at the kid when there's money involved, 
They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all
But me and Trife doin' right together, 
Got no choice but give us ten, like we sellin' white together, 
Left side 4-5 right black Beretta, takin' trips overseas flippin packs for better, 
Every flight a hundred stacks and better so grind hard, get your money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds Fuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers and try drop charge, 
Hit the block hard It's kinda hard being G-O-D, 
If he owe Trife, he owe me, load up the mac rounds, 
M-I-A, call that the Jack-Town
Tell niggas I'm on my way, comin' back down, 
Miguel Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap now Theodore extortin' your shit, 
Handin' out packs now, I used to listen to 50 and jam Back Down, 
Now I sling 50 kilos where I'm at now, 50 a wop,

Ghostface Killah,"This is why the World Series of Poker
Is decided over a no limit poker tournament
Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game
They consider no limit the only pure game left

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same

Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked 'til someone said I had enough
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver

He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty G's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out

I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island
He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding
This son of **** all night, he set me up
He check, check, he trapped me

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

It was a cash game, 100 200 dollar table
Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able
July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out
It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt

Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs
I buy him for the ****, twenty G's, I'mma damage ya
Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted
I'mma put y'all all on tilt, give me a minute

So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards
Two four off two, y'all ain't no superstars
I should of been at the table, World Series of Poker
I'm up 80 G's already, y'all a bunch of jokers

Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in
With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in
Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street
A four hundred thousand dollar pot boy, life's sweet

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck

Think it's sweet, and try to creep or run up on us
They get deeper than twelve foot, and you be leaking out of order
Don't beef, if you ain't beefin' for no quarters
'cause pain is money, you float funny when you surfin' the water

I'm that dude slangin' pack by the border
I love my life, I live it twice, 'cause it's up to me sorta
You a fool with a mental disorder, and it's probably your daughter
That really love me, for the **** that I taught her

Will Smith on the guest list, pops is the king
I'm the fresh prince, forty oil tune, kick ya chest in
Us that got the universe confession, pardon your dame
I'm new to the game, but true to my lessons

Jeans, hoods, ****, ****

Visions of me swallowing ****, being chased by jake
And the sound of the razor keep hitting the plate
And tooters is flab with ****, with **** and them jeans
We chew through it, like we coming down off ****

And my P.O., she half Creole, I move from Philly to Dallas
With true talent, like my name is T.O.
So when I ****, I gotta **** slow, she know I kick them Vasine bottles
'cause if I'm dirty, I ain't letting it go

Your project steps is Ajax down, dry blood
Maintenance men with the scrub brush, scraping the ground
Diapers, baby rattles and broke lighters, I led many
Horses to water, just to see if they like it

Taste my, Betty Crock', ready rock, bet he cock, now
News flash, my **** ridin' L, laid a cop down
Any of ya **** want beef, I will stop clowns
I got a bad ox' fifth, now how the **** sound?

Jeans, hoods, guns ****

Aiyo, what up S.G.? Aiyo, what's poppin' my ****
I'm just oil in the ****, exercising my trigger
Finger, I've got the biggest ****, yeah, I got a crispy stainless
Your mans ain't **** those hoes, they just a bunch of gamers

Them head shots, neck shots, probably blow they brains in
I'm so close to the edge, pushin' they **** face in
I bet you now, them mutha**** really start complaining
No hesitation, my reputation'll leave 'em chaining

We go hard, like the NARC's when we start invading
I copped the license and registration, to cock and aiming
It's all entertainment and all my **** made it
We hard body like Wu-Tang and Iron Maiden

I keep the **** blazing, hands hurt
Like a **** when she putting braids in, I think it's so amazing
We ran **** for hours, up in the Days Inn
Hood rats and **** motels, we seen baking

You need to just walk away like Kelly Clarkson

And hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry and trying to bring that old thing back
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame
How you can't get me off the brain
He that lame
You love how I bring the pain
Got them rug burns stinging, and you saying my name
Say my name, uh
That's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne love; word up, we gonna toast

Yo, get to bath and bodyworks pumpin' the spice cream

Ghostface Killah,"This is why the World Series of Poker
Is decided over a no limit poker tournament
Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game
They consider no limit the only pure game left

[Chorus]
We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean poker face
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top
You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

[Shawn Wigs]
It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same
Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked til someone said ""I had enough""
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver
He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty g's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out
I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island
He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding

This son of bitch
All night, he set me up, he check, check, he trapped me!

[Chorus]

[Shawn Wigs]
It was a cash game, 100/200 dollar table
Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able
July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out
It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt
Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs
I buy him for the macks, twenty G's, I'ma damage ya
Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted
I'ma put y'all all on tilt, give me a minute
So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards
Two four off two, y'all ain't no superstars
I should of been at the table, World Series of Poker
I'm up 80 G's already, y'all a bunch of jokers
Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in
With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in
Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street
A four hundred thousand dollar pot boy, life's sweet

Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
Cause they shit is too fat like an Adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

(feat. Keyshia Cole)

[Intro: Ghostface Killah (Keyshia Cole)]
Damn, this is for all my women that's been going through the struggle
On welfare, living the rough life (oh I cried, but see I'm thankful)
It's gone be alright, that's right (Thankful for the trouble
For holding me down, every day, oh yeah..)
This is how we gone do it, I want you to explain your story
Then I'mah tell you mine, tell 'em
(Uh, can't ask for any more.. more...)
Tell 'em Keyshia..

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Momma, where did you go wrong
Because I need to know
You got me living the life you were living
When you were young...
And I'm heading down the same path, uh
But the difference between me and you
Is, oh, hey, hey, hey

[Ghostface Killah]
There's not a difference, boo, it's real life..

It's not ya momma fault, it's ya fathers fault
It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic
Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain
And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain
She Lost her first child in 74
And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw
She can't take it she constantly cryin fallin down on her knees
Like help me lord please I'm ready to leave
All she needed was somebody to rub her feet
Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets, come on

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
There's not a difference, boo, it's only an 8-figure, back me up

I been sent by an angel to snatch you up
Take you way above the clouds and back you up
At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin
Don status in the sheets I'm keepin you warm
Ain't no nigga gone do what I do
Imah take care of you and ya kids
Take the bent and go handle ya biz
The bills is paid,the cable back on
I quote you know the seeds want they nickleodeon on
I'm not ashamed to sport you
Floss you or gloss you out
Fat, skinny out of shape I'll dior you out

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Wipe ya eyes..

Yo in the hood there's a struggle
My girls is in trouble
She lackin guidance in the mind she's blinded and puzzled
Her pops never showed her the ropes
Her moms raised mad kids on her own
She never had a strong man in her home

[Keyshia Cole w/ Ghost ad-libs]
Stay stroooooooooong
Oh, hey, said we're gonna stay strong
No matter what
Yeah.. we're still here to see, hey... (that's my baby, that's my baby)

No matter what, you know what I'm saying?

From a hood where niggaz is miserable
Either gon' dead you or leave you in critical
Niggaz talkin' money then show me the visual
And then stand right there and get plucked like a chicken feather
Stickin' up the stick-up kids, nigga I'm sick as ever
The gun is my bitch, and I bet you we stick together
Stuck like two dogs fuckin'
You must be ready to die, fuckin' with me like, you want somethin'
Ring your bell and I have you like ""Who call? ""
Smack you with a bat like Pujols, bottom of the ninth
You don't wanna see me at the bottom of the pint
Rowdy, be outtie cause I'm a problem for the night
Problem for your life, leg or arm missin'
I can step it up, have you doubt or your mom missin'
S.P. the Ghost and I'm trom' hittin'
Arm kickin anytime I'm spittin' nigga just like a bomb hittin'

Yo, yo, yo I'm a tell you how we do on the Island
Squeeze your girl ass, now what, knock your punk ass off balance
You can't come through Mickey D's, no burger no cheese
Find your head missin', do you still want the #3?
Big Mac, large order of 9's, no shake, we got shells
Pissin' on y'all bitches like R. Kell's
And more or less staple your balls together
And light you in kerosene, melt your whole face in your sweater
You see the rubber gloves, thugs
Nervous doctors play in the E.R., still wind up pullin' the plug
Cause it's a Twin Ghost Experience, flesh and spirit
We bang, even the dead listen to deadly lyrics
Make Big turn in his grave, even 'Pac can hear it
Cochran, on Dirt's death, yo they tryin' to appeal it
But fuck that, all we want is the crack, the cash in bags
Come through heavy, you might get yapped, motherfucker!

[Chorus]

[Styles P:]
A lot of niggaz hoped I would die young
Pitched in the hood hard, want me to Cy Young
Real sharp words, guess I got me a fly tongue
Always get high cause I feel high-strung
I don't buy jewels, I buy haze and I buy guns
Or they ""hear me now"" like the dude from Verizon
Look at my eyes son, you won't see the next horizon
Kickin' that typical rap, despicable rap
Or to get a hawk in your face, clip in your back
Guess who, still keep the thing in the sweatsuit
Hot blood leakin' out your face is the best soup
Food in the kitchen nigga, shit in the restroom
Wreck when it's wreck time, S.P. the Ghost is five star
Orders to the death when I rep mine
King and the queen die, just like chess time
If I don't kill you now I'll catch yo' ass next time

Yo, there ain't too many people I would die for
That I would lay down for, you heard...

YouknowImean? My moms and 'em, my babies, man

That's right, man (I'll die for you) Just some real shit...

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I'll die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord
On the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword
With no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause
Just laying me facing the East, when I'm under the floor
I might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects
Eyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience
And more or less, I'm a man of my word
My body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird

[Hook: Ghostface Killah (sample)]
For Martin Luther and my brother Malcolm (I'll die for you)
And my ancestors picking cotton (I'll die for you)
My close homies that get it popping (I'll die for you)
You what time it is, nigga what?

Aiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids
If you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my whiz
Even my mans, if we that tight
Jump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my mics
Or we can brawl it out and take his life
By taking his gun, no problem
Just make sure we eating when we on the run
Like slaves that's chained together, who killed master?
The dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya
I'd die for you, I'd die for my brother
Die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother
I put niggaz lights out like Con Ed, my verbal is barn
My bread'll blow you, show you who's real with the arms

Dog, you want revenge on that devil Satan? (I'll die for you)
We could do it now instead of waiting (I'll die for you)
We don't have to wait for revelations (I'll die for you)
We'll sort this out in other conversations

Yo, I'd never jump out the window, lose my life for a lame ass nigga
That scene is bogus, it's not in the picture
You just can't feed me anything like ""Yo, Tone it's beef""
Expect me to go all out, jump in and bust my heat
First off, drunk, you not my peeps
Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep
We never stuck nothing, oxed something, ran together, popped something

You barking like you got the town in a smash
I'd never lay down for you, faggot nigga, you ass

The way she smile, her face look pretty, though
Hands is soft, feet, no calysses
Her father owned six pallets in palaces
Laying out in New York, crush villas in Vegas
Greatest designer wear, son, she sport the latest
So I, pause the smooth talk, made her a drink
Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked
Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom
Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room
This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths
Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered
""You know what, Ghost, I do hits"" But niggas get fooled
By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch

Travelled the world, only one did jail time
Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case
When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M.
The bars closed, now we at it again
Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past it
Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet
Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking
Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing
These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade

This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it
Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex
This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk
As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets
She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites
Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami
'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow
I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet
If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe
You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds
You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need
You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars
To escaping at, one forty two?
They take Jet Blue for two, into Long Beach

Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness

It was Lolita black down yo

With four other bitches
He had a nasty hammer, fat ass

Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was a ninety shot

And then I bugged out, ran up the steps

They ain't gotta do nothing, but just search them bitches
Let's go...

[Ghostface Killah]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
This is a stick up, I want y'all to lift y'all skirts
I mean shirts, take ya hoodies off, jackets and watches
Before you put ya hands on the wall, empty ya pockets
Fix ya face, this a robbery, nigga, respect the juks
Stop shaking, you making me nervous, I know that you shook
The fuck is that sticking out from under ya foot?
Move, turn ya head around, nigga, you better not look
Stacks, you hiding from Tone? I'll shake, rattle ya bones
You killed him! Nah, hit him with the back of the fucking chrome
In the dark, yo, I do this alone
That's the reason why I don't shake hands, in case I gave you a phone
That's a buck fifty, long hickey, when I strike I do it quickly
Creep up on my victims swiftly, make it hard for you to stick me
Cuz if we shoot it out, cuz if I die tonight you coming with me
Bitch-ass nigga, eat through ya chest like some fucking whiskey

BOY! Gut him like a pig in the dark
Or auction off ya bitch body parts

Get to sticking niggaz for the right prices
BOY! Yeah, this is priceless.. GET 'EM!

Aiyo, I post up, packed the shotti
Black mags in lobbies, with red dots, to detach the body
If you a boss, why ya cash is sloppy?
This a Staten Island burglar gang, ock, not no Ave could stop me
I'm on the road, not no massive robbery
When it come to that dough, it over flow like paper bag tsunamis
I take shit, lumberjacks and Tommy's
Niggaz passing out bombs like Culpepper, so I pass behind 'em
My black glove, black mask, requirements
Sent the order to Trife Dies', and he gon' send 'em fast, they flying in
These cowards couldn't clash our lion's den
That forty-four mag'll twist ya aves and the cav you flying in
We hoping out cabs like Iron Men
It's hard to believe how niggaz leave with no bag supplying sense
Empty cuz my staff is hiring
Canine dogs with felonies duck fast when firing

Aiyo, we carry arms like a octopus
Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book
Blowing all lots of kush
Dark tints on the V so the D's can't spot the crooks
Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks
Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves
Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes
Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used
I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move
If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im
Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im
Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing
We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen
With stones so we decided to yapp 'im
I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action
These ain't E pills, nigga, these is fuckin aspirin

Aiyo, I'm skinned up, Nikes is scuffed, still bugging
Earlier, around four, how I escaped the bus
The way I fell, cracked the face of my watch, my man's chanting me on
Like run, son, don't go up in the spot
Jetting through bushes and backyards, neighbors is ratting me out
Dogs is barking all you hear is the cars
Sirens, I'm trying to think, and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats, got me running funny, you think I'm lying
May God strike me, if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's pounding through my chest
Trying to focus, yup, and make progress
That's what I get for slinging in them projects
Next thing you knew, I'm in this bitch's crib, chilling
Told 'em my story, you'll like this, I had her legs in the ceiling
Cooking me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doing this, the bitch still sliding on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she cracking the Dutch
Playing with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here, miss Lady Wop, where you put the condom box
You finished off the last one, oh shit, I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed the white yorkie
Jetting up the steps, and pig want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like 'ooh', I seen my man Meth going in raw
So he jumped up, balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dying laughing, he said ""Yo, Starks, be quiet""

[Method Man]
And let me put my drawers on, nigga, what dope you on, shit?
Should of knocked, before you came in the spot, Ghost, you wrong
Busting in here on that government shit, got the chick screaming
Grabbing the sheets, trying to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughing, son, I bumped my toe all the nice things
Just run and try to grab the gun
Cuz shit's real, man, you spazzing dunn
There come a time in a man's life, he got to toss his pack and run
You know he family like Crack and Pun, but Mr. G.F.K.
State your business, after that, be one
Now can it be that you hot, lord, you did some shit on the block
That the cops trying to lock you for
Can't believe you blowing the spot, lord, my chick is bugging
You tripping, my dick keep slipping out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting, niggas is calling my horn
Police is hitting every corner we on
Can't understand that it's a thug thing, and in the middle of thought
I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon

I need my money, Meth, going on about them hundred birds
Tell Tone to get at me, on 'em and my clients want work
He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter fact, beep me
Word to mother, lord, sunny got me hurt
You still fucking shorty? I knew it, the big mouth broad
That be yoking my balls out, her little brother wanted two bricks
You know that nigga 'Lipps, he Maybach, on 26
All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick
Tell me foul shit, wild shit, ya'll niggas wear a lot a loud shit

I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travee and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
'Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too

And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl

She from the N.O., but she never told me, and oh so
We at the spot to chill, with a Fugee grill
So ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neil
Second I walked in, the whole room got still
I don't know how to put this but, I'm kind of a big deal
And she conceited, she got a reason
She got her hair did, she got her weave in
And I'ma sweat that out, by the evening

Mink coach, colorful stones and big stacks
Yeah, I was fucking, but you don't get me back like that
Causing me grief, you know me and homey had beef
Now you got me losing my mind, out up in these streets
You'se flamingo, showing your true colors
Heard y'all was ducking down low when you see my brothers
But it's all good, I move from ex to next
Got the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks
Fat bubble, her body's like one of the best
But I don't need to say nothing, ask Kanye West
She eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate
And you mad cause you played ya self, it's your fault, trick

Shot through the heart, the girl caught me
Shot through the block, with him shot gun

Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine, or here go the TEC-9

It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin' sess drinkin' beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected, for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk
I smoke the feet of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, Ya head, get shrunk
The touch of skunk, I be fuckin' bitches by the chunk
My name black, do words wanna play in my dirt?
Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church
I come like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, makin' the fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum frisbee's on my wall, lookin' properly
But come-ly, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers

Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souflee saute for the day

Spread like plague, we drink Hennessee by the jig
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof, Absolut, mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got yo' neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus, when the whole world need us

Is it appetite for destruction
Slap a murder rap on this production, I touch somethin' trust nothin'
Iron Lung, Twisted Metal

Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow

As a rock when I strike target, verbal
Be screamin' on you like a drill sergeant, her-bals

Ghostface Killah,"After laughter, comes tears

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

After laughter, comes tears

I'm the Osirus of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex, the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala

Shoot out the speakers when my guns get Jurassic

Broken down and crafted in seconds

Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force

Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good",You Know I'm No Good [Remix],2008
