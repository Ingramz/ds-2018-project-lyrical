Frank Kammerdeiner,"The sky is black, billy feels bad
Today he thinks that he'd be better off dead
He hears the pain roaring in his head
He'll close his eyes and the world turns red

Her name was hope her hair was blacker than the sky
She had a smile that made the devil cry
She held is hands, looked him in the eye
She said ""believe, believe and everything will be fine.""

Everything will be all right

Today's the day, you can bet on that
I heard her close the door, she ain't looking back
A twist of fate or a stroke of luck
Well, the answer's over there beyond the wishing well

Everything will be all right

Take the fire in your hands
And place it at her feet
Walk upon the mountain
Then you'll sail across the sea
Her eyes are taken from the stars above,

Her voice is five hearts breaking
Her voice is five hearts breaking
Her voice is five hearts breaking

The skies are fire and he's waiting to die
And his heart's as empty as a dead man's eyes
She held his hands, looked him in the eye
She said ""believe, believe and everything will be fine.""

Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right",Five Hearts Breaking,1998
Frank Kammerdeiner,"The last to know, party's over and we won't go
No one to laugh at our jokes anymore
There's the door, don't forget your hat.
The stores are all closed, couldn't buy a break anyway
Saint Jude he couldn't save you or me, I suppose

[Chorus]
More miles than money, look at out lives and it's so funny
More miles than money, we fall in love and it's never funny
We're the last, very last to know.

Last to know, we play the jokers in this minstrel show
Cause no one cares in this showbiz crowd anymore.
Got another cigarette, I'm not quite through with this story yet,
Nothing left here that we should fear, I suppose.

[Chorus: x2]

From the cradle to the grave all the memories never saved
Nothing here that we should fear so I'm told.
As the night slips away and we stumble towards another day
There's nothing more that we can say, I suppose.

[Chorus]",Last to Know,1998
Frank Kammerdeiner,"If you found me lost on your porch one night,
Would you take me in and hold me tight?
And wrap a dream around my head,
In case I tumble out of bed?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

If you found me hanging without a prayer,
Would you cut me down and lay me there?
And wash the sins off of my hands,
So I might get another chance?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

If I lost the buttons on my coat,
And I couldn't find the golden note,
Could I use your hands to find the light,
So I might make it through the night?

So I count my blessings in this world of sin;
The holes in the wall let the cold come in;
Could I use your skin to keep me warm,
So I might make it through the night?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time",One More Time,1998
Frank Kammerdeiner,"Sometimes I come home,
I don't expect too much
The lights are off now
It's only two

How I wish my breath
It didn't hurt so much
Then you'd be up babe
It's only two

Why don't you sleep?
You look as though you need it
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me
Now they mean nothing to me

Well all my friends they laughed,
They laughed at all my jokes
I got one more story,
It's only two

How I wish my tough
Could erase the past
They you'd be up babe
It's only two

Why don't you drink
You look as though you need one
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me,
No, they mean nothing to me

If these were different times
Then you'd be up,
And we'd trade stories
It's only two

Why don't we pretend?
I's all we have between us
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me, now
Why don't you sleep?
You look as though we need it
The barricades and reasons
They mean nothing to me,
Now they mean nothing to me",Pissed Off 2am,1998
Frank Kelly,"Day One
Dear Nuala,
Thank you very much for your lovely present of a partridge in a pear-tree 
We're getting the hang of feeding the partridge now, 
Although it was difficult at first to win its confidence 
It bit the mother rather badly on the hand 
But they're good friends now and we're keeping the pear-tree indoors in a bucket 
Thank you again 
Yours affectionately, Gobnait O'LÃºnasa

Day Two
Dear Nuala,
I cannot tell you how surprised we were to hear from you so soon again and to receive your lovely present of two turtle doves 
You really are too kind 
At first the partridge was very jealous 
And suspicious of the doves and they had a terrible row the night the doves arrived 
We had to send for the vet but the birds are okay again 
And the stitches are due to some out in a week or two 
The vet's bill was 8 but the mother is over her annoyance now 
And the doves and the partridge are watching the telly from the pear-tree as I write Yours ever, Gobnait 

Day Three
Dear Nuala, 
We must be foremost in your thoughts 
I had only posted my letter when the three French hens arrived 
There was another sort-out between the hens and the doves, 
Who sided with the partridge, and the vet had to be sent for again 
The mother was raging because the bill was 16 this time 
But she has almost cooled down 
However, the fact that the birds' droppings keep falling down 
On her hair whilen she's watching the telly, doesn't help matters 
Thanking you for your kindness 
I remain, your Gobnait

Day Four
Dear Nuala,
You mustn't have received my last letter when you were sending us the four calling birds There was pandemonium in the pear-tree again last night and the vet's bill was 32 
The mother is on sedation as I write 
I know you meant no harm and remain your close friend 
Gobnauit

Day Five
Nuala, 
Your generosity knows no bounds 
Five gold rings! When the parcel arrived I was scared stiff that it might be more birds, because the smell in the living-room is atrocious 
However, I don't want to seem ungrateful for the beautiful rings 
Your affectionate friend, Gobnait

Day Six
Nuala,
What are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity 
But the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the calling birds 
But they laid their eggs on top of the vet's head 
From the pear-tree and his bill was 68 in cash ! 
My mother is munching 60 grains of Valium a day 
And talking to herself in a most alarming way 
You must keep your feelings for me in check 
Gobnait

Day Seven
Nuala,
We are not amused by your little joke 
Seven swans-a-swimming is a most romantic idea but not in the bath of a private house 
We cannot use the bathroom now because they've gone completely savage 
And rush the door every time we try to enter 
If things go on this way, the mother and I will smell as bad as the living-room carpet Please lay off It is not fair 
Gobnait

Day Eight
Nuala,
Who the hell do you think gave you the right to send eight, 
Hefty maids-a-milking here, to eat us out of house and home? 
Their cattle are all over the front lawn 
And have trampled the hell out of the mother's rose-beds 
The swans invaded the living-room in a sneak attack 
And the ensuing battle between them and the calling birds, 
Turtle doves, French hens and partridge make the battle 
Of the Somme seem like Wanderly Wagon 
The mother is on a bottle of whiskey a day, as well as the sixty grains of Valium 
I'm very annoyed with you 
Gobnait

Day Nine
Listen you looser!
There's enough pandemonium in this place night and day without nine drummers drumming, while the eight flaming maids-a-milking are beating my poor, old alcoholic mother out of her own kitchen and gobbling everything in sight 
I'm warning you, you're making an enemy of me 
Gobnait

Day Ten
Listen manure-face,
I hope you'll be haunted by the strains of ten pipers piping 
Which you sent to torment us last night 
They were aided in their evil work by those maniac drummers 
And it wasn't a pleasant sight to look out the window 
And see eight hefty maids-a-milking pogo-ing around with the ensuing punk-rock uproar 
My mother has just finished her third bottle of whiskey, 
On top of a hundred and twenty four grains of Valium 
You'll get yours! 
Gobnait O'LÃºnasa

Day Eleven
You have scandalized my mother, you dirty Jezebel,
It was bad enough to have eight maids-a-milking dancing to punk music on the front lawn but they've now been joined by your friends the eleven Lords-a-leaping 
And the antics of the whole lot of them would leave 
The most decadent days of the Roman Empire looking like Outlook 
I'll get you yet, you loud bag! 

Day Twelve
Listen slurry head,
You have ruined our lives 
The twelve maidens dancing turned up last night 
And beat the living daylights out of the eight maids-a-milking, 
'Cause they found them carrying on with the eleven Lords-a-leaping 
Meanwhile, the swans got out of the living-room, 
Where they'd been hiding since the big battle, 
And savaged hell out of the Lords and all the Maids 
There were eight ambulances here last night, and the local Civil Defence as well 
The mother is in a home for the bewildered 
And I'm sitting here, up to my neck in birds' droppings, empty whiskey 
And Valium bottles, birds' blood and feathers, 
While the flaming cows eat the leaves off the pear-tree 
I'm a broken man",Christmas Countdown,1996
Frank Kimbrough,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice",You Only Live Twice,2004
Frank Kowalski,"If there were no words
no way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
no way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
untill the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
cause all I need is you my valentine
oh
you're all I need, my love, my valentine",Valentine,2004
Frank Kowalski,"Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
It's a miracle in itself  
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's heart sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

There are some nights
I watch you while you dream
I swear I hear the sound of beating wings",Wild Angels,2004
Frank Lamphere,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows,2002
Frank Lamphere,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire

And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

And only happen in a town like this

As I throw each one of you a kiss

This is my kind of town, Chicago is

My kind of people too
People who smile at you

And each time I roam, Chicago is
Calling me home, Chicago is

Frank Lamphere,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

The earth for you
To prove my love, dear
And its worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Yau [echo 2x Yau]
They still won't give me my props
Now I'm pissed off
why'all will see the other side of me
Come on
Like this

I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be
If a nigga didn't make his entry
Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats
Waiting on my arrivlary
why'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me
Instead of always comparin' me
If I hear one more remark about me
I guess I gotta ride on my enemies

Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga

What the fuck would the music be, if it wasn't for Timothy
When the game is feverish, then I create the remedies
And crumble leads until I'm buzz and I'm laxed
And them hoes show me love in every club that I'm at
For every hood got' get back, what another nigga envy
But I swear I ain't no killer, but why'all niggaz 'bout to tempt me
To the point there the barrels empty until you gon' recent me
When Morpheus missing the desert of the real he meant me
Like a monster I am simply, do the records into three
Let my music not really be confused with anybody
'cause there's something like Mister Mohammed Ali in his prime
then I float like a butterfly and sting with the rhyme
and the mic happens ring with the nine
if it's drama let these niggaz tryin' to bring to my mind
I seem to remind that Thomas Crown is spoke
and if you don't love it you can shove a dick down your throat

I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be
If a nigga didn't make his entry
Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats
Waiting on my arrivlary
why'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me
Instead of always comparin' me
If I hear one more remark about me

Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho
Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there
Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga

Look at my eyes nigga, wakin' up early in the morning to the sun rise nigga
Momma yelling rise nigga get up out that bed snoarin'
if you want it go get it fuck havin' to beg for it
Even if you gotta break your neck I'm a releg for it
I said listen to behind a hot roller bread for it
Contemplating know how to work my math and bred story
I don't work my fingers to the bone until they bled storin'
So you can say that I'm a giant a preacher of habit
walking over these watches squaking the reach in the head with
niggaz watching me go free not just a week in my marriage
with the game in the cabbage with my name and my status
but I remain as the baddest motherfucker 's established
and I 'm still at it grounding that Hennessey straight popping that still mad at
Down at my enemies' face and you're like a kill habit
In front of my enemies' face I shit like a steal rabbit
To show I'm his real static and hold me ideal at it
With my poker face until I at least make a mil at it
At least make a meal love it I'm hungry and still clutch it
All for that mil ticket outta that steal lovin'

Well I was riding 95 to Virginia the other day
And I thought to myself ain't this where Timbaland used to stay
I heard he moved to New York City but he work in Miami
Only time he back round here is when he visit his granny
Now ain't it funny how the money make a man change
But shit Timmy I don't think he changed a damn things
'xcept the rap game and bust the track game
shit he be gobbeling the grammies like he pac-man
can you get with that man let's gone take it back to the roots
before them backpacking rappers with them hoodies and boots
before Sam Goddie and MTV
before these killers and these hundred dollar billars feeling making MC

Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Lookin DOWN on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marchin up the avenue
Doin what they gotta do, just to get by

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump""
Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street
He keeps hearin noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for women's lib

but you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it

Frank Loesser,"It says here: 
The average unmarried female 
Basically insecure 
Due to some long frustration may react 
With psychosomatic symptoms 
Difficult to endure 
Affecting the upper respiratory tract. 

In other words, just from waiting around for that plain little band of gold 
A person can develop a cold. 

You can spray her wherever you figure there's streptococci lurk 
You can give her a shot for whatever's she's got, but it just won't work 
If she's tired of getting the fish eye from the hotel clerk 
A person can develop a cold.

The female remaining single 
Just in the legal sense 
Shows a neurotic tendency, see note: (looks at note) 
Chronic organic symptoms 
Toxic or hyper tense 
Involving the eye, the ear, the nose, and throat. 

In other words, just from worrying if the wedding is on or off 
A person can develop a cough. 

You can feed her all day with the vitamin A and the bromofizz 
But the medicine never gets anywhere near where the trouble is. 
If she's getting a kind of name for herself, and the name ain't his 
A person can develop a cough. 

And further more, just from stalling, and stalling, 
And stalling the wedding trip 
A person can develop la grippe. 

When they get on that train to Niagara 
And she can hear church bells chime 
The compartment is air conditioned 
And the mood sublime 
Then they get off at Saratoga for the fourteenth time! 
A person can develop la grippe, 
La grippe. 
La post nasal drip. 
With the wheezes 
And the sneezes 
And a sinus that's really a pip! 

From a lack of community property 
And a feeling she's getting to old 
A person can develop a bad, bad cold!",Adelaide,1992

In the light of the morning sun
Perhaps within the jug I draw
I'll find the bliss of yesterday

Oh fill it up for me
Fill it with happiness

Now quench mine

In the hills of Canaan
My heart calls out
But only the south wind responds

Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Frank Mendenhall,"This world has no patience, time
It's spinning while we're wasting, time
In roadblocks, subway stations, time
We're waiting wasting time

Well life takes a turn
Let's keep on straight
It's easy to burn
On stolen faith

Give in, give out
Give in and get out with me
Give in, give out
Give in and give it to me

Give in, give out
Give in and get out with me
Give in, give out
Give in and give it to me

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood

Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy can play

In a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark,

Frank Mills,"You walk in the room and you're wearing a frown
You reach for the shelf and cradle it down
The Music Box Dancer, what does it prove
Only that you need to see a statue that moves
A tutu of satin, bordered with lace
Slender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face
Her beauty is balanced, an immovable pose
Eternally destined to remain on her toes

Music Box Dancer, she is only a toy
Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy
She's perched on her stand, and never will part
A final gaze upon her, now the music will start

You wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because
You've been here before, so give one final pause
To dream of the future, to reflect on the past
Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last

The room fills with music, such a cute song
Watching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs
Bring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow
Whenever wound up, she'll put on a good show

Music Box Dancer, do you think or believe
She could step off her box if she wanted to leave
So easy it is, twirl around with such grace
Staying in her circle, she remains in one place

Such a brief moment, a small time to spend
The dancing will slow soon, the music will end
In real life we're plastic, nature's unfair
How can we breathe life, how can we share
The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs
We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms
We sit on our shelves where objects reside
We don't allow the music to get right inside

Music Box Dancer's now completely alone
No winder or no listener, because nobody's home
How long before someone will re-wind the spring?
The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing",Music Box Dancer,1994

On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even

""Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""

""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.""
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted

I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo.

Frank Morgan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1989

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Down in Alabama they call me the man of joy
I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't fall in love with a Ramblin' Man

You better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little heart won't be the same

I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't mess around with a Ramblin' Man",Ramblin' Man,2004
Frank Nino,"Come on, come on
Come on give me that double give me that double, Give it to me
You never knew what it took to get here
They say life don't stop for no one
So I'm going back in my people
This what ya'll wanted right? You said you wanted the truth
So I solemnly swear, that the truth be told I'm thuggin to the day I die
It's Dipset, it's more than just music now
It's a way of life, it's more than the 200 hundred years of blood sweat and tears
Ho stand me? For all my ballers, my day crawlers... It's bigger than Nino Brown

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

It must of been a obsession, Had to make it large (Dreams)
Started my progression, I'd stay stayed with the huds (Down South)
Now it's private jets, smokin' haze what the stars (G4)
Quarter mill write the check is how we for the car (What's The Price?)
Switchin' lanes up 7th, Are we racin' the cars (Harlem)
But the boys still stressin', I'm facin' the charge (Yay-Ya Be Trippin')
Still prayin' to God, Cause lifes not promised, not even manana (Fuck tomorrow)
Remember movin' bricks, paranoid bout ehanas
Or even at the club, an them boys and then behind us
I'm chasin' death, gettin' closer to 30 (Gettin Older)
Sunny outside, but the work is dirty
Days out, Harlem nights, over in Jersey
In my rare view goin' home cause the vultures is thirsty (I See Em)
Pull that doubt you won't catch me in traffic
Dark tints on the V, when I lack it's the ratchet, bastidd

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

Now I'm the leader of the pack, Can't help to think back
How I was eager to sell crack, I thought it was the shit (Damn)
When they talk about my influence, I thought of uncle Ricky (Uncle Ricky Wha's Good)
He used to call up on his flip, he start snortin' on his shit
The same life had me gas'd, when I bought my first vic
I was heavy on the gas, when I bought my first whip
I thought I was the shit, you couldn't tell me nothing
I was 16, I told the teacha ""You can feel me fuck em"" (Feel Me Nigga)
Just any suits, pullin' up to club in Beamer coups
Gettin' cash (Gettin' Cash)
We livin' fast (Fast)
Different women every night, couple of bitches clashed (Fuck You Bitches)
I just laughed (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, Now Listen)
I almost got wiped out on the wave, Thought 11 was tsunami
For the prices of the yay (Fuck The City Up)
The hustlas, they know the saga of the story (I Know The Story)
We live sucka free and show problems to authority

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

One... Two, Feds comin' for you
Three... Four, Betta' watch the law
Five... Six, If you start pumpin' bricks
Seven... Eight, hope it ain't heavy weight

Ferrari dreams, feds spooked me in my nightmare
I tried to scream like Freddy Kruegers' in my nightmare (Livin' For The Fame)
So a nigga scared to go to sleep
Until the day break, I'm tearin' up the street
Porsche'n with the clutch, ballin' like the play off's
Top goin' 40 on the floor, with the safe off
12 car convoyed a road full of race cars
Till' the pilot give me 5 minutes before he take off (Roll Up)

[Chorus]
Take a walk, lets slide
Take a journey wit ya' boy and lets ride
You don't even need a seat belt homie
Cause where I'm bout to take you
You don't need nothin' homie
And I don't need nothin' on me
But a bottle purple juice and my weed smoke homie
I just need you in the zone, take ya' oastar off and make yaself at home

That's my conclusion... See it's the fast life we livin'...
So I'm ah tell you, if you in the left lane
Keep going cause they right on your heels nigga (Squalieee)
And if they catch you, that's your ass...
And if you blink nigga, your life could be over (We Got No Time For Sleep)
I keep sayin' the rap game is like the crack game
Cause we could all end up dead or in jail
They got us under surveillance...
And to all my niggas behind the g-wall (My Soldiers)
Inhale, exhale... Shake your nuts if you have to (East Side)
And all the political soldiers that ain't never comin' home (RIP Too)
To all my homies, East Side...
While you in your cell, raise hell to this (Roll Call)
I do this for ya'll (Dipset)... I feel ya' pain (I'm On The Same Route)
I know what it's like hittin' the streets at ah early age to deal cocaine (It's Ah Cold World)
Survival, It's all about the struggle (We Gotta' Eat)...
So I dedicate this to you (My Soldiers)
Keep your head up and your eyes open...
Stay focused, It's us against them
I'd never let them take me alive, take me alive..

Take a journey wit ya' boy, let's ride..

Right before the fun was about to begin) 
Yo yo  one bitten  jabberjaws  tryin' to taste the

Them broads love my shitty drawers, the finest 
Criminal minded put my life behind it, you niggaz 
Find it hard to swallow poison in the bottle, she too sexy 
So I gotta watch you fast bitches, too many tricks 
That can give a dick a bad sickness

To catch a nigga gettin' gassed, puttin' ten on three

Pull them panties up, party's over, in the cut 
Slappin' grudges offa niggaz shoulder, bringin' ruck

Of the universe, stole-a, colder than cola 
Caps grab your hoodie hat, Island of Stat'

Stage dived, made a mistake, kicked F.O.I.

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

Bitch I'm making chip off sales while sipping on White Zinfandael
Probably sipping still cause it is my favorite flavor

They call the po-po, I'm cocking back the fo'-fo'
The one man army, my automatic Rose Gold
Double O, subtract one numero from Seven
Taking niggas back to school like a bus ride for adolescence
Wolves plotting for their future like fucking investments
And I go so hard, that's why your bitch keep on caressing
Flat iron and pressing my VCR buttons
But this a DVD so you can watch it with your cousins
2010, bitch we get it in
Go ahead and tell your friends, I hope them bitches be twins
Doobies in Jacuzzi's, white bitches with big booties

Sitting on a haystack, we go off like grenade caps)
Makeshift millions, knocking down your buildings
Know they fear me I'm a villain, stacking dollars to the ceiling

Balling like Camby, organic like cran' be
Glass house on a beach for when I want to get sandy
Everything is dandy, ask my nigga Handy
I take a strike in L.A. Lights like I'm dodging with Manny
Girls drop them panties, even their aunties... no grannies
Grandma, I'm leaking on the beat like a tampon
Fool, I'm spitting 'til my whole Odd Future camps on
We get our camp on, Jansport and Eddie Bauer
Stay fresh before hopping up in any shower
Death to haters tryna take minutes up off my hour
I got the hood with me, I'm the nigga with the power
Weed, cocaine, and the muthafuckin' Zannies

She can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag, poppin' tags on the Ave
But she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her in the Swagger I rode in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it?
Seem to be attracted by the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold
If we are a couple, let's go
To the place where we lead in the life ?

Frank Ocean,"Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad hyenas in vagina's
I'm the fliest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blond Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga?
We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man?
You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building",Window,2011
Frank Ocean,"I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

M-r- s dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive
Then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor unamerican girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave
Land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said I've had a hell of a summer
So baby
Don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way to far

It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

Well you can have my mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Girl if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway

Who's that talking in my library?

Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special, every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, and keep living, and keep loving

And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust

Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without your smile
Nothing special, I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing, I kept living, I kept loving

And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust",Dust,2011

I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'

If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try to bus with me
But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun
We could go to my house after school after school, after school
Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late, off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah

I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah

Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more, no more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me

If I sing songs to get at women
I say naw they say okay I don't believe it
I say nope I swear I never do it

Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing

Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times

And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean

Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

I'm going off, don't try saving
No flares, no vest, and no fear
Waves are washing me (out)

It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty super power

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Too much to bare
Super power

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would move on
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't tow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down",Superpower,2013
Frank Ocean,"I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate
About half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult
To admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue
And I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry
The music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just driftin'
I'm not complainin'
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving
I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit
On cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the laundry
State to state for the profit
it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet
I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded
and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit
I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance
I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
She, she seems that

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different
I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like

Iâm coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat
left you at terminal three
Iâll meet you down at baggage claim
in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, donât cry
You know I canât live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But Iâd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly please
Palm, no marijuana trees
Yo hickeys on my aorta and tattoos you could only see
When Iâm playing surfboarder, put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen, just to wear
that straight edge varsity you thinkâs cool
They thought me soft in High School
thank God Iâm jagged
Forgot you donât like it rough
I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when Iâm aiming my gun
And whyâs his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples
I got my Grammyâs and gold
Polka dots on my brit
Iâm not supposed to be stunting
Itâs all melodic this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep
But Iâm just jet-lagged is all, and restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different
I don't like you a lot
I  mean, fuck

I donât know what weâre about
What good is West Coast weather if youâre bi-polar?
If Iâma need this sweater
Iâd rather be where itâs cold
Where it snows
I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls
I know theyâre coming in droves

Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you see

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

Better not pout, I am telling you why

Going to find out who is naughty and who is nice

He knows when you are wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

It's lonesome through the day and all the night

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Midnight - not a sound from the pavement.
Has the moon lost her memory,
she is smiling alone.
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet.
and the wind begins to moan.

Memory - all alone in the moonlight.
I can smile at the old days,
I was beautiful then.
I remember the time I knew what happiness was.
Let the memory live again.

Every street light seems to beat a fatalistic warning.
Someone mutters and the streetlamp gutters,
and soon it will be morning.

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise.
I must think of a new life,
and I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too,
and a new day will begin.

Burnt out ends of smokey days,
the stale cold smell of morning.
The streetlamp dies, another night is over,
another day is dawning.

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory
of my days in the sun.
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is.
Look, a new day has begun.

Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.


Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.


Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.


I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.


I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.

Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere.


I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me.


As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul.

",Precious Memories,1999
Frank Patterson,"""God Bless America""
By Irving Berlin

While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,
 let us swear allegiance to a land that's free.
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
 raise our voices in a solemn prayer.

God Bless America, land that I love.
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above.
From the mountians, to the prairies,
To the oceans white with foam.
God Bless America, my home sweet home.
God Bless America, my home sweet home.

Frank Patterson,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Although you're with somebody new
Thought I drop a line to say 
That I wish this happy day would find me beside you.

Frank Pellico,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1998

Frank Perowsky,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Makes no diff'rence where you are,

And when I dream the words are missing
Yes I know that in a room so full of light
That all the light is missing

Through the door you've opened
Close inside of me the light you see
That you met in the darkness

Would I have to find them alone
Without true light of my own?

On ships over seas
That I now know
No, they don't exist anymore

I sit alone and dream of the horizon
Then I'd know that you are here with me
Building bridges over land and sea
Shine a blinding light for you and me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

More lost without you and so it goes

Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

I want to lead you into Nature's hall

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Tho' I tried

Easy come and easy go

The wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains

Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Had lost its charm

I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining, shining, shining, shining, shining everywhere

But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some they may go for a cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You,1954

It worries me
You seem to be unhappy
And that worries me

I hate to think that maybe
I have made you blue
Just what did I do
Was I mean to you
Wish I knew

I worry so
If anything is wrong
I have the right to know

So while I hold you close
And kiss you tenderly
Tell it all to me
Darling can't you see
Anything that worries you, worries me

Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable

Is your mouth a little week?

Are you smart?

That I left in old Monterey

Lips, red as wine

I left her and I threw away the key to paradise

Our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but ever and a day

Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

cho: Noel, Noel
Noel,Noel
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.
And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
Then they did know assuredly

Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.
Then entered in those wise men three,

Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
If we in our time do well

We shall be free from death and hell
For God hath prepared for us all

The conversation with the flying plates

The words, ""I'll love you 'til the day I die""

When love congeals it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

And there is no one waiting there for you
Then it's a lonely town
You wander up and down
The crowds rush by
A million faces pass before your eyes
Still it's a lonely town
Unless there's love
A love that's shining
Like a harbor light
You're lost in the night
Unless there's love
The world's an empty place
And every town's

Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems

We've got nothin' in common at all

Frank Sinatra,"Love was like a song, a lovely melody
Our hearts would sing along in perfect harmony
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune

Each time our lips would cling, I heard a serenade
Of love and youth and spring forever to be played
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune

We used to dance instead of walk
We used to sing instead of talk
Why was our love song that used to be
Only the start of the blues for me

But songs are funny things, they never really die
And so my hope still clings that someday you will try
To just remember the words
For I still remember the tune

When lonely lamps are lit and midnight songs will start
One song I must admit still fills my hopeful heart
So please remember the words
For I still remember the tune

There was no end, a million dreams ago",A Million Dreams Ago,1961
Frank Sinatra,"I used to walk with you along the avenue, our hearts were young and gay,
How could I know I'd lose you somewhere along the way.
The friends we used to know, would always smile hello,
No love like our love, they say then love slipped through our fingers,
Somewhere along the way.
I should forget, but with the loneliness of night, I start remembering everything,
You're gone and yet there's still a feeling deep inside that you'll always be part of me.
So now I look for you along the avenue, and as I wander I pray
That someday soon, I'll find you, somewhere along the way.",Somewhere Along the Way,1961
Frank Sinatra,"There will be many other nights like this,
And I'll be standing here with someone new,
There will be other songs to sing, another fall, another spring,
But there will never be another you.
There will be other lips that I may kiss,
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do,
Yes, I may dream a million dreams,
But how can they come true,
If there will never ever be another you.",There Will Never Be Another You,1961
