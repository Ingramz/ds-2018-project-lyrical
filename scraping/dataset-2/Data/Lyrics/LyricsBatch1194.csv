Thousands of One,"Got a picture of your house and you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded and it's looking pretty worn
I see the factory that I worked silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray but, man, they're really coming back
I don't need to be the king of the world 
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl
 
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
 
How I love the way you move and the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them like a blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night and you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you so I can feel you breath
I don't need to be a superman 
As long as you will always be my biggest fan
 
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah
 
Now the lights are going out, along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back and it makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go, no one really cares
I don't know what to do but I'm never giving up on you
 
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way

Heaven, oh, oh, oh 
Heaven, oh, oh, oh 
Heaven, it's not too far away
Oh, oh, oh, yeah",Heaven,2005
ThouShaltNot,"The hurricane that blew last night worked wonders
The house is torn, the line is cut; now we see with real eyes
And talk with words that matter and I am not your shelter
As the wind ripped everything I finally felt my lungs expanding
Walk away from the before and into now
Walk away out of the old skin when the old skin's drowned beneath the clouds
Walk away when all the world has blown apart
Walk away into the wet grass when the end is making new the start
Are you the same after the rain? Are you stripped too?
Or is your air overcome by the thought of breathing and perceiving?
Is there a way to make a storm from nothing?
We'd break apart the gallery and with the sky all drained you'd stare for miles
I'm lying out in the rain
I wait for the hurricane
To wash over me ecstatic and free
To help me to see what I have chosen",Walk Away [#],2006
Thrasher Dream Trio,"What's it all about, Alfie
Is it just for the moment we live
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie",Alfie,2015
Thrasher Dream Trio,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Thrasher Dream Trio,"Hey, little girl
Comb your hair, fix your make-up
Soon he will open the door
Don't think because
There's a ring on your finger
You needn't try any more

For wives should always be lovers, too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
I'm warning you

Day after day
There are girls at the office
And men will always be men
Don't send him off
With your hair still in curlers
You may not see him again

For wives should always be lovers, too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here

Hey, little girl
Better wear something pretty
Something you'd wear to go to the city
And dim all the lights
Pour the wine, start the music
Time to get ready for love

Oh, time to get ready
Time to get ready
Time to get ready
For love",Wives and Lovers,2015
Thread,"When I awoke on Friday Morning
I couldn't get the airplanes from my head 
I held my baby a little closer
And spent the day in bed 
I laid there thinkin bought tomorrow's
All the goods I  need and all I have 
Something's bound to make or break me
Back in Amsterdam  
 Will you bathe me in a chest of Spanish gold
Or tear away the promise from the miners only soul
Spin the whell of fortune risking everything 
I am All or nothing back in Amsterdam
Whoa no, Back in Amsterdam 
We're on the busk forever after
Pass the hat around the blond cafes  
Every terrace ringing with the laughter
The organ grinder made 
Play to Vondel Park on every Sunday 
Sing enought to slepp my only plan 
Allaround the rivers overflowing 
Back in Amsterdam 
Will your forces fall a fortune in my hand
Or lurk around the corner changing passion to demand
Spin the wheel of fortune risking everything I am
Run the river back in Amsterdam
Whoa no, Back in Amsterdam 
There's life around the corner, sometimes life just dissappearslike romance in the married years
I fear the bread and roses, a settled life would offer me
So take me where I long to be back in Amsterdam  
No No No No in Amsterdam 
Take me where I want to be 
Lo Lo No  No in Amsterdam  
Oh take me back, Jim",Amsterdam,1998
Threat,"Let it rain, let it drip, damn them niggaz tripped
On the turf, they gotta get us work
We know where you stay, the homies don't play
You knew the consequences now your ass is hoppin fences
Tryin to get away from the AK spray in the broad day
Now they cross us out and put a K
I'm still PDKiller, cause if you ain't my friend
Youse a foe, and I'ma let you know that I'm from
That big bad mad-ass Westside numero uno
South Central, is ill mental
Uhh, and all these new tribes tryin to hoo-ride
We can't be eighty-six, cause we from sixty-nine
It's just a fifteen minus ten with the S on the end
For life, so do what you like
But you better bomb first with the sleeper, uhh
Cause I'ma blow you out your Converse sneakers-ah, so surprise!
Punk is the ride, punk
You thought your homey next to you made it to his trunk, uhh
Light 'em up like a candle, that's right
The scandal, vandal handle mines like a man doe
Creep by the police, rollin fo' deep
Playin low, cause I know they gon' stretch us if they catch us
Up to Chiffaro(?) and away we go
And I bet nobody bet' not get no less than the next
Fo' niggaz, three straps, where these hoes at?
Lookin for some trouble just bust a nigga bubble
They want to unite, but the system's too tight, so
Let these niggaz know what that South Central like
Don't flag no flag cause all that's drag
Stay close to my holster had enough of these busters
Teach 'em not to fuck with the young buck
With the dumb dumb tips, that's right, they hurt like a bitch
Suspects headin West, L.A. Zoo next exit
Damn right baby, I sex it like I flex it
Up jump the boogie got busy with them enemies
Laugh when we serve 'em, hit the corner swervin
Headin down the backstreets, bumpin Black Sheep
Stop and get a quart went home and took my ass to sleep

Can't sleep
Cause niggaz don't know how to act like they momma's on crack
Shit they got so bad much worse than all these hearses
Death toll went up crazy since 1980
Hip-Hop, you don't stop, close up shop
Or get the rope with the slipknot
Hear the tick-tock wake your ass up knock knock who is it?
The Big Bad Wolf come to pay your ass a visit
Count to fifteen, I'm hearin si-rens
Count to fifteen again more si-rens
When will it cease they say everyday
Not 'til the mission is complete, rescued by the fleet
From this Desert Storm, I can see his horns of
Usin heavy metal like the rest of these devils
All these white sheets need they ass be tied
To the bumper, and drug down the street fo' deep

Fo' deep.. fo' deep",4 Deep,1993
Threat,"Tick, tock, you don't, stop
My rhymes got 'em strung like dope, rocks
And now I got a fat enough wallet
To buy a cowboy the plus his dog Spot
Huh, watch it as I drop it
Atomic bomb is better known as the chronic
For ninety-one and ninety-two, I'ma serve
I've got somethin' for Officer Bird, see
Ain't no way y'all gon' have me in the mall with no VIN check
Wishin' with my hands on the glass like Windex
I gotta have it like a rabbit
So the first bitch that walk up get tossed up like a salad
Tell 'em Bob (what?) you know how we do it loc'
Break they bedpost then get ghost (yup)
Check they pulse (right)
And if they pass out, they just ass out

So just stay off my dick nigga
And tell yo' bitch that I want to put this in her
Strip her ass butt-naked like paint thinner
'Cause a nigga ain't nothin' but a chicken dinner
So if you got a bitch that try to just play you like a video game
Tell 'em any old thing, yeah
'Cause now I got riches, bitches
Be knockin' on my door like Jehovah Witness, for instance
This one particular hoe hum
With her big ol' nigga lookin' like Lou Ferrigno
The nigga's pissed off, it's his fault
If he wasn't on my dick he wouldn't a noticed her lip gloss
Who got an instant replay, he say
Niggaz hoppin' on and off the bitch like a freeway
She kept her mouth down South
On my fly, kiss her ass goodbye

If it's a bitch what, a one-eighty-seven
Stuck for the homies my ass, and you can tell 'em
Two choices, either the police get ya
Or the next door neighbor's doberman pincher
And fuck around, ass be to' up
Lookin' like a plain-ass doughnut
I should a known when I was told it was niggaz in a Brougham
Holdin' walkie-talkie microphones
Why me, a nigga gotta stay sucka free
Jake can't fuck with me
Surround the whole block, a helicopter never stopped a fox
Especially if he's sly
But if you ain't fly
Kiss yo' ass goodbye
So kiss your ass goodbye",Ass Out,1993
Threat,"[Threat]
Who is this at my do'?
It's the three pigs with a two-by-fo'
They must be lookin for John Doe
Well anyway, motherfucker here I go
So catch me if you can
While I'm divin out the back window like a stunt man
They got me jumpin - in and out of backgrounds like a track star
Makin the canine on my trail look like a snail
Movin fast but he can't get close
e-nough to me cause I got ghost
On my five-oh-ones, I'm on the run
One-time got the gun and they after me
Homies dove to the back
And dove out the window like Fall Guy
We in the mix, hittin fence after fence
Rin Tin Tin picked up the scent
They got the infrared, hoverin above my head
Aimin pistols with backup from wench hoes
But they can't get close enough
to put the tazer on me, or my homies
But they'll love to just bust me snuff me
and cuff me and then say fuck me..

Hurdlin backgrounds like a track star
Every dog in the neighborhood keep on barkin
Givin up the fo'-one-one
I think I better throw my gun
Cause I know it got murders on it, but I'm fine and
as long as mine, ain't no, frail nine
Fuck it, peel 'em off somethin proper
Nineteen shot helicopter stopper
Got away clean without a scratch
Stepped in so much dog shit they couldn't sniff my prints
Lay low, lay low as a mouse
One time staked house all in front of my house
So I got no choice it seems
but to switch from khakis to huge jeans
Had the homie hook me up with a fade
Cause L7's don't wear braids
One Adam 12, callin all cars
Lookin for a nigga in all stalls
But they can't do it..
Parked the six-fo' and jumped in a Buick and I'm gone",Get Ghost,1993
Threat,"[Threat]
I told you every nigga on my block, won't stop
One time rather send RoboCop
Cause comin down my block is like comin out the pockets
Damn it's hard to see behind a stocking (mask)
Niggaz get sniped in broad daylight
So imagine what the fuck go on at night well let me tell you
The holy's, the two-lows and, who knows
The nigga had some sales but now they gone, where they at?
In the back of my El Camino, my homie Deano
sold 'em to me half price cause he knew me
Then I went straight to the paint and a throw cost a bank
So who the fuck can I date?
Eeney-meenie-meenie-miney-moe, whatchu' got?
Very next stop - hydraulic shop
I used to have a 211 case but they dropped it
So turn around punk so I can check yo' back pockets

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
{*scratch*} ""Tie 'em up"" - give it up
""Somebody gots ta.."" - give it up

[Threat]
Roll through the hood and say whassup to the homies
Put two hundred on the forties
And hit the switch and let the ass on the six just drag
Showin off my rim no gold knockoff (""oh no!"")
Clownin this like side to side, front to back
So you can get with this or get with that
It's ninety-two but if you do bring a crew cause the L.A. Zoo
is straight puttin niggaz on Q..
They just mad cause they can't get with the
niggaz who be talkin that ol' fly pimp shit
Cause they don't want to slang, they'd rather smoke
Comin up short, accidentally coppin soap (damn!)
Only the strongest survive the longest
All my G homies put me up on it
So watch cause if you watch it's too big
Hers and his you know what time it is, come out the pockets

[Chorus]

[Threat]
Gank the rich and give to the poor
And that's for makin momma do the floors
It ain't no way in a fuck y'all can make a butler
out a Westside, hard time hustler (like me)
I'd rather see a grave, than be a slave
On front page on the stage with a twenty gauge
Cause ropes and whips and belts don't help
So you can bail that motherfuckin hay yo'self
For five-twenty-five they must be high
Smokin up three and fo' chickens at once
Servin them thangs like Burger King
So let me show you love on a fat dub
But I didn't know he was a NARC with the police department
Then again I wouldn't know I never seen the seargeant
sucker, now I'm stuck up like a (?)
And tell my bitch to come get me up out this motherfucker
Jammed, cause, Uncle Sam
is givin ten years for every damn gram (""Bam!"")
You want to throw away me and throw away the key
And stick me in the dungeon with the criminals, him and those
deputies, kickin those refugees
I made bail punk so you can have my bunk

Suckers stand back, fathers swear they hard
Big black boots, let the dogs loose
Woof, woof, woof, woof!
Not just 3-D, funky like a fat sack of chronic
At rap so make your woofers crack
Pull guns then roses, clubs, closes now
Cause we shut this motherfucker down
See a fight, a fight, a nigga and a white
Got snatched out his truck but now he's alright
That's all I can say, better him than me
Jack and reportin, snatchin big quotas
The media, made it, gang related
But if your momma woulda got it then a homicide
Get ready for a stand cause shit done hit the fan
Oh what a bummer, another crazy ass summer
Call they bluff, cause they don't have enough
Handcuffs, to serve us
And next time it jump off, no squealin
Just kill and let the dogs loose
Then reach for the ceiling

Fuck peace, no justice, no busters
And the war don't stop with the crooked cops
Highway patrol and the sheriffs and the rangers

Help buy a ninety-three fin
Got them mac-10's and them big fat hens
A nigga like me out to straight check it in
I seen far too lean fall for less than a penny
Only the strong survive this long scary ride
Bad with a light saber like Darth Vader
Blastin like Space Invaders on these perpetrators
Sewed up the block from all the snaps I plot
From what they tell us niggaz jealous of the grip don't even trip cause
Twenty-fo' seven, souls go to heaven but
Some don't make it take it how you want to take it
Let the dogs loose

I gotta bust one mo' for those on death row
'Cause when I get the keys that's who I'm lettin go
They say they won't attack, but you know they want to cuff 'em
I know they ain't built two new jails for nothin
Still get smoked on Normandy and Florence
All the way from Arizona to Torrence
Don't get jacked by the ripper

Where was yo' ass when war was declared?
Sittin back relaxin givin orders like some captain
while I'm on the frontline, down for mine
Oh with no pass, ass good as grass
What I mean next you're seen you might be green
Send me on a mission too hot, get out the kitchen
blame this fire, can't get caught, I got pryors
Riskin my life for the turf or some stripes
and they don't give a fuck, so I don't give a fuck
I trust my own eyes, they tell no lies
Came down on your heads and mines, all the lost lives

Believe, me, fat meat is greasy

Insane no brain I don't need no gang

Pull out the M-1 and move the crowd
Niggas want to set-trip it's time to start the checklist
Don't twitch and get smoked for that little-ass necklace

Kickin my rhymes, thumpin my bongos
But we can't let the zebras see us
Cause them motherfuckers want to Rodney King, us
Sippin on some brass monkey
Just because he got a back street gon' punk me
Where's your spear, you betta betta keep it on your side
Cause I can throw mines, nineteen times
He jumped out and aimed, I whipped out my bang
Bang, bang, now pick up his brains
I was only huntin for fish
But I came up on a coat for my bitch
Money used to grow on trees, but the thieves
started snatchin leaves, they're like piranhas
They love Americanas
Catch 'em while they slippin when they go into they Hondas
Wise as an owl, but crazy as a crocodile
They can't fuck with the chocolate child
Prices as high as nuts on a giraffe
and expect us to kiss her ass
Guess we stuck like a goose, five it's hard tryin to stay alive
when you got beef with two or three tribes
Raised up with lions and cheetahs
Fightin for freedom, in the wild kingdom
Tarzan got captured by the rapture
Ran up in his hut like nigga this is what's up
Swung back to the hood, did dark in the woods
Hungry like a pack of wolves, up to no good
So you can act real nutty if you want to
Got pretty bank for your big break lawyer
Stuck can't escape, for no tellin how many days
Let's just say, enough to make a man go insane {AHHHHHH!}
Can't get enough, buckwild like Billygoat Gruff
And the homies don't give a mad fuck
All I can do is tell 'em can't stop the 211

Tribe so deep, niggaz comin through mobbin
through the fourth row garden no bank and park
Put the pipe down, put the pipe down, maybe you trippin

Ooh, it's the LA Zoo

That it's ooh, it's the LA Zoo
We funk with the flow and let niggas know that it's

It's the king of the jungle and I can't be tamed
Take you all the way to the millennium brain
It's the return of the yearm, Mr Funky Worm
Heat it like a bottomless kettle, let it burn
Blow my flow you cannot handle
I'm bumpin' and I'm humpin' like a camel on your radio channel
It's me T-H-R-E-A-T
Live for '95 most definitely
In fact, under my styles are low jacked
To stop Petey stole his rhymes from the Zoo tribe jeep
You're dead wrong, unto what tribe they yeb along
So we can know your name when we send ya back home

You made a jam so now the nigga think he Van Damme
You must didn't know I take off like Pan Am
Wreck ya like a pinto, pop the instrumental
And attention ladies and gentlemen
It's the bomb, I did it, I lit it, let em hit it
And it's stronger than the humpty with the chrondo dipped in it
And this is for your midas, just to sink into your fangs
It's the deadly dope man, pumpin' through ya veins
Raised in the Bow 213 area code
Where the criminals dig up your grave lookin' for buried gold
The universe'll soon be mines in due time
You can't tangle with the one from killer Cali's triangle
Deep deep deep down under the dungeon lies your doom
I write the dynamite and watch it TICK! BOOM!
Loony in the tunes be groovin' in your sleep
'Cause in the speakers and technique is way to freakish

[Chorus: x2]

Up above the world so high
Like the stars up in the sky
I'm funky with the flow, understand you
Brown babies from Atlanta just love me like candy
I give the mom a lendin', should've fed me right
Shot to the let 'em wait on the Eastside
I keep my eyes on the sparrow, hos, Afros and arrows
Can't kick it 'cause it's wicked like the Pharaoh
And a walk with the devil is a level far beyond
From de Babylon come many redrum
So follow as we journey through the creepy, sleepy hollow
Take this 40 ounce bottle, see how broke niggas is tomorrow

It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cause I'ma make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea

Wit persistence I perceive
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew

Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal

I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
To get the pooper scooper, why? They dropping doo-doo
I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, 
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?
Major trick we're hitting licks like a doberman gang
Why'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knocking at'cha door
We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses
Knocking niggas like cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting
Busting, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch

Just to let you know when you walk upon a professional microphoner

Transmittin signals through your stereo, thumpin through your speakers

It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people

Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades

No unknown weights to tip the knowledge scales
Eyes dilated to grasp it all

Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt
So vivid, so deprived of hesitation
Shining in its evil splendor

Candy drip off that chrome
(On them things motherfucker)
22 inches on that chrome
(Grippin' grain motherfucker)
They don't leave us alone
(Cocaine motherfucker)

Now let the pain begin, I'm born and bred off in the city of sin
The dirty dime know that, off in Memphis Ten
With my dudes gettin' throwed stuff that white up they nose
Take that kush, break it down, sprinkle meth on the low
With my homies ridin' high with bump in the back
Sometimes my rap with a body, back
Every click in the club, our side ain't jokin'
In the parking lot, I toke we smokin'
And we smash out, dog barkin' under the bumper
Ten cars deep got it sounding like some thunder
Riding 28's, UGK in the back,
And the smoke still blowin' out the barrel of the gat

[Chorus: x2]

First day I got out the slave plantation
My niggas and my bitches gave me a donation
Next day bought a spur, sliver not black
Look at me and that yay in that candy red lac
And all I can remember I was draped in stones
Everyday I drive a Bentley now look at the grows

Bun B the, hopin' out the slab 100 carrot jewelry
Ready to protect it baby strapped up with my toolery
Boys like to play but I ain't with that Tom foolery
I lay 'em down quick, thats just the old school in me
They don't wanna see a nigga go, I might not come back
When I beat 'em down like a Paul and Juicy J track

Its the first of the month, I wanna stunt so playa I'ma kick it
Straight to the car lot this Cadillac I gotta flip it
And I ain't playin' with stress I just unzip and hit it
And I ain't payin' for all the weed nigga we gotta split it
Wanna hood ride then you ridin' with a bounce
I got them suicide doors, 26's on the front
That patron and that goose I drink it from the hip
Cause im always at the bar thats why all my money spent

I'm the trap man, trap man
Lookin' for a girl with fine cap man, cap man
Fallin' in the club you know I'm rollin' I'm rollin'

I'm thinkin' deadly and I'm scopin' with that infarred
Kickin' it with the hardest click
Leavin' bodies rottin' up in them ditches
Man what's done if my tongue hits like a ton of brizicks
Koops not concerned
I let you burn and burn and burn
Everything in the prophecy has been demonically read
So I learned
Deep in the morgue
Lie corps in the quateras
They want to face in a line of order
Can you place this shit
When you crawled up on the red man
You bounce set up in this bitch
Sittin' man and thinkin'
Though my dreams I hear little kids screamin
Poor preachers I waited for hangin'
Which got me like bored in the psycho ward like daily
The 6-6-6 mystery man
Is takin' me straight to insanity
Could it be a dimension of witches that bring out voices
That issue more tragedies
The seas of cries
Will soon be turning
Your fuckin' life over
Left the priest and island bleeding of four leaf clover
Then I crinkle enough of these slugs
?? I'd rather be mugged to drink up a pint of his blood

Cut through my bloodstream
You hoes ass niggas better kill me
'Cause fool this ain't no dream

And throw her in a sewer

When I got something to do with it

Now we got some killas in the house
When you claim you couldn't tell
Do I need to leave it here?

To leave your ass convinced
Or do we need to put some kick dose on you fucky hoes
Mack 10's and 12's rebel
WE got this under control

And when we call this type of deal
It's a splash party
When them brains paint the wall

Watch me grasp for this stash
Rip off this mask

6 in tha mornin' police kick in my door
Slipped on my lugz
'cause these thugs out the back yo
Jumped the back gate
Cranked the Chevy
Then I race
Popped in the tape
A motherfuckin' Three 6 Mafia tape
I'm crunked off the bump
Pumpin' through my backseat
Speedin' hit the weed
Though the end of the streets of Memphis, Tennesee
Got my stacks and some bags sittin' in the stash spot
Tatooes on my legs and a hot 40 glock
They got the hard on for the Infamous nigga
Call me Scarecrow
Used slangin' man, but I don't do that no more
I'm feelin' like I'm the most wanted
Every cop is an opponent
In the dash
On my ass, on the cherry buck flash
And I'm real
Man I got to get the fuck out of here

I had to ditch the Chevy
Callin' my mafia niggas to scooped me up
The blocks are crawlin' with cops
I can't go down, them slugs bust
I'm runnin' through yards and shit
Tryin' to dodge them tricks
I'm a movin' target
I spotted my nigga out there
On the real, gonna rde with out no fly shit
He didn't hesistate, we climbed up out my side of town
I told him bout' the drama in the ride and how it went down
I got a lay low cool (??) before I get back in it
Anti-peace and po-police
I beat them with glocks back to the street
I can't get caught, cause the new law say in it ""ain't no deals""
I would decease these devil police, therefore I do twenty years
Every nigga and grill they drop a dime to papers
I gotta pull a quick capa before I catch the vapors

12 a-m the next day
Gotta bank the seas
Gotta preacher please (??) throw in the keys
Down to my nigga
Got the passport to get my overseas
Under the palm trees
But you know me a quarter key
But my pan was injured
The silent alarm was triggered
I heard a cop say come out with fuckin' hands up
Nigga now I got to show my Prophet (??)
My only way out was to take me some hostages
They keep askin' me over and over for demands
I told them back up
Or she got brains on her pants
The gun was to her head, I told them don't make me shoot
But little did I know they had a sniper on the roof

One cold winter of many tales
Trails of blood left in frozen snow
A family slaughtered by a loved one, forgive scarecrow
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts
Found staked on the floor soaked in evidence of the root of violence
Only a teen, sent to spend my final life in an insane asylum
So furious of  past, I'm an adult I feel better now
But no matter, I tell them that I know  they'll never let me out
I rot in this dread, my only world's the one in my head
I hate psycho-therapists, I walk amongst walking dead
Everday, yes every-single day, peepin' ways to escape
I got to find a way out this place, it's a must, got to find a way
I'm pullin hair up out my freakin' head yo
They trippin' cause a nigga  put his ass in a choke hold
I want to go psycho and kick this mutha fuckin' force boi   
In a padded room I know I'll never get up out this hole
I'm pacin' back and forth across this room
I gotta think of somethin, man I got to make a move
The day I killed my fuckin' family in a week or two
I got to get up  back out there I want to do it again fool
Gettin' cool with the old ass maintence man
I told him ""If you help me out I'd put a lotta papes in your hand
I stashed a lotta dough in dirt before a nigga left it
If you help me out when I get out I'll give you half on that deal""
The old man ready, he grinnin', that stray
Look here gramps, meet me at my door for the plan round 'bout 8
Check it pops, you got to get a shovel and a pine box 
Put me in the ground and dig me out once they talk to the cops
I'm gonna need a slight overdose of some mother fuckin' sleepin' pills 
So while I'm waitin in the dirt I won't breathe up  the air in here
Sneak in the office get the keys off of Dr. Malique
And while you doin that I'll take the pills so I fall asleep
I started feelin' my awareness fadin' away
I could slightly hear all the dirt gettin' tossed on to the pine crate
I awoke and in my square waiting to be freed
But from the light I seen
someone killed the maintenance man and threw him in with me

I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?
I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?",Anyone Out There,1997

Sweep and let the blast take you from off your feet
And to your family and your friends I know them hoes will miss you
You should have warned them that the Three 6 Mafia out to get cha
Would you walk to his house with a pistol
Could you let the heat go like you shouldn't have missed him

Droppin' on the curve to by to my (??)

The rowdy gunclaps the bloody gunclaps

(Juicy J)
5 A-M in the mornin'
Nigga heard them tones pumpin' like a thousand-five cannons
Nigga gettin' it on
Peep out the window, I was solo flashin'in the streets
Caught by cops
I'm tell them bring some extra tape and plenty sheets
Right they ass chevy drove by bout' seventy shotguns
Loaded for your roller
Put em' straight to sleep
Hollow points hit my fuckin' window
Make you think your through
Like it's the forth of July
With them niggas spook
I wish the folks would hurry up
I cock my gun back with my thumb
Nigga rowdy rowdy like it's North Memphis, Vietnam
As I gotta check to take a look and then fired back
I realized I was out numbered
In a deadly trap

(Scarecrow)
Three 6 Mafia, Prophet Posse, Killa Kaze

Leave your chest cavity
Stoppin' at the autopsy

And I can't help but notice all your pain
When the monsters got that Clappin', Clappin', Clappin'
On them thangs man
We hear the gunshots
Nigga bang diggy dank
Got a shank full of thangs
And it is kind of insane
I Scarecrow with mystical styles
Niggas are getting buck wild
Look at my dirty fouls
Bodies are stacked up by pounds
You want to fuck with me player

And hoes that know we can't be even Steven
Should not believe in
Too late one of them slip it's my foes
You already got my glock to the back of your head
Prayers already said
Done consider yourself dead
Your family and friends might be sayin' that I crossed you out
But nigga you was fake from the beginning
So I had to toss you out
Friend I'm no more
I kill all you foes
Step in my trunk
And I give it to a stroll back
The hammer release
And leave your chest with holes
All in the club 
With that buck ass tube and pot
It's kind of hard
you can't beat us
And you can't join us
Cause we ain't gonna stop if you don't stop

(Scarecrow)
Some of the superior astronomical bends
From that of my mystical dreams
Of the many scenes
Mighty, manipulative, mercilous, multiple murderers
Sit back in dangerous
Hittin' and strippin'
And critical injury
Misery, seriously witness to the tremory
Trajedy, agany, infamy, agany brutal mentality
Assassatain
My voodoo tribe 
If you don't want to be fried
Put on a feary disguise
Lord Infamous takn' no prisoners
Forget the begging, pleading, and the cries 
Your reservation revalation
A satanic nation
Has be prophesized
I can look in your eyes and tell that there is fear
From the eternal burning of each of your lies
Flights of headlights
Black clothes and limos
Another negro startin' to decompose
From his casket the Scarecrow shall place a bloody black rose
Who knows that hate 
That goes behind closed doors
With corpses froze in six foot holes
Wicked throws
Evil flows and torturing of foes

Chorus x4

Yeah, I ain't ya fuckin' friend
You do your ass in nigga
(Laughter)
Three 6 mafia comin' at your ass for the 9-7 bitch
Yeah
Watch your back niggas
You know who you are motherfucker
That brown shit would (???)

Gotta have a lady that want to do what I do

Fillin' a lazy on top and a Bud Light
Just for your freaks on a moon like tonight

Tell me three 6 whose that bumpin' that music
Hypnotizin' Koop, I tell you who, I'm 'bout to lose it
Could it be that late night crew tight
Just inside the party
Always kind of lonely
Someone want me, hold me, I say

We come to far to turn back now, I hope we make it
But everytime them prophets fly, I'm motivated

Back in the days
I used to get down
Pockets on e
I can't do nothin' but frown
Feelin' my belly and don't come around
Had to be pushin' that bope by the pound
Go with da folk that be pullin' a bitch
Not to popular now you know you're the shit
Fuckin' with reala
That know you're legit
Pushin' that shit that you shoot in your wrist
had ot be down about makin' my grip
Pumpin' the beat
Hopin' the needle won't skip
Nukin' a dinner while flippin' the script
Niggas still trippin' still runnin' they lip
Now they just comin' in larger amounts
Then I stack them in my bank account
This is for half of your ass watch it bounce
Motivation for my power and clout

20 years old
Ridin' in a 80,000 dollar viper
Better watch out for the snipers
They be bumpin' our tapes
But they really don't like us
Why must some local bustas try to dis me
When they don't even know me
Not knowin' i'll run up on they ass
With a motherfuckin' mac
Kill em' all off slowly
I'm tryin' to keep my cool, keep my cool
Cause I got plenty to lose

I quickly erase all you hoes that be playa hatin'

But I'm gon' stay motivated
This crazy lady
Don't give a fuck bout' what you say
It don't mean shit
Maybe cause I'm stackin' cheese
And you ain't stackin' nothin' but dicks
Including you niggas too
You be ridin' on dicks 
I know you do
I'm stayin' on top of my game
I'll be number one so nigga fuck you

(Scarecrow)
This music game is gonna drive me insane
It's all about figures
Cause when you're dealin' with heavy stakes
Somethin' gon' brake or get injured
Niggas talkin' bout' paying dues
I got the bruises to prove it
Did everything a nigga could do
To make it in the game of rap music
But still everytime I try to make a move some mothefuckers always 
	gotta doubt
And then them very same niggas don't know what the fuck they talkin' 
	bout'
Keepin' the faith up on my plate
Was the reflection of my face
Sayin' it to make it but still gave the good Lord his grace

With two some on shakes
No rubber with a paratroop
In fields with parachutes
Down to the blue
No matter however, can't hold em' for forever
Dead or alive, with your body, I sprinkle rotten flower pedals
Yes the consequences, are your choice, my dred
Cause Lord Infamous will gain
A healthy bounty for your head

(DJ Paul)
I'm wakin' up
Tossin' and turnin'
Like in a scuffle
My words aren't clear, rarely I speak, speak
My voice is muffled, muffled
My hands over my face
They done got me
I'm startin' to feel woozy
They done shot me
The same fools I done creeped on, in his own sleep, sleep
One them hoes survived
Now they creeped on me

(Crunchy Blac)
Fool we got your ass now
So what's up
Isn't you quiet, just because we got your ass muff
Muffled like bag your mouth
Shouldn't of ran your mouth
Talkin' about you gonna creep
While we was sleep, but it was just no doubt

(Scarecrow)
Now the tables have turned
And in the mist of the morgue
Your funky sould burn nigga

Chorus x2

(Gangsta Boo)
Ten times out of twelve
nine times out of ten
Gansta Boo is in it to win
Prophet rider till the end
Smokin' weed
Gettin' twisted more and sippin' havin' thoughts
Thoughts about a nigga
I remember what that trick had bought
Kept that visine in my purse
Get a rental car from Hertz
Call my niggas from the Three 6, tell em' about the plan first
Ooh weeee
Can it be, another song we done made
Fakin' on no damn jacks 
A bitch gots to get paid
Come on prophets, now it's on
Nigga, It's like that home alone
Like white boy fuckin'
Lets go get this bitch
Man nigga gone, done deal stupid trick
Now you know this lady bitch
Swing go gets high
Scott free with your shit

(Juicy J)
For all the dirt
That I did to my wife
Forgive me lord
Each and every night
Croked cops
Pull a gun don't fight
Blow you away, leave you out of sight
Search a nigga from the shirt to pants
Nothin' on me
But a sack ass can
Cannon I, With empty shots
Bucket clean
They find a couple of grams
Tons of dope
That that nigga don't know
The Juice man
Can't be cuttin' no bro
Tryed the cuffs
But the nigga didn't go
Broke his throat
With a quick left blow
Now it's on, and the chase begins
Cuttin the corner, shirt blowin' in the wind
Dog on my trail
And he pickin' up the scent
K-0 cops
Kill a four legged friend
Jump in the lex
Voodoo like a hex
Dog confused, in they mind complex
Fuck the red light, ballin' on my set
Cops on my trail, cause I let you rest
Hop in the car, ran two more blocks
Put in reverse, then I heard the gun shots
Doin' a hundred, so I couldn't get popped
Officer friendly, on the trip nonstop

If you real and you know it then mayn
Toss a bitch
To a real tight playa

Boots what I'm pockin'
Robers are watchin'
Nine milaluga mayn
That's what I'm pockin'

Pop brand new tags off the brand new clothes
Brush my hair back, and kick the ho out the door
Flip a quarter to see which ride I'm pullin' out the garage
Wireless transmitters send bump to my barb
Pull a pack out, and fill my body up wit' sin

Dro puffer, cheese come up, when we on the track jack
Hit you in the head, with the gat, 'til your skull crack
Blood gushin', head rushin', act first, no discussion
Come with that bullshit, then the bullets start bustin'

First crime, we came with Mystic Stylez on grime
You slip, I live by my rep don't fuck with mine
Da end, the souls of men embedded inside the posse
The prophet, the posse, we all collide

We brutal, the vhapter two to end the phase, our mind
In crime, reminds, CrazedNLazDayz
Heypno-tize, and blazed another gold plate
Sixty six, sixty one, the smoke clears, evaporate

I got a 357, a tec with a black clip
A hundred and eighty pounds witha fist that will bust lips
Some killaz on my side, if I tell 'em they gon' get
A fiend wiolatin' the business, I ain't wit'

And now in 2000 you talkin' the same shit
And now in 2000 I'll bust and I won't miss
They smoke is in the air the liquor is still a fill
The grill is still gold, and the curls they know kick doors

First one of us is done, hollow tips come by the ton
Two AK's, and put some drama to leave this niggaz bodies numb
I don't talk this shit for fun, cock it back and let it go
And six shots, from the 3-6 shooters lettin' 'em know, whoa!

Picture me, naked face, to kickin' in your door
Four, niggaz deep, bandanas with black calicos
So, when we creep, drop cause I'ma hit you nine times
Take your nine lives, bump up and Hypnotize your mind, blow

You can believe this, you can believe that
And believe I got a baseball bat, and I'm bustin' your head black
You believe I'm comin' strong, you believe I'm all grown
You believe, that nigga, I love to get it on

You half steppin'
I got the weapon
Boom! Boom! I'm blastin' at your mind to get you believe that
I love to kill, I love the thrill
And I love to put a nigga body parts in the field, nigga

No no, come, come and get this bitch, ain't got no time fo no shit
Got all my boys, don't make no noise, 
Just throw that trick in the ditch
It ain't no way La Chat gon' let it slide, with the shit that you done

I got my piece for what I do, to show you who the fuck number one
I shot that bitch without causes, ain't got no love in my heart
It ain't no way that I can't handle, keep that tone in my jaw
This ain't no crap, I speak the truth, gotta come too thick to get me
On one of you hoes, before you come, La Chat ain't gone easy

Man a bitch'll take that lil bit out her pussy for them papers
Get the fuck away from me ho because the crew can't stand them vapors
Take her, break her, to whip that funky bitch
Talkin' that shit about this 

Man you'll get ten slugs up in your arm pits
Yeah we can do I,t take your time and do it right
You can gimme the fuckin' chewin', I can fuck you all night
Want to fight about your friends see how them bitches gon' start
See now that's that type of shit that get my muh'fuckin' dick hard

Capital Mack-11's, and load 'em full of ammunition
Terrorist sect's, we pull and lock'em in the Expedition
No set a niggaz got guns equivalent to what we pack
Nuclear pistols and fire scorchin' automatic gats

How in the fuck can you handle the, butsa damager
Toss that bitch over the banaster, like trash canisters
Hollow points into your battle troops, when I have to shoot
Plus I'll be storin' the cap for you, and trick be absolute

I woke up early Saturday morning, 
Suddenly your phone was ringin' off the charger
Thinkin' to myself, man, is it a bitch or cop, or is it them robbers
Got MC Mack of in a scheme, I'm stainin' for my dividends

And pay a livin', neh nigga, 
Gon' bother my cheese gon' reach the ceilling fan
You can catch my in that president thing, on gizold when you see me
You can joke me, ever rope me, best believe your bleed this evenin'

Fuck the reason, and the treason, 
Time to get dirty nigga better I'll pop it
You was gaspin' for your life, but all I heard was Killa Klan Kaze

Bitches think we playin', think this killa shit a joke
Don't fuck around with HCP and get you ass smoked, ho
Comin' with some fully auto's, fuck some semi's
Hit 'em with some hollow auto's, 'cause I despise

Blastin' like some rondo batays, for you miatays
Koop with double clicks and duck tape, and wicked wizays
And I, perferin' keepin' busin' in my freak time
Taught 'em in that buried unknown, they want to reap why

Give you second thoughts about that businness, you then finished right
Take you to the vault, cash it in, all night flight
And I'm in a bad mood, cocaine make it that
Plus, I gotta ease on this nine-milly, willy, nigga I slang with that

If you bitches ain't scared put a bitch right to the floor

You ain't buck 'cause bitch I saw ya stankin' ass yesterday
Talk ya ? hoe ya ? 'cause I'm comin' in the crowd boy
With niggas and I'm out slammin' bitches to the ground

I see ya from the stage ya angry face is fighting in the corner
Full of marijuana niggas in the middle in a trauma
While they throwin' 'bo's they snatchin' hoes that stuck in a coma
Any thick lil' fine bitch come on through a nigga all up on her
Some trick done got mad and ran to the wagon and grabbed a 12 gauge pump
Probably full of that numby numb that coke and rum and getting dumb
Cars are barrelin' through the nigga shootin' runnin to the Rover
Niggas catchin' the heat from slugs
Negroes gettin' trampled over

Platinum out and on the spot
Mad because they take your cell
So they stop at slangin' rocks
Bring yo ass to North Memphis

Playas on them cards flippin'
Choppin' dope up in the kitchen
And I always keep it real
Way before a record deal
So my nigga don't hate on me 'cause Juicy J be gettin' his bills
Clean that mug from off ya face unless you want a casket case
Nigga fuck what you end, who you clean, and fuck ya friend

Nigga you claimin' set, throwin', showin' signs
You ain't no one look inside your face is plain as day 
Another hoe is showin'
Bitch I'm down with the same game you claim but I will fuck you up
Hoe it ain't the same off in them flames I don't give a fuck
Put some in your liver you so ? in the studio
Nigga all but the liver watch you run like bitch was stealers that I let you

Packing automatics full of that static that you stressin' for
Actin' like you want some but it seems you scared to go

Hey don't call me for sweet songs
Ain't no ?
Ain't no funky smilin' faces
Ain't no grins up on this man
It's the ? that keeps me cool
Social security breaking news
Shit could fight up all night with mo Henny wait that's how I (breath)
Do you feel it? Is it rare?
Smack that bitch up with that chair
When you see me over there
Raise your hands up in the air
'Cause bitch this ain't no Rosewood
Nigga take another round
Slipped up, chopped up, fucked, lights out

Claim where I claim, hang where I hang
Burn where I burn, nigga ain't no thing
Do what I do, hanging with my crew
(What, what, what, what) nigga I thought you knew
Ain't no hood, throwin' our sets

I never ran up to a trunk
Blastin on a fuckin punk
Toxicated, high, or drunk
Try and grab the closest pump
Never flodged on 
how I lived
Fight a nigga over a bitch
Playa Im just callin pimp
Always keep a cigarette lit
Never walked up in the club
Dissin niggas wit a mug
Always keep my own sacks
Never wanted to hit your bud
Independent on you hoes
Makin more than selling dope
If you wanna hate the click
Nigga I make your body froze
[Serv-on]
Close yo eyes when ya see tha gat shots in my plaster
Mouth full its a south thang thuggin like that
You say you know Im in North Memphis pushin that drill
Tearin clubs up in South Memphis and Smokey that slip
Say your prayers when I lay that iron clean on yo chest
Dont play no games boy, Im kinda wild wit them techs
Pretend you deaf when I scream what city you claim
Fuck around wit me I separate your body from your name
[La Chat]
Lay down bitch ,La Chat and I ain't playing no games buckin you hoes, my mado

Now how you figure when you fuck up that we gone let you live
We kill your ass then set a ransom fo your guts that we spill!!!!!

Tell yo boyfriend cut the crap-and, heard he got that fire ass capp-and

When I slam cadillac do's, 17 inch vogues
On the curb, sip and serve, ask a broad ""what's the word?""
Wrong answer mean as cancer when I'm on that fuckin bird
Runny nose and roastin hoes, kickin in them hotel do's
Gotta keep that paper right, up all night and hype off white
Big Bizness, Bizness Big when you talkin bout pimpin trick
Gotta keep an eye out for them bitches tryna pimp ya dig?
In the 2 thou, manne that shit done got so popular
Push a pimp like me way back like some backwards binoculars
But real pimps gon stay afloat like rubber ducks in white folks tubs
Clouds creepin up above, smoke burnin from this bud

If I know you then I front ya (proper)
But you gotta break me off
You don't, I catch ya slippin' on the block and knock you off
I know people, I get nice deals
Get 'em $5 sell 'em $10 a pill
I know people, big ki's for 13
If I fuck witcha, ya get 'em for 16
I know people, get 'em 300 a pound
Give 'em to ya for 500 if you my round
I'ma hustler, holla at me Uptown
I'm well connected with weed, white, slangin' that brown
Come see a nigga want a nice 60
You real we swap work you fake its 20 g's
It's like that, I done been through the struggle
I'm runnin' Choppa City an fuckin' with Grand Hustle

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there
Or you can hear it from these niggas who was hardly there
Or take it from niggas who fought to make it a star to get here
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shutin' down when the don appear

With my nigga Big Hamp, and the nigga pass me a blunt man
Like smoke this shit nigga this some Bin Laden weed
Y'all don't know nothing bout this down South
So I was like, what, what the fuck is Bin Laden weed?
Man he said that shit is like three different kinds of weed grown all together
He said that shit some straight killer
Them Chicago niggas name that shit Bin Laden weed man, some straight fie!

I swear sometimes I got to get high to hang around my hoe
Sometimes I feel like I got to get high to hang round niggas I know
I sped it up on weed I slowed it down on snow
'Cause I seen so many niggas fall off that blow
One day they got it all and ain't got shit to show
So I came to my natures I had to cut that hoe
So know I'm feeling happy I'm on that binny Bin Laden
And niggas is acting like they don't know what the fuck just happened
My vision getting blurry I'm about to fall asleep
Or am I dying of OD 'cause this some potent weed
My life start flashing like holograms like right in front
Of my own face I never felt this way on one blunt
I see my son gaining life and my dad losing his
And old girlfriends and niggas I shouldn't hung with
The picture starting to fade it's getting hard to breathe
I'm blacking out with no post up under my shirt and sleeve

Well since I'm on Bin Laden let me tell you a story
'Bout these three pussy rappers who couldn't do nothing for me
Gave a whole lot of cheese said I fucked him his shit
Smoked a whole lot of weed so he seem to forget
Who bought trunks and you cars gave you bitches and hoes
Who told you ass to take a bath when you thought you was raw
Man I tell you he a killer when we talk on the phone
When you see him face to face he'll leave you alone
That's why I'm smoking on this fucking Bin Laden
All my niggas in the hood they got it
Take one little puff you a addict
Take a gun to the head means tragic
Boy I tell you like this we can smoke it anywhere
In front of police station with a six pack of beer
Seven a.m. in the morning just watching people stare
Let 'em point them damn fingers say they wild over there

Ay, ay it's glowing like it's indigo I smell it through the bag
I'm floating like a magic carpet straight from Baghdad
From my brains from my blood from my lungs from the duchess
Can't just let this reefer just escape from my a clutches
'Cause it's the substance I'm loving I'm buzzing
Smoking like a narven huffing and puffing
Came from the Indonesia, Colombian or kaliman
Or it's by the welfare straight from the Taliban

Do you remember me from smoking good weed
Break it down roll it up give it the indo need
Do you remember me from no sticks no seeds
Or you remember me from putting you on this Laden weed
Get yo funds together and come go and see
I'm gone take you on the strip where Bin Laden be
This one blunt action you'll have to smoke and see
Have you choking, falling out with your family

Who we got in here?
Juicy J, Lil Wyte, Frayser Boy, Crunchy Black
Lord Infamous and me, DJ Paul the King of Memphis

Nigga we some maniacs, fuckin' up our brainiacs

Crop a mix with Smilax, take a gun and cock it back
Now I'm 'bout to blow my brains out 'cause I don't give a shit
Hope you give a nigga reason to want ya, the bigger gun the better
The more shit you talk, the more blood the sweata'
The plane crashes, the Devil, the anthrax, the letters
Forgot about the peddlers, we still in it together

Let me introduce myself, my fuckin' nigga
I'ma be the one to pull that fuckin' trigga
I'ma be the one that's sent to fuckin' getcha
You better watch out 'cause I'll paint a picture
A pretty little picture, now how a nigga getcha
Lock you in the trunk and take care of my business

I am the predator you are the prey
You play the target, Lord play the gage
You play bitches and I mack hoes
You run from niggaz, I find the snub nose

And you can't sell three copies of your shit
You smoke garbage weed, and cheap packs a blow
You own a vehicle, pick up the Scarecrow

Frayser Boy, cockin' toy, ya'll don't wanna fuck with me
Infared got ya scared in protective custody
The Unbreakables, the most hateable, the unescapeables
Time to bust a nigga head, we aren't hesitateable
Ya chest pumped out, mouth talkin' that shit
I'm from the Bay, I'ma show you how a nigga beat a bitch
Time to damage shit, no understandin' this, you know you scandalous
HCP blowin' your lights out like a candle, bitch

Well I'm about to rich rip a hole in the industry, holdin' my energy
Wasn't about to let it, but you had to come testin' me
Givin you one warning change your name before I get your crunk
Lyrically copyrighted all my shit, and plus I'll fuck you up
You don,t want to have to cross the path a killers when you on the streets
HCP got WYT to the E and that's just how it be
Quit ya muthafuckin' hatin' playin' all your petty games
If you wanted to ride my nuts that bad you should've asked me man

Danger, you muthafuckas wanted a war bitch, then I'ma bring it on
Catch you in these fuckin' streets, boy and I'ma point the chrome
Put you in the fuckin' car, hoe, and we gon' take you home
To hell with all that cryin' now, nigga we gonna get it on
Beat you with that yawk, dead center across your damn dome
The way you ran your mouth, you should've known to have the fuckin' tone
Beggin' from beginning, man winnin' 'cause our camp is strong
The same way your skull started dentin 'cause we beat it long you niggaz

Swear you have the right plan but you had the wrong mans
Tryin to build a clique like the hypnotize camp
I'm knowin' it wouldn't work so I just sit back
And watch how the trains just runs off the track
'Cause it be to many loses, to many bosses
Too many niggaz that's wantin' they own office
You niggaz gotta realize who got the city owned

I love a ghetto ass chick, break down rings for me
If I would let her shoot, she'll count up this cheese for me
It's going down like I knew it would
We gon' keep on makin money cause this honey is good

I need a down ass chick, that'll roll wit the clique
For the dope sale, bank robbin, cock it back and buck up on a bitch
Kidnap vamp, leave a busters body, in a ditch
Take the charge for you, always drinking liquor

Stayin' lit, when we in the bed, baby girl can ride
Like a champ, give a playa head, lickin on my thang
Like a stamp, if I had that I wouldn't trade anything
For her she my main girl, main dog, that's my name, Paul

[DJ Paul]
Now I can't say that I love her, but I got some love for her
She showed me, she was bout a haul before I really knowed her
I schooled her bout them glocks, I schooled her bout them rocks
I told her how to hold a spot when I was off the block

She kept it hot, as soon as I stepped in the house she had my money spot
Plus a dro blunt rolled up with a syrup lollipop
The hood tried to holler everyday but it ain't nothin
She down with the King but I still love a ghetto ass chick

[Chorus]

This one here for the old lady but not dissin this time
This for when you took the charge when I committed the crime
I was out there super high playin mister crash dummy
You put up all my money, didn't take nothing from me

Always found your boy a lawyer when I caught me a case
Paid all my fines and kept up with my court dates
And even though I gave you hell with all these other lil broads
You always came and made my bail when I broke the law

The only one that's reliable the one that's dependable
Keep you by my side these other fools is suspendable
I ain't forgot when I was out there hurt for some cash
You never mind takin your last, on out the stash

Always tried to give me the last up out your purse
Always tried to get my ass to go on and go to church
I couldnt pay you back even if I had to
Hard on these fools but I'll never be to hard on you

Since I made me some money (You believe it)
It wasn't no problem when I gave it to you (I know)
But since I quit I'm in the wrong to you (That's low)

It ain't my fault that I kept chasin' my dreams
You claimed you couldn't see the woods, because of too many trees (You dummy)
And despite impossibilities (You know)
I turned to all impossibilities (For sure)

Don't make a nigga run up and shank ya

Throw tile over round your throat and drag ya 'cause
Get nothing from me, but gangsta love
No testin' me my nigga, have you laying in blood
Or dig you a grave, cut ya bitch ass up

Hollow tip bullets don't die, nigga they multiply

Yo, Right now we gonna dedicate this to all our soldiers,

And all our ones that still runs with they guns,
In the field you know what I'm sayin?
This dedicated to ya'll man,
Hold it down,

[Verse 1-DJ Paul:]
Now as I run through tha trees with my infiltry
I got my M16 and my artilary
I got my full blooded soldiers in tha back of me
And a bullet proof vest and I'm hopin I don't have to see
now will it work in tha line of fire
Or will a nigga die in tha line of fire
I'ma bust my gunz till my clips retire
America pray 'cause I don't want to expire

Playin around with them army toys

Put 'em in a battle and we'll showed you boys
That army fatigue we gonna make some noise
And blow that mother fucker from shore to shore

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3-Lil Wyte:]
With bullets wizzin by, children dyin every 36 seconds
It makes it uncomfortable for me to even respect this
With this focused brain I can take myself away from pain
Turn me into rain, sprinkle it upon all of us in vein
I'm the one that was sent to make sure the sun will always shine
Try to determin the evil and good all in my twisted mind
Hopefully, this just might be the one that reaches to the world
And make a safer place to play for all our little boys and girls
'cause I'm a soldier don't get it twisted
Get your wig split
Fifty millimeter shells aiming for the terrorist
Must have missed 'cause they still comin with some big shit
Osama fucked up real deep and there ain't no time to fix it
He better be off the planet, two light years passed the moon
Rode on a magic carpet satellites gonna find him soon
He's probably already dead fuckin with tha U.S.A
But if not he better not bring his ass up in tha bay

[Juicy J:]
Let me hear tha sound of tha soldiers
I said let me hear tha sound of tha soldiers
Juicy J tha soldier boy
The marines ain't no punk and you know we keep grenades and AK's in the trunk
With Iraq we be buck, we be fightin and we stomp
With our fist, with our feet, we be ready when you jump
We don't hide behind mask like a terrorist my nigg
Just so you know who tha real fuckin cowards is.

They was in a Regal I was in a Monte Carlo
Pissin' on they CDs thought they really wanted beef
Now they back there bleedin' from they head to they stanky feet believe it

Playa pass me the green I'mma smoke it like a fiend
And I'm bout to pour some purple syrup and sip up on some lean
But it's cool if you niggaz wanna take the weed and roll it
If you wanna buy the syrup and then pour it

Don't be stingy wit the shit because I'm so legit
Ain't the type to take the weed and then hold it
Juicy J the type to lick a blunt and fold it
You can come by my crib and get so lit

But they ain't tell me I can't start another fight no more
I get it crunk in the club, niggaz get drunk in the club
When I perform me a hoe, niggaz get jumped in the club
But I'm used to that shit, so it ain't no need to run
And just because you gotta gun don't mean that's the only one
So if you came here to chill nigga, just chill and shit
'cause you ain't gotta act like that I know you feelin' this shit
I bet, I bet I could hit with Juicy, Paul and Banner
I gotta holla at peaches, when I hit Atlanta

Either you won't but nigga you will
All these stories you makin up killin my ill
And my patience ain't long at all
Nigga don't fuck wit me if I ain't fuckin wit y'all
'cause I'm ready for the world but is it ready for me
What you see on TV is on these streets
Some of these niggaz ain't as hard as they say they is
And niggaz don't live like they sayin they is
They wanna roll wit thug niggaz and gangstaz
But real ass niggaz don't roll wit wankstaz

(Move your body don't stop don't miss)

Man she got me in the zone when I watch this broad pass by
Been becking at this bitch all night but this my last try
I am trying to see what's up, you know a nigga trying to fuck
If you are a girlie girl then I'll settle for a suck

You got a thug on the scene in the club on some green
A nigga ain't Ginuwine but trying to get up in them jeans
Frayser Boy that's the name, fuck another I'm the man
Get you drank after drank get you drunk I'm trying to bang

Where ya at whoa, where ya at whoa
CB wanna hit you from the back whoa
And when I grab your girl, don't holla, let go
'Cause I like a girl with a big back bro

I mean she stacked low and when I jacked yo
I shoot that thang like I'm shooting off a Mac whoa
It ain't no game I play when it come to D
And if you get it from me then you getting dope D'd

We looking for them J-Lo booties, big ol' ass, round and fat
Let me squeeze it, let me squeeze it
When she take it to the floor, I want to hit it from the back

Juicy J is pimpy not always all friendly
I wanna get that chewin' like from Monica Lewinsky

(Papi)
Hanging low and

Big ol' J-Lo booty, what a wedding, good, she sized or

Bring it up

Make it jiggle, make it clap

Let me squeeze it ain't no teasing
Go to get it, I done seen it
Soon as she drop it on the floor
It's over for this one this evening, I might leave it

Sticky drippin' up out of the side of her secret
Victoria probably gone be pissed when ever she sees it
But once you got me going it's on
Ain't no reason for you be wanting to go home

You gotta give it to me nice and round that big J-Lo booty
I need it badly
I'll be happy
Drop it off she a cutie

We looking for them J-Lo booties, big ol' ass, round and fat
Let me squeeze it, let me squeeze it
When she take it to the floor, I want to hit it from the back
Let me squeeze it, let me squeeze it

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm looking for them J-Lo booties
But I ain't Ben Affleck and I ain't Diddy
And I ain't the dude who taught her to dance like that
I'm just a dirty, dirty, down south gold mouth nigga
Can't remember the last time I only saw six figures

I bang a bad big booty thang daily
I did more stars than that boy Carson Daily
And if you nice you ain't even gotta pay me
But if you ugly hit the bank and try to save me

I know this broad
She lick the Infamous so good she make me wanna cry
And if she wasn't such a dog I'd hit her doggy every night
They put the 'free' in freak, they put the 'ut' in slut
They put the 'amp' in tramp and catch you when I take off the glove

She give brain insane, I call the dame a brainiac
Let me meet the family, all the women nymphomaniacs
She got the biggest brown round that you ever seen
Lord, the maniac I make her hit the club and make that cheese

",Yeah I Rob,2005
Three 6 Mafia,"I only fuck wit those, who only fuck wit me

A sucka' play for games, a man play for keeps

I keeps me a nine millimeter just in case

A coward's in my face

These bullets he gon taste


A waste of your life, steppin' wrong, I'm on trees

Best ta leave me alone, best ta go make some cheese

Enemies come in all shapes, forms, sizes, colors

Could be your best friend, cousin, or brothers


I'll rob'em all, just to see who got the fatty stack

Walked in the bank, put the loot in the codauh sack

Slapped on the guard four times fo' he passed out

Eyes on that blow and my pockets was assed out

Had on a trench coat, wig and some goggles

If'n you resist, you may not see tomorrow

I'm in there, I den dared the police couldn't get me

But I made a slip up: had a trick wit me.


Chorus X2:


Don't turn around (Give me the fuckin' cheese trick)

Don't make a sound (Show me where them keys at)

Lay it on the ground (knowing that your pockets fat)

Fore' I buck you down (and I'm quicks' to do that)


Nigga starting braggin' in his hood bout the robbery

Wasn't long then, fore' somebody dropped the dime on me

I'm'a be the one they can't get to, they picked the boy up

Run his mouth just like a fool, he gon' get me fucked up

But, I'm'a have to get to him before the police do-a

Caught up with him night and day, not him and his crew-a

Sprang down Chelsie Ave. kinda in the evening

For this muhfuckas death, dawg I was fiend'n

He was looking at me strange, like I'm'a catcha

I done hopped out with the thang, lemme holla at'cha,

Foo, where you been dog? (My momma got sick, main!)

Fuck that got to do wit'chu? (Hold up I ain't your bitch, main!)

I heard you been talking your muh-fuckin' lips loose (Nah, it ain't like that dawg, I ain't no damn fool)

Looking in his eyes, I could see that he was so scared

I squeezed on the trigga with the gun to his fo'-head.


(Chorus x2)


Blew the top out his skull, now they want me dead

All the niggas in his hood, police and the feds

Stepped out of Westwood, way out of the side

On the other side of town, somewhere I can hide

I done threw my life away, hunted by them by pigs

Robbing every other day, drops in off my nig

They done found my whereabouts, bouts' to do me in

Kickin' in the front door, and I was in the den

SK was under the couch, snatch it off the wham

Open fire on them hoes, I didn't give a damn

Blood stream was full of dope, pump off coca leaf

Feds had me under a scope, and an infrared beam

Rifle bullet threw my throat, chokin', hit tha flo'

Gunpowder in my mouth, knockin' heavens door

Street life done took me out, and that shit ain't fake

I done fuck myself off, cause a bad mistake

A blow song, a 'Surp' song
Like wrapped all in to one ma'fuckin song
Shit I mean you could play this shit at a weddin'

Play this shit at a barbeque
You could play this shit at a restaurant
At a fuckin' school
I mean this is the song of all songs

Let me hit that nigga, let me hit that weed
Let me sniff that nigga, let me sniff that P
Let me sip that nigga, let me sip that lean
'Cause I'm a fiend nigga fuck with me

Let me hit that nigga, let me hit that weed
Let me sniff that nigga, let me sniff that P

And if you got it than you got me man
I promised my smokin' is out of the frame
And I ain't gon' even try to play ya man

Can ya let me get some weed see my check ain't came?
And a nigga like me I ain't playin' games
I need that Mary Jane, I need that Mary Jane
Like a junkie need crack run through the veins

See niggas takin' pills, I mean they poppin' 'em man
But can y'all niggas code name some names
Who holla perkacin' we holla X man?
I pop a full bottle now I'm outta the frame

See if you got sales then you got game
Now all you need now is a freaky lil' thang
To get on her knees and bless ya thang

Let me sniff that nigga, let me sniff that P

Let me sniff that nigga, let me sniff that P
Let me sip that nigga, let me sip that lean
'Cause I'm a fiend nigga fuck with me

I swear gettin' high in the '05 is too high
And plus now I got three kinds I gotta buy
I heard back in the day you gotta pay to play
But that and a lot of weed will make ya mask your pace

So you go out and get it ya gotta have it can't leave without it
You doubt it ya hit it ya outty bout to dream about it
And that's a promise that you can believe if you got cheese
Ya outta cheese three different kinds of weed

We get high on a daily regular basis
We get drunk all shook we in the matrix
My vision's slurred from the sizzurp I'm crazy
I wanna have a Whoopi Goldberg, baby

I mean she got it good she whole and is a lady
I put a bag over her face 'cause it don't phase me
I'm just a gigolo just tryin to get a baby
Maybe it's the drugs I'll tell ya you can't play me

Let me hit that nigga, let me hit that weed
Let me sniff that nigga, let me sniff that P
Let me sip that nigga, let me sip that lean
'Cause I'm a fiend nigga fuck with me

But little do they you when I touch em I see they life's trip

All the back stabbin' and jabbin' and double crossin'
Quit telling me that you love me nigga when you see me keep on walkin'

So I don't need a posin' friend that's leadin' me now, bitch

You know we gotta do one for all these niggaz out here sideline
Hatin' y' know what I'm sayin'... don't get mad cause a nigga straight up
Out the paint shop or car wash or the car lot or whatnot... feelin mean on

Of y'all hoes think a nigga gon give 'em somethin I can't give ya
Shit but this dick in ya muthafuckin' mouth and ya muthafuckin'

[Crunchy Blac]
I pull up clean in my black fuckin' truck
Rims still spinnin' so you know I'm cuttin' up
I'm ridin' down the street bumpin' nothin' but us
I spotted me a freak she was bout to catch a buzz
I asked her whats her name baby it could be love
But you know ya boy don't fuck wit nothin' but sluts
The ones that make money and stack them bucks
A bank for that cap and a bank for that butt
Slut

[Juicy J]
Nigga I'll tell yo gal she can suck on this big ol' dick
And won't be fucked up bout it if she pay her rent to a pimp
And in the publics' eyes she can be legit be my bitch
At the shake joint she gotta work a trick get the grip
Never no back talkin' cause I call her jack backhand slap
She come up short wit money baby then I snap wit a strap
She gotta let these hoes know who the shit runnin' this
And you just might have to throw some blows take a hit wit the fist

[Chorus:]
[DJ Paul and Mr. Bigg]
Don't cha get mad when I swerve and I twist
Ridin' ridin' down yo block I got my charm out the window
Don't cha get mad when I swerve and I twist
I ain't braggin' on myself but I deserve this miss

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
I'm swervin', I'm twistin' from side to side

Them 20-inch vogues wit the yellow stripes
A 'rillo rolled up wit some of that light
The 360 turn on the fold down screens
Turn it all the way around and watch it from the front seat
The knock in the back got the trunk on rattle
Them hoes flockin' to my whip thick like cattle

Some shit that's gonna blow through ya mutha fuckin speakers.
Y'all cats it too eager and no I don't believe ya.
Y'all cats ain't got much but you'll get burned.

Get slapped in ya face. get out the game.
You ain't in the right place. you must be out ya brain.

They can't hang with my swag or nuttin.

Shoot first ask questions later.
Ill see ya now but won't see ya later
I just gave credit to the grave bruh.
I got the dough got the dro
Got the hoes gotta speed up the flow

If you ain't bout money don't waste my time.
Hypnotize always gon shine.
Leave hoes shot from a gun of mine like

Still because of me

I'm just tryna get a mill I ain't tryna be a mack

I'm in the club posted up (up) got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scoping I'm just
Twisting my body from side 2 side (I'm just)

[Chorus: x2]
Now when I pull up at the club I'm lookin so clean
Seventy seven Cut Dog painted lime green
Today I'm married and my wife don't play
If ya want-if you want me to treat you ugly bitch you gotta pay

[DJ Paul]
Can it be Rolls that pull all these hoes
Or could it be my Cadillac wit 20-inch Vogues
Can it be my mansion in Memphis jacuzzi
Or could it be my crib in Florida on the beach
Can it be the ten million records that I sold
Or can it be the first one that ever go gold
Whatever it be like y'all jaw cause I don't stop
Continuously to make a ho draws drop, yeah

[Juicy J]
I used to always wonder why my girls have fits
When I walk up out the mall they be lookin at me pissed
Maybe just becuz I ball ridin eight or nine whips
And my name is Juicy J and I ain't payin no bitch
When I was broke as a joke they didn't wanna get wit me
Till I bought a Maybach now they all wanna lick me
Wit a Playboy mansion downtown in the city
And the hoes lined up like ninety centy pennies

[Chorus: x2]

I got the candy drippin' stains off the frame when I'm switchin' lanes
I'm in the slab glass house swangin' grippin' grain
They tellin' me I'm the mane stangin' licks to make a gain
Livin' life in the fast lane gettin' money I can't complain
These boppers see me ridin' swangin' wanna taste the fame
But you gotta break that bread wit me baby I'm married to the game
I fell in love wit stackin' change I'm addicted to countin' cash
I ain't worried bout naan ho I ain't concerned wit naan ass
I'm bout that dollar get it right I'm not out here lookin' for a wife
I'm out here on that top flight on the grind all day and night
I'm a baller I'm a pimp I'm a thug and I'm a hustler
If you want some of this lovin' break bread girl you a customer

See she's a freak ho let me tell you all a-bout it
I met her in the Valley and the valley ain't Cali
She tried to act shy but I knew she was bout it
Hotter than a summer day when it ain't cloudy
She say she want cheese but that's no doubt it
She just another ho I'ma hit then I'm out it
I'm just like Jody out the back door see
Hidin' my face cause her old man know me

Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you

Gotta keep my hustle tight, makin' change off these women, yeah

Juicy, juicy, fat, fat, cum run down ya crack
Man fuck a towel, I'ma let it shoot on her back
Ridin' Lac with the TV's, find a prostitute
Missy got this with ya bank, I'm gon' fuck with chu'

All in pursuit for a bitch with low self-esteem
(Man she say her pimp is a bitch)
Bitch, what the fuck you mean?
It could seem like I ain't strapped but it's in the holster
2-0-1 a revolvin' door or a roller coaster

Gettin' most of the game from these motherfuckin' jail walls
Hoes can't resist on these streets, hoes kissin' balls
Breakin' pimp laws, bitch that'll get cha' pimp smacked
You ain't got no cheese, oh, that'll get cha' head cracked

Wide a nigga, 'cause I'm from the south side of town
Be A Z, and I'm reppin', even if ya aren't around
I match a blunt with the real, shoot a bump with the real
But I ain't a baller, I just deal

With these drugs and thugs and these niggaz that's locked up
I lock em' down with some of that pure white stuff
Like some dro, pop a pill, sip some syrup, it ain't no deal
But you gotta stay the same when you high, keep it trill
And I still blow a blunt to take the pain out
'cause if I don't get high, I'd probably blow my fuckin' brains out

Walkin' through the crowd, knock your trick down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out
Twist another blunt, fill it real krunk
40 in the club, outside it's the pump
Top off the syrup, take me a swig
There go my dawgs, what's up my nigs?

Security starin', they better not try it
'cause we will start a mother fuckin' riot!
The crowd is swayin', Three 6 playin'

As a young nigga in the hood kinda pissed off
'cause I gotta big bank, and his pockets too short
Frustrated all the time, wanna tear the roof off
Wanna be a gangsta, but the nigga too soft
Kinda sissified, like that famous fagot, are you Paul
But he can not hide, letting them queers knock his boots off
Hope he get his shit together, grow up till he too tall
Instead of letting these rubbers go up in his ass, to raw

Niggaz hatin' on me, but they just don't know
See-be he gotta gun, and I'm 'bout to explode
Keep talking that shit, like you standin' ten toe
You don't know me nigga, you don't know me bro

That purple drank is what I sip, in my cell phone keep a chip
I'm talkin' bid'ness I put it down, I'm choppin' blades and I'm poppin' shrooms
I'm from the land of that fry smoke, got plex I got the pump
Weighted trunk and chunk the deuce, keep it movin' I'm on the prowl

Ye ain't got screens if they ain't touch screen

See a lil' freak, run some game, and she goin' I'ma take some brain

Uptown, hit the blush, or watch these diamonds blind you up
Nothin' but self-made millionaires so you corporate folks can shut the fuck

Where's the drank I'm runnin' low, Cabbage Head told me it's a drought
But not to worry dough never doubt, I'll go to the doctor with a cough
It's Paul Wall baby that's my name, fly like a plane what it do
I drop the top of my potnah plaque and chunk the deuce to that boy Gooch
Just like a midget I'm sittin' low, and like a snail I'm crawlin' slow
Where's Mike, where's Bawdy, he on the grind ducked on the low

You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad

Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags

Harder to escape than jail cells and bills

Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey

He got that devil in I'm police wanna take him down
Used to be a player but the Coochie cost money now
He ain't to bright but he know a trap when he see one
Got is conscious in his pants with his gun

Out there all by myself 'cause a player gotta get this mil
Wearin' fur ain't doin' us no good flippin' burgers ain't gon' make you filled

But I'm still ten toes in this hustlin' tryna make hood rich
And I still ain't trustin' no bitch 'cause the mother fuckers always snitch
It's hard in this ghetto man fifteen years old with coke and cane
Cheese don't come I'ma go insane snatch me a purse, snatch me a chain

Out here on the block with the fiends and the moon
Squeeze on the glock tryna pop at a goon
He done stole my dough, he took my food
Project wasn't born with a silver spoon

In my mouth, in my grill wear six chain then niggas get killed
One in the grave the other in jail, nobody wins that's fo' real
Back way when I was a runny nose runnin' round up and down
The town carrying a black glock and a gold frown

I kept that product on me, it wasn't no problem homie
You said it, I had it and met you if you stole my money
Just tryna buy bologna but now I'm buying lobster
Still totin' a glock but pushing a Rolls Royce and winning Oscars

Need a place to live a crib thats straight shit
With your mistaste niggas hate, say they real but they ain't
Catch 'em somewhere face to face, now they runnin place to place
Club hoppin', mall shoppin', gettin' high, sales droppin'
Now you wanna sober up, tell these niggas shoot that fuck

Dig this right?
A nigga caught a few bullshit charges when he was young right?
So now these motherfuckin' folks don't wanna give me a job ya hear?
But dig this
Now these motherfuckin' police wanna find me a new place to stay
Cause I'm on the corner, posted, sellin' yay
But they gon' have to deal with it
Cause I gotta motherfuckin' live with it ya hear?

[Chorus]
I'ma work this trap and give a damn about these hoes
Cause I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't
If you give me a yard I'ma give a eight of blow
Cause I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't
Call me, the corner man, corner corner man
Find me, on the corner man, on the corner man
Call me, the corner man, corner corner man
Find me, on the corner man, on the corner man

[Verse One]
I'm a Memphis, Tennessee, first 48'er
Give a damn 'bout these hoes give a damn 'bout these haters
If ye ain't talkin' money you can see a nigga later
You can catch me in the South, on my bank, fuckin' papered up
Bitch I sell white but I still do white
But at the end of the night I still give my price
And I get my money like a bee get honey
I got my profit even though some of it I done it
Cause a nigga can't work no 9 to 5
I got charges, but I gotta stay alive
And that's on everything, you know a nigga gotta eat man
And I'ma do it even if it's due to cocaine

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I'ma tell you some shit right here, real shit nigga
It's a lot of fake-ass niggas that be scared to bust
They hear them choppers then they back on up and shut the fuck
They say they shippin' keys, a hundred percent of that is cut
They say they in the game but niggaz takin' it up the butt
So quit lyin' to kick it, thinkin' you impressin' us
I bet you workin' with the feds and the blue crush
He smell the powder pack, then he wanna get loud and cuss
Nigga sit yo' snitchin' ass down 'fore you gettin' it up
Real niggas on the corner they don't have to talk
Cause they walk the walk, while yo' bitch-ass gettin' caught
I watched the first 48 on TV, Memphis raw
Think they from the bullets, cryin' and shit, man fuck nah!

But once she in your system
She a keep it crunk and back it buck like
Goin' off in the back with guns out make 'em give it up
She keep your heart beatin' fast 
In bathrooms I make her holla
Every time you see her she be with me foldin' my dollar

See I wreck you haters like wreck these cars
Then go and trade it in like I trade these broads
Walk up out a scrap without a fuckin' scar
Lookin' like force, still shining like a star
Me sucka I'ma vet not a veterinarian 
Get rid of your flesh as if I was a vegetarian
Fuck 'em feed 'em bullets let the ball barrel, carry them
Take 'em to they fuckin' family, where I'm goin' burry 'em
When I told 'em I was the king but they didn't wanna believe me
Till them bullets hit 'em now they startin' to believe me
Boy you done left 'em not even a guesser
What you started lickin' off your shirt that is a guess'a
You realize that I wasn't playin iwth your clan
You realize that you had the wrong fuckin' man

He don't want to come up out the wallet then I bluck 'em fine
He done blew my high so I had to blow his life away
Blew a couple lines just send my conscious on his way
Pouted on some crime then I pulled up on 'em blank block

Skeeted off the lot, made a lick, thinkin' it was love
Bag full shredded chase coke, blunt it

Yeah whats happening?

Across the street from this dope house, I want the loot
And all the drugs, weed, rocks, quarters, keys, or that juice
I'm about to go in with them guns out ready to shoot
The police rollin' down the block, pull up hold up a second
They just patrolin' I need to get 'em 
The time is now I got my ski mask a K and a pump
I call you back in about an hour with some blocks in the trunk
I'm running across the street, I'm playin' it like a beast
With chains on my hands, shackles on my feet
My second robbery, my heart rate just increased
I'm kicking down the black door, put 'em up

[Chorus: x2]

Now don't show it if you ain't goin' share it
Fuck around and get your pistol across your head
You better look like the hood when you roll through it
Or find your monkey ass leaking red and gray fluid
They will do it, my dogs meaner then them laws
We ain't sellin', you ain't comin' in our hood to fuck with Paul
Make his car alarm go off as soon as he step out

Life is beautiful man
But niggas don't respect niggas, you know what i'm sayin?
You help a man out just for him to dog you out
Niggas don't appreciate shit, fuck 'em all!

So you crack this weed
It's respect that'll cost my nigga
Double back through the water if you cross a nigga
It's greasy at the top, don't fall off my nigga
And get lost my nigga
I'm a marijuana smokin', never been broken
I don't give a fuck about the po-lice, I'm a hood star!
Sixty inches on my Impala
Daddy I'm a motherfuckin' gangster

These niggas wanna be in my shoes, but they feet too small
They only yell so I turn to, just to see me fall
The new code in the streets, that's used by the phony
If you can't beat him, just call the police on him
Or hate on him so bad try to turn the world against him
Go in the studio like a hoe make some bullshit and dis him
But none of that surprise me I done been through it all
17 years in the game, real game, DJ Paul
I done seen the real, I done seen the fake
I done seen fake bitches turn real to fake
Cause hateism is a disease, it's kinda like AIDS
They feed you shit for years, and then they send you to your grave

So you crack this weed

First I'm broke, so I hang out with the rat and roach
And still broke, cause I'm sleepin' on apartment flo's
The hood struggle is to get it, got to make the change
See every dark is like the dark cloud full of rain
You wonder why niggas high and they robbin' folks
Ain't nothin' to tell you but to pack yo' heat and let it go
Them junkies get a fuckin' kick, when they smoke a brick
I never seen a drug dealer ever call it quits
But get money (yes sir!) Make the block pop off
Niggas snitchin' man they heads will get chopped off
The feds tappin fool it's dangerous when you hood trappin'
So don't get lost in the sauce slingin cold crack'n

One on one, leave the guns at home, keep 'em on the shelf
But you can't, cause you need a crew, extra fist or two
Only one, might really shoot, but that is not you
And you show out, try to buck, make 'em think you tough
Been to jail about a couple times, I guess that puffed you up
If you real nigga what the deal? Take some weed or pills
Maybe thinkin' get your confidence up, tell 'em how you feel
You a Jew, and a fuck nigga, can't stand yo' grind
But you walk around, fake-ass frown, but I know you're a clown bitch!

Or maybe get some head while I'm ridin in the car

Always fresh when I'm at the club

Or behind the bar she dy-no-mite~!

And I didn't feed her nothin but some dick and bubblegum
She want mo' I give her some, I keep them magnums, I'm strapped
And if she tired, lay down, just place yo' head in my lap
Ay Big Oomp Records on the map, we keep that mouth wide open

From the North to the South I'm pokin, every time this a hit it gets greater
Two choices that she got to make, she can chew me now or later

Niggas thinkin' that they hurtin' me, I'm the one that's payin' me
This ain't one man to grow on, real niggas keep this in mind
Never cash yo' pearls from off these snakes, and these fuckin' swines
Show less than necessary, keep these fakers off in the dark
Half off these niggas ain't happy for ya, over half wanna see you robbed
Try to get yo' hook up, course you have to get your connect
They ain't heard of the word love, they ain't heard of the word respect
Never let 'em know what'chu got, don't work with friends, use enemies
Bitch you wanna be me? Hoe don't play me

[Bridge] 

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
You actin' like you hard, and you say what you done robbed (hell naw!)
You say you from the hood, and you claimin' all the parts (hell naw!)
I heard you sold a little dope but then I heard you didn't (hell naw!)
I know you on the dog food, cause that's why you was itchin' (hell naw!)
They say you just a lil' bitch, a look can be deceiving (hell naw!)
They say you carry a big gun, but I don't believe that either (hell naw!)
And every girl you talk you make as if you knocked it up (hell naw!)
Is you 16 on down, nigga what the fuck? (naw!)
I know you gotta make some ends, lie and shit to impress your friends
Say you own a big boy Benz, did 20 years in pen
Flaugin' like you own own, flaugin' cause you known known
Don't you know I'm grown grown, and I crack yo' dome dome

Get real high in the DJ booth
If you got drink nigga thats cool
Slangin' them pills ill take that to 
Don't give a fuck any drug is a go
Everyday day party with a nigga party roll
Gotta a lot friends and they all do dope
Jack that weed and Jill keep blow
Just woke up still high as a fool
Girl in my bed, ""man who is you?""
She said, ""we was on the dance floor gettin' zoomed""
Next thing you know we was off in the pool
I ain't goin' like, then say it, I hit it
Cause when we do ex I run up in it
The girl had cocaine runnin' out her nose
Powder pill white like the fist caught ?
I put it in her mouth, then I kicked her out my house
Memphis niggas be so wild, now I'm back out on the town

[Chorus]

I say the money talk, you say you trappin' jumpin' off
I'm in the A ridin' dirty man, drop it off
What it cost? If you gotta ask man don't even bother
I pullin' out in and about, them goin' yell yay with you robbers
Doing so good, but see I been better
I keep it so hood, I see more cheddar
I got the best price, call me the cost cutter
Can any nigga beat my quote, not a nanother
I got that Tylenol for your body turn to soft
Meet me in the P-A-Z parking lot of Southlet mall
I got the blue pills, I'm tryin' to pay the bills
Just get the meat in the haven then come to your crib

Rocks under in my balls, pistol up in my draws
A bird a blow, and cable break quarters and halves off
The blow is coming through, this ain't a casino but I'm your dealer
Dro in my challenger, like Al Pacino and stop this nigga
The jack boys talk a lot of noise but on the real'a
Got some killers posted up, every door fingers on trigger
Heroin is so intense, the syrup going by the ounce
Put some money in my hand, cop it good then I'ma bounce

See I ain't the nigga that was up at 5 o'clock sellin' no rocks
I'm that nigga that was out at midnight just to drop off a block
In a tinted out Maxima they low keying quick 
Snortin' up the door, with a glock and a truck full of bricks
I make the trap boom boom, without even trouchin' it
As for my black hatinzolas, I'm just supplyin' it
I went to Key West and picked it up back in Memphis broke it up
Call my nigga Errol and Chris then we split it up

His dope sales are up, a nigga feel embellished
His pockets swellin' up cause of everything he's sellin'
The heat is on the street bout niggas gettin' jealous
The choppers on the seat to cut you up like relish
The hood ain't change cause these niggas still tellin'
To lock this nigga up, a two time felon
This boy ain't bullshittin' he'll kick in doors and kill 'em
And hide them bodies good so you cant even smell 'em
We nigga rich and ignorant so fuck who in your click
This gangsta life he livin' it so fuck your wife and your kids
These janky niggas out on the town I hope they know the biz
To all you faro taddletails swap out where you live

Is that 80 percent of black people in jail

Need to take a seat when you takin' all them pills
Passed out on the street, your body rollin' down hills
This dope got my voice sounding like its chopped and screwed up [Repeat: x5]
That cash on my feet so I'm crawlin to this cooler
To just get in here I gotta keep my buzz flowin'
You wanna get high with me man, keep your shit potent

I grabbed me a gram of that dro, I brake it brake it down
Keep it in plastic, I hit hard, shake it shake it down
Grind it down fine, chop it up make it powdery
Cut into lines on the plate with the razory
Listen closely must be done on smooth surfaces
No wood get them splinters in your noses
Get a straw cut it short slang it at the end
Two inches long now you good go on and dig in
If its your first time you probably wont feel it 
Don't worry about it cause it might take a minute
Before I leave I got some more advice to tell
Rub it on a hoe clit, make her cum right here, yeah

Three 6 Mafia,"This for all my players out there ridin',
Spinners I don't care where you at, the club parking lot the expressway
Whatever what I want you to do right now is just stop
And let 'em keep spinnin' baby

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

Pedal to the metal then stop
Take another sip from the syrup then stop
Let my seat back, drop the top then stop
See me something sexy, spot that ass I gotta stop

My rims so shiny they clear like flat screen plasma
Gals faint when they see 'em it's hard to breathe, like they got asthma
Older people trippin' 'cause they think they seein' thangs
My car sittin' still but my rims still rolin' man, they off the chain

Everybody let ya spin wheels spin like a spin mill
Juicy J on certain pills, cruisin' down to Knoxville
See them thangs shinin'
Sparkin' like a diamond, bumpin' the Alpine, why you's a lyin'

Eyes like a Chinese, I'm drinkin' on the heiny
I'm ridin' on the strip, any party you can find me
You rollin' with the finest the north Memphis highness
You ball till ya fall, till a player aged ninety

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop

I got twenty inch spinners on my drop
Nothin' but white and yellow rocks in my watch
I'm doin' one fifty so I'm watchin' for the cops
Since I'm in the Lamborghini I ain't gon' stop

I'm packin' a Glock believe it or not I'm ready to bust
And down here we drink purple and we drink that, trust
So grab a cup juice so I can pour it up
And if you represent yo hood, go on throw it up

It's the L-I-L, F-L-I-P
If I ain't smokin' trees, I'm pokin' freaks
So throw the row of keys and let me roll
'Cause this the way we ball, I'm just lettin' you know

We like our music slow but our cars go faster
I'm in the V-12 with my cousin Big Shasta
I'm Lil' Flipper and I'm a top ten seller
Everybody slowin' down 'cause my drop is yellow

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

I saw my dog with the center circles so I
They spinnin' like a saw so don't touch 'em when I
I saw a shanky broad that owe me money so I
See me choke the hell up out my broad when I

When ya stand by the blades you can feel a slight breeze
Stop by House of Dubs just to keep 'em on clean
Fell up in the Peabody, the most expensive suite
Them thangs still spinnin' when I filled out the receipt

I used to be clean in my expedition
A girl see me and she'll be wishin'
That I'd stop and spit some pimpin'
It's mackin' in me baby, I just thought I would mention

She got hot like in the kitchen
You see my kin folks, cars and glisten
Ain't nothin' like Sprewells 'cause they spinnin'
It's CB baby I'm just in it to win it

Three Dog Night,"April gave us springtime and the promise of the flowers
And the feeling that we both shared and the love that we called ours
We had no time for sadness, that's a road we each had crossed
We were living a time meant for us, and even when it would rain
we would laugh it off.

I've got pieces of April, I keep them in a memory bouquet
I've got pieces of April, but it's a morning in May

We stood on the crest of summer, beneath an oak that blossemed green
Feeling as I did in April, not really knowing what it means
But it must be then that you stand beside me now to make me feel this way

Three Dog Night,"I sleep all day, out all night

I don't think that's actin' right
You don't think it's showin'

A jumpin' up, fallin' down
Don't misunderstand me
You don't think that I know your plan

Three Fish,"Stay...Deal...Say...Steal...Stay...Stay
Star born, star form
All the monkeys in my head
All their tongues are turning red
A star
Oh, I replied...how so
Oh, I say...how so
Star born, star formed
All the monkeys in my head
I alone, well, I've been thinking
A stranger to the lights been sinking
Leaves are falling like they're drinking....
Star!
Star born, star form
All the monkeys...
All the dreams that I've come to save
All my life has turned to rage
Nothing here, suppose to play
All messed up
All messed up in a changing world
All messed up in a changing world",All Messed Up,1996
Three Fish,"They're lovers again
The sun is the moon : an amalgam
Their gold and silver melt together
This is the season of the dead branch, the green branch, of the same branch

The cynic bites his finger because he can't understand
The cynic bites his finger
Nightmares fill with light like the holiday
Men and angels speak one language
The elusive ones finally meet

The essence of evolving forms will run to meet each other like children
Good and evil, dead and alive
Everything blooms from one natural stem
Good and evil, dead and alive...

They're lovers again",Elusive Ones,1996
Three Fish,"Heaven's a word where she come from
Haven't a word where she's gone
And in a word, I am alone
Into the dark where she's gone
Here in the darkness, she cries more
Here in the darkness, she crawls
Here by her side, I am alone
And by her side, I have grown
Here by her side, I have not known
Here by her side, I have flown
And in the darkness, I have roamed
And in the darkness, I have clung
Here in the darkness, where she runs
She runs, she will run, she will run",Here in the Darkness,1996
Three Fish,"Like a sound he lay in the folds of her sweetness
Like a word she had made for a necklace
Laced
If she should fall away
Into the water
There she was in a tenderly fashion
Felt the life in a whisper
Once entwined, tore the page from the mirror
Laced
If she should fall away
If she should fall away
Into the water
So inside, in her tenderly fashion
Felt the life so entwined in a whisper
Laced
If she should, if she could, if she should
If she should fall away
Into the water",Laced,1996
Three Fish,"My mother roams through leaves
Of white wet galleries of hope and heartache
I am surrounded
By the eyes of hollow men gazing
From their haunted chambers
In the wastelands of ecstasy
Bearing pains the names no one remembers...why
You are in their vision, you are
Idiot reigns where nothing's revealed
My voice in chains, my lips are sealed
A secret place, I shed my tears
A secret place, I shed my tears...why
You are in their vision...you are
In their vision, you are
In their vision",Secret Place,1996
Three Fish,"Storm wind blows from the west to the east
Where can I find you, where can I find you
Storm wind blows from the belly of the beast
Where can I find you, where can I find you
Young man staggered as they offered him the dream
Almost was a promise, but he began to scream
Silence at the bottom of the well
How can I find you, how can I find you...silence
One more time to touch god's face
How can I find you, how can I find you
Dripping girl sold the world so she could make the scene
Lines engraved on an empty page told her stories in between
Where can I go, how can I know
Is this real or is it just a dream
From out of the storm a shout was born, that turned into a scream
Silence at the bottom of the well
Silence at the bottom of the well
Dripping girl sold the world so she could make the scene
Lines engraved on an empty page told her story in between
How can I know, where can I go
Is this real or dream
From out of the storm a shout was born, that turned into a scream
Silence at the bottom of the well
Silence at the bottom of the well",Silence at the Bottom,1996
Three Fish,"Dawn breaks, I am alone
I'm awake, eyes unopened
Half in the dark, half in the room
Half in the light sealed by your womb
Sail soon my eyes out in the dark
Oceans of sighs, adrift in her bark
Islands lay scattered, island won't talk
Life hardly matters here in the dark
I want you in solitude
I need you in solitude
I want you in solitude
I haunt you in solitude 
Once a jester in circles of friends
Spoke in whispers, star words and gems
See through my scars, make them mend
Adrift on her bark, once was a friend
Sail away, I sail away, I sail nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
Hear her laugh through the air
Down from the past into my lair
I want you in solitude
I need you in solitude
I want you in solitude
I haunt you in solitude",Solitude,1996
Three Fish,"And sat on beaches when children play
The mountain sky as long as day
And spied on people's timid dreams
And countless sands and endless green
And crystal bead-words in her eyes
How all the dead words made you high
In perfumed plains, a seabird flies
You and I, we'll make great friends
In distant messages I've read
In traveling bands and strangers' beds
A butterfly flies so amused
Like from her hair in crimson hues
And crystal bead-words in her eyes
How the dead words made you high
In perfumed plains, the seabird flies
You and I, you and I, we'll make great friends
We'll make great friends
And psychedelic, electric rain
It gently falls through her brain
Young flower nightfall closed her hands
Her tripper ship, it touched the sand
And crystal bead-words in her eyes
How the dead words made you high
In perfumed plains, the seabird flies
You and I, you and I 
But in the forest
And twisted in colors
Tossed in the mirrors
In leaping laughter
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
I need a miracle",Song for a Dead Girl,1996
Three Fish,"We stayed up that night
It was cold in the north
I gave you my prayer
And you gave me your word
Don't remind me now, don't remind me
You gave me a light from the smoke that you turned
Spoke of your life like a fire that still burned
Don't remind me, don't remind me, don't remind me, time to go
Time to go home, time
When I was a child I dreamed of sailing ships
I saw them sink into the horizon
I saw their sails, I felt the wind on my lips
Time to go",Zagreb,1996
Three Fish,"The sun is damning, please let go
Not with the memory, it'll drag you down below
Jump at his dancers, out on the ledge, can't feel the edges
Love dragged all her friends inside
Was a melody she lifted by the wall
Jogged through the memories traded for the hollow pillow
Innocent Christians no joy for love
No eyes were hoping until love without words
Like a river to the ocean, like a drop of rain, like a weeping willow
Tears falling from her wings
That's all these things
Your eyes are smiling, your mouth is crying
Your eyes like poets, open up every cruel door
Jump at his dancers, for something that seems so twisted
Undone but this December
Now she can call it her own
I don't want to be a lover, don't want to need it before you
Not as a lover
She's lying in the dark
Just like a machine
She's lying in the dark
Now it's only trouble, tears falling from her wings",All These Things,1999
Three Fish,"One, two, three, four
Of the men who were loved by you
Some were looking for a woman to play
One who could venture to the empty rooms
And carry their bodies away
Of course there's a ghost
And maybe one was a king
He whispered but never came through
One so alone, sad as a poem who hovered by the window then flew
Away from poison rainbows
Away from fallen snow
Away from stumbling footsteps
Away from so alone
But to lie down beside you
To feel the heart beat in your breath
To carry my song to you
To bury the words inside
Is all I really want
Twisted and simple,
You curled into the shoulder
Of a joker that could not surrender
Like some endless river,
He broke into the layers
Sunsets darken the waters
Of course there was laughter
In this shelter of strangers
In the rooms of ""I love you""
""I love you""
One so alone, sad as a poem
Who hovered by the window then flew
Away from poison rainbows
Away from fallen snow
Away from stumbling footsteps
Away from so alone
But to lie down beside you
To feel the heart beat in your breath
To carry my song to you
To bury the words inside
Is all I really want",Hummingbird,1999
Three Fish,"While the elders are weeping
In the old courts of laughter
Spilling tears on velvet, tears spun from dew
Draped from the lace
Where the elders are weeping

Come, come, see for yourself
Come, come, see for yourself

Three Fish,"In a way you know, I have sown in out
It's been a terrible snow in a world
In a proud, in a shadow, in a tower, in a tower
In a gale
Once in a day
I was out, I can not be here
Saw the sun, was it always
In a while, holding outside, holy child in a tower
In a terror
Once in a day
And she's in love with a man she once despised

It's just life on a course like a wild, running horse
With no limits or bounds or ties
Once, once a day",Once in a Day,1999
Three Fish,"There's a child that sings soft and warm
There's a bell that rings every Sunday morn
There's a bird of love; has no place to mourn
It swept him blindly through the air
And left him broken
There's a wind that goes from the strangest ocean
And a jasmine rose; songs of roses
There's unfathomed sounds in a place called nowhere
And the silent ground in these breaths
It swept him blindly through the air
And left him opened
He left the world without a tear
When he crossed over

In a world without tears
Farewell
Fare thee well

In every ruse he bid farewell
When he crossed over",Shiva and the Astronaut,1999

Three Impotent Males,"The homeless in the street can't find a fuckin' place to sleep
As the political criminal turns up the thermostat
Someone scrapes the bottom of the barrel just to eat
And we all become so fat

We're so fuckin' stupid we don't give back what we take
We frown on the less fortunate and poor
No one cried when the homeless guy died
Apparently if you're famous it matters more

As long as we're protected from the outside
Fairy tale wonderland
Stand alone don't understand
As our souls slowly died

At twelve years old that's no way to go

There's a door that open, and the moment you walk in it close

Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help

Three Mile Pilot,"Amongst the ghosts there is a secret to life
Over buildings they brought to you their souls of the dead
Could volcanoes lie so still
I could never replace you

No matter how many times I kill you
You find these ways to live through the end

All of them pushed to the side
In the sands

I was cut from that seed
That's why I am blind
And I'm not saving for that day and I don't care who reigns

In my grave I'm showered by these things you cover
In my grave the shadows pin two houses wide

Its overwhelming how they want it all back
The devils always red
Do you see
From a city inside the earth as outside volcanoes cry my brother I must kill

Now I see
To win the game
On a sure foot
All of them
In the sands

And I was cut from that seed
That's why I am blind
And I'm not saving for that day
And I don't care when it rains

Alright it's that time of the year you've been waiting for, for months now
Saving up your pay trying to figure all your funds out
It's kinda funny when you think of all the fun
How it's taken this long to shake last year's comedown
Forget the past, as soon as December starts
Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don't get in last
Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass these days
A week late can mean paying triple when you bpay off ebay (true)
It's hard to figure out what tickets you want, should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock?
Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don't listen to rock, or hip hop
I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch
If your favourite band's there you'll think you'll never forget
You'll probably get that wasted you won't remember their set
But if you're a festival head then you already know the plan
Go and pack up all your shit 'cause you're going on a trip for those summer days

Oh, summer days

For those summer days
I love summer days

Man I'm not squishing in the back
I'm telling you, shotgun front
Nah, bullshit man

Now when you finally make it there from driving up with your crew
You better get your mind set on finding something to do
'Cause you'll be stuck there lining up in the queue
Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts, all to get your car searched
And if your alcohol you're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bags
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans
It doesn't matter, everybody has their secret plan
Once your crew start picking your spot
Unpacking, realize all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost
Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks
And dudes too excited already sitting there sloshed
It doesn't take long before you find somebody blazing up

I know, it's freezing man, Jesus Christ!

Now as soon as the sun rises you'll be ready to start
At six o'clock standing there outside your tent with a glass
You're in it for the long haul, it doesn't end when it's dark
We all know you've got your friends to make your energy last
And you gotta time it so you peak it while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into back stage
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
Nah, they're not those pills, I need them for my back pain
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates ""I love you man!""
Or on a walk so they can go and call their Mum and Dad (it's Pez)
And then there's people who so desperately just need a friend
They're going up to anybody trying to have a D&M (yeah, my family)
The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live
You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite

I didn't even hear the countdown or anything

Now by the last day you're probably thinking summer's the worst
'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packing to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue
Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends
But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again

(Michelle): 	Cause I needed somebody to talk to.
(ES): 		But you're trying to make it seem like I started it all.
(Michelle): 	I just told her the story the way it went.
(ES): 		Michelle.
(Michelle): 	What?
(ES): 	Look.  Since you seem to be forgetting, I'm a tell you the story
from the beginning. Aiight?
(Michelle): 	Umm hmmm.

Cruising down the Ave with my homeboy Boove
Laying back like jack, mellowing to the groove.
The ""Greatest Man Alive"" was cold rocking my world.
Then I rocked a little harder when I saw this fresh, fly girl.
A hold up.  I can't go out like a nut.
I had to conjure out a cool way to strut.
They call me E.S., the overlord of fresh.
I saw you in the dress, and I just had to impress.
My compliment, came through in a clutch
She started to blush.  Then I knew what was up.
Called her next morning.  Said, ""What'll it be?
Dinner and a movie or just chillin' with me?""
She said, ""Me.""  So I went and got the slimy.
But as soon as I opened the door she said, ""Gimme!""
It was like I was a bone, and she was fetching.
She gobbled, cold swallowed my one's like Greedy Gretchin.
Then after a couple of weeks of good loving my friends,
She did the dummy move, and started asking for my dividends.

(Chorus)  
(DJ Wood scratches): 	Rah rah, rah rah rah

(Verse2)
Come around the corner looking funki fresh.
This new jack babe started popin' a mess.
Steady trip, cause I didn't call her last night.
I kindly pulled her to the side n' said, ""Yo, take a hike.
Cause I don't need it girl.  Too many problems in this world.
So go on ahead with your jheri curl.
She wanted Jefferson's and Lincoln's.
I said, ""No way!  Yo Slim, what do you think this is?  President's Day?
People start buggin' over things like that honey.
You know the time!  So don't act funny with my money.
I refuse to abuse my savings and loans.
So if you want some ends baby, you best go with your own.
Now I said it once before, and I'm a say it again: Best believe you
won't receive no dividends.""

(Interlude)
(ES):		 Michelle, how come every time we argue, it got to be about
money?
((Michelle): 	When I was with Steady be	, I had it all: Gucci, Louie
Vaton, gold, 
Liz Claiborne.  I had it all.  You ain't giving me nothing.

(Verse 3)
It's a shame.  Nowadays you've got to stay paid.
It ain't like the old days, when you could serenade.
Take walks  with your girl at night in the park,
And in the shadow, secretly steal her heart.
But the new wave 80's has everything reversible.
Instead of walks, you drive a Cadillac Convertible.
Two's bound to kill you.  All you need is one
To constantly bug you to get her hair done.
Every weeks a new style.  She's always got to rock it.
Like a Super Bowl sack, she's tackling your pockets.
But when you want to chill, you find that something always blocks it.
You're looking for your wallet, but your girlfriends got it.
I tried to put you D [own], cause you was my friend.
You didn't listen.  Now she's got you for your dividends.

(ES's male friend): ""You bought another dress?  This is ridiculous!  
     That's the third dress this week!""

(2x: DJ Wood scratches in JFK sample: ""The world is very different
now."")

(Verse 4)
Now I don't like to get upset, and I don't like to riff.
But one thing that gets me hype is when girls shoot the gift.
Now there's a little saying about the J-O-B.
But what she's really trying to do is take your D-O-E
N' wreck your whole check on the latest design.
When you're broke, it's all a joke.  But when your paid, it's fine.
This advice to you I lend.  Begin to let it sink, and you can spin.
But don't be taking nothing my friend.
Now I said it once before, and I'm a say it again:
""Best believe you won't receive no dividends.""
Now I said it once before, and I'm a say it again.
""Best believe you won't receive no dividends.""

(Prologue)
Word.  Ya know what I'm saying?  
I don't mind giving my girl something-
or any woman for that matter-ifthey need it.  
But love shouldn't be used as a personal VISA card on the strength.  
Cause the same way you're trying to get somebody, you can get got.  
Workers large still in effect.  Ain't that right Wood?

(Wood scratches):  ""Ye-yeah!...ye-yeah!""

(Michelle): Why you looking at me like that ES?
(ES):  Cause man Michelle, if I had known you were going to do me like
this, 
I would have never stepped to you from the giddy up.
(Michelle): Well, if I had known you weren't going to provide for me, 
I wouldn't have talked to you anyway. Straight up.  
I thought you was the Greatest Man Alive.  But I guess I was wrong.
(ES):  Psssh.  I wonder if my grand pops and pops 
went through things like this back in the day.  Cause man, this ain't
worth it.

Untamed as I make you call out my name

Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,

Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,

When all your credence and candour are put in their place
You’ll find the boldness to abandon the future you face

open the wounds and share them then soon they start to heal

Into fluorescent white

Close the doors, and I am gone

To a stranger, and I realize
That empty words are not enough

What have I to show except
The promises I never kept?
I lie here shaking on this bed
Under the weight of my regrets

It feels like no one really cares
It gets me down, but I'm still gonna try to do
What's right, I know that there's a

Difference between sleight of hand
And giving everything you have
There's a line drawn in the sand
I'm working up the will to cross it

And I hope, that I will never let you down
And I know, that this can be more than just

Rhetoric can't raise the dead, I'm sick of always
Talking, when there's no change

But I don't know the first thing about love

I prophesize and know all mysteries
All hidden things are opened up to me
But I don't know the first thing about love
Don't know the first thing about love

I have the keys to open any door
Give all my possessions to the poor
But I don't know the first thing about love

And moving mountains ain't a thing to me
Have faith enough to cast them to the sea
But I don't know the first thing about love
I don't know the first thing about love

All other things shall fade away
Love stands alone and still holds sway
All other things shall fade away
Into the ground into the grave

I give my body up into the flames
And never once have I denied your name
But I don't know the first thing about love
I don't know the first thing about love
I don't know the first thing about love",Moving Mountains,2008
Thrice,"From tender years you took me for granted
But still I deigned to wander through your lungs
While you were sleeping soundly in your bed
(Your drapes were silver wings; your shutters flung)

I drew the poison from the summer's sting
And eased the fire out of your fevered skin
I moved in you and stirred your soul to sing
And if you'd let me, I would move again

I've danced 'tween sunlight strands of lover's hair
Helped form the final words before your death
I've pitied you and plied your sails with air
Gave blessing when you rose upon my breath

And after all of this, I am amazed
That I am cursed far more than I am praised",Silver Wings,2008
Thrice,"It's coming down
These clouds could never save me
From such a juggernaut of weight
Your dance and jingle cabaret
It's coming down
The shadow's forming on the pavement
We face a watershed of hate
Just miles apart the world's away

[Chorus]
The sky is falling
And no one will live the last sea
The sky is falling
And no one will care as long as it lands over seas

It's coming down
This ship would never save me
My family from certain death
If we could leave, we would have left
It's coming down
My little girl is just a baby
And I'm scared that she wont make her teens
My fear just fuels the hate machine

[Chorus]

[x3]
I'm going to be strong enough
And not let my fear decide my fate
Surrounded by dream goers
I don't want any part of this

[Chorus]",The Sky Is Falling,2008
Thrice,"Well you know I hardly speak
When I do, it's just for you
I haven't said a word in weeks
Cause they've been keepin' me from you

There's a way where there's a will
You know I got no need for stairs
Step out on the window sill
Fall with me into the air

Here we go, hold on tight and don't let go
I won't ever let you fall
I love the night, flying o'er these city lights
But I love you most of all

And there's something you should know
Girl you should have died that day
And you fell reaching for the rose
But baby I was there to save you

Here we go, hold on tight and don't let go
I won't ever let you fall
I love the night, flying o'er these city lights
But I love you most of all

Here we go, hold on tight and don't let go
I won't ever let you fall

But I love you most of all",A Song for Milly Michaelson,2008

Tilt yo head back, now finish the cup

[Verse 2: Kaine]
Alcohol seepin outta your pores
Smellin like a liquor bearer steady talkin to whores
Say that nigga so drunk, he'll fuck the floor (fuck the floor) fuck the floor
When the day start a liquor in tank

But the goose got him loose so he don't give a fuck
He just whip it to the bar to get another cup

[D-Roc]
I drink grey goose, call me the ugly duckling
You ain't put in on this, you ain't drankin nothin

Come down Mississippi, tonight
As we all watch under big lights

You grow up fast and lonely
With the lines to mark your face
Bet you never felt so empty
Have you wasted all your days?

We're you born from the seed of disguise?
Do you pray to become undone?
You're the best of all that you know
So uncover me in the big lights

[Chorus: ]
Come down Mississippi tonight
As we all watch under big lights
Why don't you come down Mississippi tonight
As we all watch under big lights

Why don't we talk to the dead
When the living's all the same
Why do we crawl like babies, baby
Why don't we light up anyway

And she carries him with her
And save you

When she fell down
And she found herself in bed alone

Don't hate our bodies so bad
I'm looking to you I hope more
And junk in my pelvic bones will be
Each time each times three
And save you each time and save you

Throwing Muses,"Was a man took a hand, cleared the ground
Dug a hole we called home
Sprawled here
Eleven years, forty-four seasons
We came unstuck and it stung

Unstuck-ness flew me
Though the air whispered in my ear
This is chaos and it stings
Tiny strings across the United States
Run from you to me and to everyone we ever breathed with

I don't care if you're sad
I don't care if you're heart is breaking
You soothe me and you turn me on
Speed and sleep

I lock the dogs in the car
And cut across the parking
L'm far away today
But I might as well not be

You quit making mistakes
I might not leave
You quit making mistakes
I might just stay



",Speed and Sleep,2003
Throwing Muses,"I dreamed you saw the eyes of a paranoid man
And quit your vision of the millennium
Leaving our hopes in the hands of the psychics

Peace isn't quiet, I'm heading down the freeway
I'm hanging on the frequency of your voice
I'm drunk on the sound of your voice

I dreamed I climbed a hill in the midnight mud
You turned a blind eye to the baby
Leaving our hopes in the hands of the psychos

Peace isn't quiet, I'm heading down the freeway
I'm hanging on the frequency of your voice
I'm drunk on the sound of your voice

There are sapphires in the trees
And the moths as big as bats
Lucky me, to have all that

What do you have on your mind?
What do you have on your mind?

There are sapphires in the trees
And the moths as big as bats
Lucky me, to have all that

What do you have on your mind?
What do you have on your mind?

It don't fit
You've put wildinto it
I'm amazed
You've put wild into it
What can I give you
What can I give

Cool place
I'm amazed
You rock me into space
You put cake
Down my throat
And in my face
What can I give you
What can I take

Kissing you is like kissing gravel
But feel's like getting off
Kissing you is like sinking
Down into the moss
You look better upside down
You look better lying down

On the move
I can lose
All my sympathy for you
Sitting straight
On the back of mother hate
What can I tell you
What can I say

On my knees
I can see
All your better qualities
So you freeze
I make frozen into heat
What can I tell you
That you'll believe

Kissing you is like kissing gravel
But feels like getting drunk
Kissing you is like sinking
Down into the mud
You look better upside down
You look better lying down

To be just enough deranged
To relax
In the arms of someone strange

You won't want to do it

Don't come looking for me
I'll come looking for you

I had a dream about you just the other night
Your hair was braided I know you really hated it
Walking down the sidewalk
You better take cover
Don't step on a crack if you love your mother

You phone me from the highway
You said you'd be here Friday

The air just filled with smoke

And I poured my heart out

When the ship goes down, remind me to thank her
Cause we're all gonna be tied to the anchor
And you and your friends can have a laugh at my expense
Cause I don't have a defense

The only thing that matters if it matters at all
Is the way that the pieces fall
And why you always stand so tall
The only thing that matters if it matters at all
Is what we don instead
If you quit while you're ahead

You never overwhelm
You're always a the helm
And as the picture fades

The men that you adore
Are knocking on your door
And how can you ignore?
Their simple compliments
Their money was well spent on you in case you went
And you went

And you came
And you went

And up upon the screen 
The ugly and obscene
The act within the scene
I've seen the way you act
And how you stay intact
The fiction and in fact
The facts that you create
Have made the great debate
So embrace the ones you hate
The meek and the ashamed
The liar just renamed himself for you in case you came
And you came

And you came
And you went

You lie and that's the truth

You lie between our teeth

And your dramatic grief

That did surround me
I felt the pathos
Nearly drown me
I felt resistance

Your stories are too sad for human ears
We all feel bad for leaving you alone
All my sympathy goes out to your bad knee

I am the one that you mistook
Lost in the pages of your book

Thrush Hermit,"So you're aching for forgiveness and an answer to your pleas
Your mouth is spitting curses and everyone agrees
That you take down every hand
You slap 'em and mis-pick 'em

Distances and romance are making your pulse quicken
So sad, you never even shed a tear
So sad, but everyone will disappear
I left this fragile body for dead

I went and met the hipsters instead

It makes me sadder
If you ever miss me
I will always miss you more
In North Dakota we can only waste our time

In my heart of hearts I know the static will start
From now until the end

But a fan before a friend

My first words was ""Thug for life,"" and ""Papa pass the Mac.""
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini fourteen callin' 
From out the window of my drop top, I got my Glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas, when will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin, will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have yo' Nike's on - cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on, hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind, cause motherfuckers tryin' to rush me
Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'
Comin' out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never, never die I'll be a hustler motherfuckers
And makin' thugs out you suckers from the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet
So now a young nigga's bein' raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight - thug; just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats - one black and one of chrome
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave
I'm glad to say, I made it this far
Many G's died hogs and all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land
That's the war zone, I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home with out my sugar, I'm hafta plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me since then I been knowin'
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin at marks, get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money, and through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum
I tried to cope loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I'm gettin my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock slingin rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscin' bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin' dirt
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

Time's movin' fast, will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did wishin' someone held me but they never did
I can't take it, will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me, crazy
Do or die, nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tec-9
I got nothin' to lose, payin dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm comin'
Start runnin' yellin' ""evil mind"" as I'm gunnin'
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave
