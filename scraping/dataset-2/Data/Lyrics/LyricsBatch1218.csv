Toots Camarata & His Orchestra,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear

Toots Camarata & His Orchestra,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2007

Toots Camarata & His Orchestra,"We're going through the impatient years
The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
And dreaming a dream people say is wrong

But we'll journey through the impatient years
To each other's arms where we belong, clinging together
I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year
But we'll journey through the impatient years

To each other's arms where we belong, clinging together
I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year",The Impatient Years,2011
Toots Camarata & His Orchestra,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap

You're hand-in-hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap

Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap

Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight, and youll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
Its too late now; there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap,2011
Toots Camerata,"River it like to flow
Eagle it like to fly
Eagle it like to feel
Its wings against the sky

Possum it like to run

When the world was an onion

Toots Camerata,"It's that ole devil called love game
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shock again
Put a ring in my eyes
Tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart

It's that sly ole sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that ring
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

Suppose I didn't stay and ran away
Wouldn't play
That devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do

Toots Thielemans,"Sei calda come i baci che ho perduto
Sei piena di un amore che a passato
Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Odio l'estate
Il sole che ogni giorno ci saldava
Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva
Addeso brucia solo con furor

Tornerà un altro inverno
Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve coprirà tutte le cose
E forse un po' di pace tornerà

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Toots Thielemans,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1990
Toots Thielemans,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.

All that winter we shared a cold
Drank all the orange juice

Toots Thielemans,"Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey

Lived a most concerned young boy
He said lately I have noticed
Folks don't live with peace and joy

With frowns and worry on their faces
They're lost and don't know where to go
He said I'll get the people straightened
By putting on a puppet show

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they'd listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

First he carved out young Abe Lincoln
Abe will teach 'em civil rights
Then a king named Martin Luther
So they'd recall his peaceful fight

Old Mark Twain, his wit and wisdom
Will surely show them life is fun
But he smiled with satisfaction
When the prince of peace was done

Now his puppet shows were clever
And he made the people laugh
When he got across the message
To walk along life's open path

They built him his own puppet theater
Decked out with spotlights yellow and red
And then they wrote him up in all the papers
And this is what the story said

I could see, that girl was no good for me
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free

I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill; my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And, may I say, not in a shy way
No, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man? What has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2000

Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone

Toots Thielemans,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them

It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

Where ya gonna go

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows some holly and some mistletoe
Well, they help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies in his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two

We shared a kiss, we shared the dance
We shared the body and bouquet
And we'll taste the wine another day

Are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts and one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Hold up well in poems and in books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth

If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight

Drank all the orange juice

Tootsie,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,1993

Que ya no te importa mas de mi
Que el tiempo alado mio

Se atreve a comentar que yo no tengo dignidad que me tiene piedad

No no

Tal vez yo deba resignarme y no llamarte mas
Tal vez yo deba respetarme y no rogarte mas
Tal vez deba dejar con toda dignidad
Que vivas un romance en paz

No se si te das cuenta con el estúpido que estas
Yo se que no podrá quererte como yo
Que así no te amara jamas

Hustlin' my lyrics like drugs, I find it bug
Muthafuckas always gotta lock the safe but they don't do jay
But anyway, it's another day, another dollar to earn, more weed to burn

I learn, muthafuckas are jealous
Listenin' to what they tell us but don't matter what fellas
I figure this, niggas want Buck to get nigga-rich
Bigger miss, while I'm kickin' this

You miss, I can put you on the list, in the studio to make hits
'cause all it takes is a whip, for you to flip
Jock what I got, clock what I got
But you don't got what I got, watch the block

Listenin' to grill chill, make you feel like you wanna get in my shit
Sip my dick, do it straw what for, while you war wit war
War only make money for niggas who think, dummy
You got your window wide open like it's sunny outside
Sleep, nigga, boom bye bye

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in
The shot ti fly now that sound bwoy lie dead
Two shots dead to dem chin, enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to a muthafuckin' end

Listen to, me and you
Won On Won like Tek-N-Steele, fuck ya whole crew
Forty millimeter shells in the heater well
Look like ya niggas gotta be the first to bail

Just because ya niggas from jail, just came home
To flip, back up in the jail cell, to sit
And roam, now, I got a kite from my little nigga Cappone
Tellin' me the jail wars on

I know, I was listenin' to po-po
Tell 'em niggas it was on a long time ago
Gather up the firearms to bomb, ring the alarm
'cause shit get slippery and sweaty palms

So I gotta remain calm
Gather up my thoughts so I don't go wrong
Plan to move too smooth, you think you got me

Weak tar in copy, fake villain, who the fuck you killin'?
I'm willin' to bet, you think you in it but your street is still a vet
Slapped and tried, boom bye bye

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in
The shot ti fly now that sound bwoy lie dead
Two shots dead to dem chin, enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to a muthafuckin' end

Although when I come, I come abstract
Most people get it whenever they play it back
Black or book you read or a hook you said
BD get stuck up in ya head, say it in the bed

BD, BD, BD, up in ya zone, BD, BD, BD, breakin' ya bones
But no matter what, I never break into ya home
'cause your house is not a home, if you don't got chrome

Now, you follow me and you don't ask how
Well, as a leader, I'ma make you play the background
Mercenary but I'm merciless and when I bust, I bust to hit

Will lie in the mist and you hear it twist, of somebody cap
Steady bustin' in the front and got hit in the back
Thought it couldn't happen, just 'cause you was strappin'

Bullets hit the wind and descend to detonate, target chest plate
Blow up the earthquake, can't wait to demonstrate
The force of the one, two roll wit I
Sleep thought you slept, boom bye bye

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in
The shot ti fly now that sound bwoy lie dead
Two shots dead to dem chin, enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to a muthafuckin' end

Yeah!
It's all about you, one time!
I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
It's all about you, it's all about you, yeah
This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac you knowhat I'm sayin'? (It's all about you)
Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl
That it's all about you, you, you, you",All About U,1998
Top Dogg,"Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!

""Young G, about to set the fucking record straight""
Once upon a time, in the place to be
On the darkside of the see-P-T
There lived a Young G, rolling weed and smog
To make the story interesting it's me, the Top Dogg
(Cindafella!) I lived in a shack with my O.G. dad
And two big homies, who treated me bad
I cooked, and cleaned, and scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy running to the liquor store
The homies, they used to boast and brag,
""We got Chucks, and khakis that sag!""
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They used to have me smoke stress, while they had indo
The girls used to say, ""D, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them bell bottom suits""
Well, one day, on the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Compton crew
He said, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the ghetto princess""
Well I, ran home when I heard the whole speech
Bust through the door, straight to my O.G.
And I said, ""O.G., may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cindafella!)
I got so mad, mad enough to blast
Even Pops was aiming for a piece of that ass (Cindafella!)
They haunted, they flaunted, they knew what I wanted
""We goin' get some hoochies,"" that's what they taunted
They laughed and joked, they hated on me
They didn't want to see me fucking up the M-I-see
So they left the crib, with a smile on they face
And as they stepped out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

[Chorus]
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
(Cindafella plays the game!) Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!

Now I'm standin all alone, I just got dissed
I'd smoke them all if I had one wish
But before I make my thought a phrase
There appeared the G in a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Suge
I'm your gangsta Godfather, it's all to the good
Now I came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Suge, what's popping dog? Just put me down with the Row
And I know that I can handle these hoes for sure""
He waved a Cuban cigar, and before you know
My sacks of stress was an ounce of indo
My clothes transformed from rags to silk suits
And he transformed my hoopt' into a Lex Coupe
""But you must rock the mic by stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""

[Chorus]

Well I hit the hoochie ball at eleven o'clock
Too flossy for the princess so she started to jock
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
Hit the stage enraged and I started to rock
By eleven thirty-five, I was all in the cock (oh yeah!!)
All my homies was amazed that the bitch was mines
So I swooped to the Coupe at eleven fifty-nine
This story doesn't end with no fuckin glass shoes
All was left on the step was the rubber that I used

[Chorus: x2]

Cindafella! Cindafella!
Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
Cindafella! Cindafella!
Cindafella plays the game!
Cindafella! Cindafella! Show no shame!
Cindafella plays the game!
Cindafella! Cindafella plays the game!",Top Dogg Cindafella,1999

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

But it was long ago
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'
Against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

Well those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still runnin' against the wind
I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind
Well I'm older now and still runnin'
Against the wind

Still runnin'

I'm still runnin'
I'm still runnin' against the wind

Watch the young man run
Watch the young man runnin'

They'll be ridin' against the wind

Everything is fine

All alone, but that just soothes me
There's no urgency, I'm following the sun

Don't know really who I am

'Cause I'm where I wanna be
And it doesn't matter if I'm swallowed by the sky
'Cause I'm following the sun

Heading east, I'm looking skyward
Start to think that maybe I could
Reach the rising sun
And catch her when she falls

Toquinho,"Numa folha qualquer eu desenho um sol amarelo 
E com cinco ou seis retas é fácil fazer um castelo.
Corro o lápis em torno da mão e me dou uma luva, 
E se faço chover, com dois riscos tenho um guarda-chuva.

Se um pinguinho de tinta cai num pedacinho azul do papel, 
Num instante imagino uma linda gaivota a voar no céu.
Vai voando, contornando a imensa curva Norte e Sul, 
Vou com ela, viajando, Havai, Pequim ou Istambul. 
Pinto um barco a vela branco, navegando, é tanto céu e mar num beijo azul.

Entre as nuvens vem surgindo um lindo avião rosa e grená. 
Tudo em volta colorindo, com suas luzes a piscar.
Basta imaginar e ele está partindo, sereno, indo, 
E se a gente quiser ele vai pousar.

Numa folha qualquer eu desenho um navio de partida 
Com alguns bons amigos bebendo de bem com a vida.
De uma América a outra consigo passar num segundo,
Giro um simples compasso e num círculo eu faço o mundo. 

Um menino caminha e caminhando chega no muro 
E ali logo em frente, a esperar pela gente, o futuro está. 
E o futuro é uma astronave que tentamos pilotar,
Não tem tempo nem piedade, nem tem hora de chegar.
Sem pedir licença muda nossa vida, depois convida a rir ou chorar.

Nessa estrada não nos cabe conhecer ou ver o que virá.
O fim dela ninguém sabe bem ao certo onde vai dar. 
Vamos todos numa linda passarela 
De uma aquarela que um dia, enfim, descolorirá.

Pode ser mais mas sabe menos do que eu.
Porque a vida só se dá pra quem se deu, 
Pra quem amou, pra quem chorou, pra quem sofreu. 

Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão 
Nunca vai ter nada, não. 

Não há mal pior do que a descrença,
Mesmo o amor que não compensa 
É melhor que a solidão. 

Abre os teus braços, meu irmão, deixa cair.
Pra que somar se a gente pode dividir. 
Eu francamente já não quero nem saber 
De quem não vai porque tem medo de sofrer.

Ai de quem não rasga o coração,
Esse não vai ter perdão. 
Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão, 
Nunca vai ter nada, não.

É que os momentos felizes 
Tinham deixado raízes no seu penar. 
Depois perdeu a esperança 
Porque o perdão também cansa de perdoar.

Tem sempre o dia em que a casa cai,

Você pode estar certo que vai chorar.

Pode ser mais mas sabe menos do que eu.
Porque a vida só se dá pra quem se deu, 
Pra quem amou, pra quem chorou, pra quem sofreu. 

Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão 
Nunca vai ter nada, não. 

Não há mal pior do que a descrença,
Mesmo o amor que não compensa 
É melhor que a solidão. 

Abre os teus braços, meu irmão, deixa cair.
Pra que somar se a gente pode dividir. 
Eu francamente já não quero nem saber 
De quem não vai porque tem medo de sofrer.

Ai de quem não rasga o coração,
Esse não vai ter perdão. 
Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão, 
Nunca vai ter nada, não.

Só se esquece no perdão

Ah, minha amada, me perdoa
Pois embora ainda te doa

Eu te suplico não destruas
Tantas coisas que são tuas
Por um mal que já paguei

Da tristeza que há nas preces
Que a chorar te faço eu

E com cinco ou seis retas é fácil fazer um castelo.
Corro o lápis em torno da mão e me dou uma luva, 
E se faço chover, com dois riscos tenho um guarda-chuva.

Se um pinguinho de tinta cai num pedacinho azul do papel, 
Num instante imagino uma linda gaivota a voar no céu.
Vai voando, contornando a imensa curva Norte e Sul, 
Vou com ela, viajando, Havai, Pequim ou Istambul. 
Pinto um barco a vela branco, navegando, é tanto céu e mar num beijo azul.

Entre as nuvens vem surgindo um lindo avião rosa e grená. 
Tudo em volta colorindo, com suas luzes a piscar.
Basta imaginar e ele está partindo, sereno, indo, 
E se a gente quiser ele vai pousar.

Numa folha qualquer eu desenho um navio de partida 
Com alguns bons amigos bebendo de bem com a vida.
De uma América a outra consigo passar num segundo,
Giro um simples compasso e num círculo eu faço o mundo. 

Um menino caminha e caminhando chega no muro 
E ali logo em frente, a esperar pela gente, o futuro está. 
E o futuro é uma astronave que tentamos pilotar,
Não tem tempo nem piedade, nem tem hora de chegar.
Sem pedir licença muda nossa vida, depois convida a rir ou chorar.

Nessa estrada não nos cabe conhecer ou ver o que virá.
O fim dela ninguém sabe bem ao certo onde vai dar.

É melhor ser alegre que ser triste
Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe
É assim como a luz no coração

Mas pra fazer um samba com beleza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
Senão, não se faz um samba não

Senão é como amar uma mulher só linda
E daí? Uma mulher tem que ter
Qualquer coisa além de beleza
Qualquer coisa de triste
Qualquer coisa que chora
Qualquer coisa que sente saudade

Uma beleza que vem da tristeza
De se saber mulher
Feita apenas para amar
Para sofrer pelo seu amor
E pra ser só perdão

Tor Erik Hermansen,"27th of January, think he died a year ago today
She's crying on my shoulder and begging me to make the hurting go away
Pretty brown eyes, tears full of guilt, a heart full of pain and fear
I wanna tell her it's okay but we both know she's the reason he's not here.

I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all (seem to help at all)
With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls
And I would (and I would) 
If I could (if I could, but the try would be in vain 
(The try would be in vain)
Said so matter what I do, I can't stop the rain.
So I cry

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't stop the rain (stop the rain) [Repeat: x2]
If I could, you know I would, but the try would be in vain.
So I cry
Oh, I can't stop the rain (stop the rain)

Faded picture in a little gold locket, and she never takes it off
I know it's small, but it's heavy 'cus it's filled with guilt
I know and she why his life is lost
I feel bad for her, but I'm having mixed emotions
Cause he was a friend of mine
Somewhere in the deepest darkest part of my mind
I wish it was her that died that night

I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all (seem to help at all)
With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls (raindrop falls)

One rainy Saturday night, a happy anniversary
Celebrating long, champagne all around
They had a little too much to drink
They got in the car, and he could barely stand up
So she figured that she'd drive.
Staring at him I suppose, a sudden jerk of the wheel,
And the car flipped about three times

I keep on crying, but it doesn't seem to help at all.
With every single tear drop, it's like another raindrop falls [raindrop falls].
And I would [and I would], if I could (if I could) but the try would be in vain.
Said so matter what I do (what I do) I can't stop the rain.

Tor Erik Hermansen,"Don't remember were we met (All I do know) 
Is that I said hi and she looked me up and down 
(And she said lets go) 
So we went to a spot, out the back, blazin' hot
Clothes come off, it was on, head board broke. Mine was blown. After the session she checked her messages on her cell. All of a sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as hell. The message said hey baby, surprise surprise, girl I'm free. I'll be home around 3. But it was already 3:15.

(Hurry up) 
Grab your clothes

Disappear 
(Hurry up) 
Gotta get outta here 
Baby, he's crazy
Believe me he'll kill you 
Leave your number 
I'll call you 
Whatever you just need to 
Just leave 

She said he stood about seven foot nine 
Killed some cat for looking at her and got twenty five to life
And somehow he's out today,and this fool he's on his way
He'll snap your neck and not think twice 
Get your things and goodnight 
Now I ain't trippin, 'cause if there ain't no man I like, I feel 
So I am dragging around ever so slowly
Puttin on my gear, I grab my jeans, off the floor 
And I hear keys in the door
She changes the locks that bought me time
But still this dude is right outside. 
And she said... 

[Chorus:]

She said get under the bed, likes that's a good place to hide 
H kicked in the door, no hello.He just said who's car is that outside.
I looked at him, he looked at me 
I still had one leg out my jeans
Where do I go running through my head, I guess I should've listened when she said

Tor Miller,"Jeff Buckley's grace was playing loud as hell
In a back of an old dive bar
So I step outside and light a cigarette
Taking the fumes of the passing cars
Loud angry drunks and a few crest punks
Fill every crevasse of Saint Mark's
Some things have changed since back then
But the streets are still so hard

In the lonely hours of midnight
When New York City's lying wide awake
Under the glow of street light
I feel the rumble that the concrete makes
On my head, lookout down
Ride through the Harlem to the interstate
Let my soul reignite
In the lonely hours of midnight

Two lovers falling in each other's arms
Stumbling  on down the high line
Upon the bridge there's a broken heart
Screaming to his valentine
Two sunken eyes at the corner shop
Tryina get a lucy for a dime
The needle drops and the line it turns
And then it burns one right

In the lonely hours of midnight
When New York City's lying wide awake
Under the glow of street light
I feel the rumble that the concrete makes
On my head, lookout down
Ride through the Harlem to the interstate
Let my soul reignite
In the lonely hours of midnight

Calling out for something
Calling out for something true

Calling out for something
Calling out for something true

Tor Miller,"He started selling drugs for the money
Putting some to the side
Getting all fucked up on your own supply
Riding with the same group of guys
We used to hide away from
And I was so caught up
Tryna make it instead
That I cut you off just to get ahead
Scared that you were dragging me
Deeper down into the mud

Woah oh!
What have we Become
Cause you and I both could have
Whatever we wanted
But we were two punk kids
Though the costs were always fronted
Our growth was only stunted
Knowing we would always be picked back up
And I watched you
As you turned your back to our class
Embarrassed by the money
That our folks had
Man, I was too
But I only tried to strengthen the sum

And I always sit
Where we used to rest
Smoke cigarettes
And watch the sun set
Over our town
And the plans that we laid
As we fade, as we fade

And I don't really know where we should start
We were so damn different and born to drift apart
Maybe all we had in common
Was a love for the drugs
But I can still feel you pushing
Pushing down on my chest
As I cross my arms
And force my last breath
We were always willing to risk the blackout
For a shot at the buzz

And I always sit
Where we used to rest
Smoke cigarettes
And watch the sun set
Slow to the ground
Casting our shade
As we fade, as we fade

You're probably drunk
At the local bar
On a Wednesday afternoon
With the same old faces
That never had the guts to move
And I live back in my parents' house
With no clue what to do
Maybe quit the dream
And pick back up the school

And I always sit
Where we used to rest
Smoke cigarettes
And watch the sun set
And I hit you up
To see how you've been
You say you've been better
But you want to hang again
Though we both know
That promises made
Only fade, only fade
Only fade",Fade,2018

Only concerned with getting drunk
And took all our privilege and all of the money

Way to serious for twenty-one

Who's she to say when we're hiding from

I go see my friends
Like nothing is wrong
I'd rather hurt myself
Than try and be strong
Fitting myself in somewhere
I don't belong

Tor Miller,"I've been stretching truth
And I’ve been living lies
I can tell you anything but what's really on my mind
I think it’s crazy how much I choose to hide
From someone who’s known me best for the longest time
I see you glisten
The shining in your eyes
Either from what's in your solo cup or what I'm 'bout to bring to light
And the music was pulled out from the plug

Oh but it’s too late, and oh it’s just begun

And the cost is something I’m not accustomed to

And I hate to have to make you choose
But we can’t pretend
We can’t go back to how it was before you knew

And nothing but a joke
And there’s a third one
Which I hope is true
That somewhere deep inside you can feel it too
Please don't freeze up and reach out for your phone
But give me something real to know I'm not alone
You can kiss me, decide to up and run
Or you can say you have no clue where I was coming from

I would like it to be known when I'm gone
And my zone and desire and my tone might have grown
But I've never been a clone
Ain't never been condoned, together or alone
Every sentence that I've shown, respectfully my own
Niggas check for me
Write a check for me you'll be gone
This is chess not checkers so I'm checkin' for the throne
I ain't checkin' for the stones in your necklace and zircones
Or moissanite, I'll destroy the mic for my goal
More than likely, you ain't know
You might be in the pros thinkin' you Mike
And more like Ronnie Seikaly with the flow
This is precisely the show
The pros from the amateurs
Niggas did no flash of the cannon, don't mean the camera
Still The Sun Rise In The East, Jeru Da Damaja
Came Clean, My Mind Spray, that Mental Stamina
Been a problematic and panoramic parameters
No need for cross examining

For the record, I am not for the fuckery
Lame niggas luckily, have stayed out of my lane
Was slain, what you gonna be
Doubt if you want to be
Known as the first rapper bodied to use a fucking Bugatti as a hearse
But you might
I ain't really trying to listen to what you like
Put a lesson in my lyrics that'll glisten in your light
My position is precise
The middle is what I like
Taking lyrical and literal, I'm lyrically right
Analytically ignite, recite for the payoff
My pen had been problematic since Agallah was 8-Off
You thinkin' of assassinating my character, you way off
Last attempt, when Shawn Kemp was in the playoffs
Hate talking water guns when I mention a spray off
But you can get Super Soaked when I'm letting the K off
My daily scheme is to get the cream like Bernie Madoff
And only Ferris Bueller get the day off

I start scoping over next door
I carve open from the deck, whoever should want to step

What's the connect, Tor who got that dope?
The shit playing, what, y'all ain't know?
Still spit that potent bars laced with that arsenic
Pinning that authentic lyrical awesomeness

Know what the God in it, I give em 40 to flood them out
And double up on double D's before the drought
You cut a rug, I cut a scene and cut you out
And based on the cut of your jeans, you cut a gown

These clowns is cut-arounds, but you know where they cut it from
The blueprint of the written sentence is one to one
You one and done, ain't nothing come to try the
Jerry Bruckheimer of the rhymers, remind the

If memory serves then I've been on my Arthur
Asheing for the cash, know I'm gripped like a halter
Back to my react like the scripts is on the wall
Packed to run the track like it's hitting off the arm

We're giving them the heron, the calm before the storm
The timer before the bomb, a hundred stacks in the palm
The 23rd and the Psalms, the Lord is your Sheppard
And you shall not want the God stomp on the record

Recorded by the legions with Jesus hovering
Warrin' with your Caesar, fade who we ducking it
Call 'em how we sees 'em, measure the applause
Lines over lines, 11 on the floor

So whoever want a war, take twenty paces and draw
But better be Basquiat to the core
I paint pictures in Pro Tools, shine on the track with no jewels
A breath of fresh air like O2

If it ever approach you, however get close to
The flow handle like burnt spoons and ropes do
The brave one is the same one that will start wrong
Pull your heart out the chest like Comme des Garçons

Comprende cabrón, on that Rosetta Stone
Bilingual better flow, porque I let 'em know
Sky and Tor, the stanza's 4 on 4
Doing the most and they still want more, maricóns

In the sweat suit, I'm ready to check niggas

Might see me with the Mac, but it ain't make up, yo
I make up flows, cake up and make up mo'
I stay low so that Jake don't go
Bay Bro is he tank, time to make sure that the street straight
Locked it down on a release date
Buried the B-brake, heavy on the beat till the beat-brake
Bag a bad bitch then be great, double with tandras
Battle brothers that battle with monsters

We body a rock star in broad daylight
Tell 'em rock-a-by baby, till they all get the concept

Chip off the old block, a great shot
From right here, I can pick off yo whole block
Pick up my old knot. My pocket is a dead president
Dead cemetery, I get you buried, and the still pistol carried
It goes without sayn, sprayn the niggas that change clothes
Use the key word with one of my main hoes
Then I had to dumb her and grind it all summer
Your front run has turned hand bumpers?
My gun's slumkin', and leave you in the slum dunkin'
My understanding is zero, tryna play a hero?
I point a Desert Eagle at yo ego
That's just me tho
Squeeze the hammer when I see a vandal
And beat enamel off his teeth with the heater handle
Fuck around and violate the squad Imma buck 'em down

Shovel's worth and I'm butter's worth on a shootin' spree
Sharp shooters, part shooters, move the seas, get it?
Shovel's worth, part the seas
Jesus, are we even aimed at the same dot?
Thrown for the great, I'll cook you a straight swap
Man down, cootoes, you know, you stand up with me
You standin' next to a Pharrell like a Hugo
For this new wave, this all swingin' for mine
I was probably hit yo mom's, impended your rhymes
I can't lie, if you see me in and outta yo place
I should have stuck with my gut and let it rot on her face

Torch,"Ich hörte schon im Kindergarten, Leute zu mir Nigga sagen
Grad wenn man für etwas steht, erfährt man sehr oft Niederlagen
Wollte nie 'n Prediger sein, eher 'n Aufklärer
Wollte mich nicht boxen, ich war eher so der Lautsprecher
Wuchs auf, fremd im eigenen Land, kein Ausländer
Schrieb drinnen Texte, hoffte, dass sich was da draußen ändert
Aber die Texte werden jährlich aktueller
Ich will, dass mich Leute hören, deshalb rap ich Acapella, wuh
Schwarzer Panter wie T'Challa in Wakanda, Brothers Keepers
Scheint wir kriegen keinen Obama, ich will Torch als Bundeskanzler
Und fick H&M, Handelsembargo, Frieden für alle Farben
Ein Remix für Adriano

Yeah, woo, jau, woo

Das geht eins, zwei, drei, let's go

Jetzt ist die Zeit, hier ist der Ort
Hier, heute ist die Nacht, Torchmann hat das Wort
Denk' ich an Deutschland in der Nacht
Bin ich um meinen Schlaf gebracht
Mein Bruder Adriano wurde umgebracht
Hautfarbe, schwarz, Blut, rot, Schweigen ist Gold
Gedanken sind tiefblau
Ein Bürger hat Angst vor seinem Volk
Ein Wintermärchen aus Deutschland, blauer Samt
Als Kind schon erkannt, hier bin ich fremd im eigenen Land
Operation Artikel 3, da habt ihr gelacht
Jungs, das ist mein Leben, das ha'm wir uns nicht ausgedacht
In all den Jahren in denen wir Airplay verschwendet haben
Man könnte denken, wir Rapper hätten nichts zu sagen
Doch es rächt sich, ihr werdet sehen, es holt uns ein
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein (oh, oh)
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (yeah)
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende
Was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Ich rapp' für meinen Bruder, denn ich könnte auch das Opfer sein
Falscher Ort, falsche Zeit, da hilft dir auch nicht tapfer sein
Wie viel Blut muss fließen in innerdeutschen Krisen
Alter, schau die letzen Jahre haben das mir zu oft bewiesen
Dass die Menschen sich erheben, wenn die Leute nicht mehr leben
Doch dann ist es zu spät, ihr solltet öfters drüber reden
Also, wie ist das möglich? Manchmal ist es doch tödlich
Gerechtigkeit, denn nicht nur Adriano hat es nötig

Zu viele Promis machen politische Promo-Gigs
Ich hoff' der Track hier ist 'n Dildo, der die Zone fickt
Ich will nix mehr erzählen zum Nationalbefreien
Ich sage K, sage Z, sage Nazis rein
Ich will nicht labern, denn ich kenn' mein Vaterland
Macht es mich krank wie Masern, dann verspür ich Tatendrang
Ich fühle mich eingeengt und will statt Prominenz
Und statt großer Fans, Nazis, die wie Poster hängen

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung (woo)
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung (ja, Mann)
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt (ah)
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (yeah)
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende
Und was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände (ah)
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Zuviel ungereimte Scheiße, nicht genug Protest
Rechter Terror wird verharmlost so wie Schulhofstress
Trotz Beweisen, Wahrheitsfindung bleibt ein Suchprozess
Keine Gerechtigkeit beim NSU-Prozess
Zu viele, die immer wieder weggesehen haben
Keiner redet hier gerne von echten Fehlern
Rechte Politik gefällt den rechten Wählern
Rechte Polizisten helfen rechten Tätern
Rechte Zellen in unserm Heer kommen nicht von ungefähr
Wehrmachtsveteranen starteten die Bundeswehr
Für viele ist das nur Geschichte und nicht mehr
Die alten Geschichten interessieren die Jungen nicht mehr
Sie sagen, „Reg dich ab, lass es hinter dir“
Aber wenn der Fremdenhass nicht endet, was beginnt dann hier?
Und wie erzieh ich mein Kind dann hier?
Asylantenheime brennen noch immer hier, was

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (okay)
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende
Und was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung

And I'll go chasin' the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in Strawberry Fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch

Oo who
The time is getting closer
Oo who
Time to be a ghost
Oo who
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we been

So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearin' my naughties like a jewel
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
And then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still an angel to a girl who hates to sin

Oo who
The time is getting closer
Oo who
Time to be a ghost
Oo who
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who I've been

Or will I see you dear and wish I could come back
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see

Oo who
The time is getting closer
Oo who
Time to be a ghost
Oo who
Every day we're getting closer

Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces

We danced in graveyards with vampires 'till dawn
We laughed in the faces of king never afraid to burn

And I hate disintegration
Watching us wither
Black winged roses that safely changed their color

I'm still up and driving can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction 'cause they'll soon know where I live
And I want to live
Got a full tank and some chips

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
And I sang Holly Holy as he buttoned down his pants

You can laugh
It's kind of funny
Things you think
Times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this
Yes I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread for you, your friends
Your father, Mr. Ed

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this

And I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back used to hang
And he said it's your choice babe just remember
I don't think you'll be back in three days time so you choose well
Tell me what's right
Is it my right to be on my stomach of Fred's Seville

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this

And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet

Pantyhose running in the cold

Mother the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Green limousine for the redhead dancing dancing girl
And when I dance for him
Somebody leave the light on
Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from

I walked into your dream
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream
You are the clever one aren't you
Brides in veils for you
We told you all of our secrets
All but one
And don't you even try
The phone has been disconnected
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice
Poison me against the moon

Mother the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Black chariot for the redhead dancing dancing girl
He's gonna change my name
Maybe you'll leave the light on
Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from

I escape into your escape into our very favorite fearscape
It's across the sky and across my heart and I cross my legs oh my God
First my left foot then my right behind the other
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow

With a ring with some snowman's

To take me by the hand 
Through an elevator 
Gotta a little red light 
That tells you, boy 
Where the razor's been

You can turn that violator 
You'll finally be that woman, yes 
Finally be that woman 
That's been frozen in the pretty silver girl 
Yes 

And I've never seen blue 
Like the blue she drives 
In and around 
And through me again 
I said I've never seen eyes 
Like the blue she drives 
In and around 
And through me again 
Through me again 
Through me again 

Some boy you are 
To wear my color red 
To wear it very proudly 
And wear it like a lady 
Knows how to cross her legs 
Where the birdy's been 

I've never seen blue 
Like the blue she drives 
In and around 
And though me again 
Said I've never seen eyes

Who could ever harm you

But the hangman isn't hangin' 
And they put you on the street

In a room with your two-timer

That you're not a gambling man 
Then you find you're back in Vegas 
With a handle in your hand 
Your black cards will make you money 
So you hide them when you're able 
In the land of milk and honey 
You must put them on the table

I've cried a thousand oceans.

Sail you home.

But you know that I will run.
You know that I will follow you
Over Silbury Hill,
Through the solar field.
You know that I will follow you.

And if I find that you
Still remember
Playing at trains,
Or does this little blue ball
Just fade away?

Through the solar field, 
You know that I will follow you.
I'm aware what the rules are,
But you know that I will run.
You know that I will follow you.

Made of you but not enough of you

Tori Amos,"I took a taxi form LA to Venus 
In 1985 I was electromagnetically sucked 
Back into a party going on that night 
It was the gory of the 80s with karma drawn up in lines 
And two Bugle Boy models saying ""baby it's a freebie 
You sure look deprived."" I had the 
Story of O in my bucket seat 
Of my want to be mustang 
Auditioning for reptiles in their 
Raquel Welsh campaign 
In the glories of the 80's you said 
""I'm not afraid to die"" I said 
I don't find that remotely funny, even 
On this space cake high 
And then when it all seemed clear 
Just then you go and disappear 
Silicone party babies to the left 
And Joan of Arcs to the right 
No one feeling insecure 
We were all gorge and famous in our last lives 
In the glories of the 80's you said 
""the end is nothing to fear"" I said 
Blow the end 
Now baby who do I gotta shag to get outta here 
And then when it all seemed clear 
Just then you go and disappear 
Sure you're out there orbiting around 
Wish I had you back now 
I met a drag king called venus 
She had a velvet hologram she said 
""My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am"" 
In the glories of the 80's 
I may not have to die 
I'll clone myself like that blonde chick 
That sings Bette Davis eyes and then

Just then 
You go and disappear",Glory of the 80's,1999
Tori Amos,"Not tonight josephine. 
In an army's strength therein 
Lies the denouement. From 
Here you're haunting me. By 
The Seine so beautiful, only 
Not to be of use, impossible. 
So strange, victory, 1200 spires 
The only sound, moscow burning. 
Empty like the Tuileries. Like a dream 
Vienna seems, only not to be of use- impossible. 
In the last extremity, to 
Advance or not to advance, I 
Hear you laughing 
Even still you're calling me 
""not tonight, not tonight

Tori Amos,"Take your mind back- I don't know when-
Sometime when it always seemed to be just us and them.
Girls that wore pink, boys that wore blue,
Boys that always grew up better men than me and you.
What's a man now, what's a man mean?
Is he rough- or is he rugged, cultural and clean?
Now it's all changed- it's got to change more.
We think it's getting better, but nobody's really sure.

And so it goes, go round again,
But now and then we wonder who the real men are 

See the nice boys dancing in pairs,
Golden earring, golden tan, blow-wave in the hair-
Sure they're all straight, straight as a line.
All the guys are macho, see their leather shine.
You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend,
So don't call me a faggot, not unless you are a friend.
Then if you're tall, handsome and strong,
You can wear the uniform and I could play along.

And so it goes, go round again,
But now and then we wonder who the real men are 

Time to get scared, time to change plan,
Don't know how to treat a lady, don't know how to be a man.
Time to admit, what you call defeat,
'Cause there's women running past you now-
And you just drag your feet.
Man makes a gun, man goes to war,
Man can kill, and man can drink, and man can take a whore.
Kill all the blacks, kill all the reds,
If there's war between the sexes then there'll be no people left.

And so it goes, go round again,
But now and then we wonder who the real men are 
And so it goes, go round again,

Immersed in his sepia

And I have let you eat from the fruits of my tree
I am not the one to turn into a Laurel wreath

When there can be no winners
The soul has been lost
Of the bow and quiver
Do you remember
Well I remember
Amid the clashing of swords
I'm losing you in my rear view
And I have called the Shekhina in
And the ninefold and a few other friends

If the cubs were drawn in

Cross my line

Of those I am derated

When we went with my friends
To the Eden parties

And Sister Ernestine was dancing on the cube

I'm attracted to the botox
That makes me sexy and sexy again
And to all my surgeons staff

Bad times
When I could move my face in all the directions
Please smile just when you have not other options
My doctors said. And I did
Mary Magdalene went on extreme makeover (over over)
And now she makes a show in saint Marie de la mer (mer mer)
And I'm just attracted but so attracted girls again to sin
That's my profession

They live in mushrooms, the new sin symbols
And where the smurfette's forced to sell her
But how
Said how

They forced you to submit your soul

To make something out of himself

Tori Amos,"Our language of love
The Battle of Trees
We fought side by side
No one had more

Sharper consonants than you, love
And my vowels, well, were trusted

First comes the Birch
Rowan followed by the Ash
Then through the Alder she forms
And merges with Willow

The Hawthorne blossoms
As the Oak guards the door
She is the hinge on which the year swings
He courts the lightning flash and her

Summoning the spirits
Through incantations
You said the Thunder God seems to have
And our enemies are the Reed
But we knew the Furies held the Holly sacred

We were insulated
In a circle of words we'd drawn
With wisdom sent from nine Hazels
A Rowan fire and a Willow rod

At ten comes the vine
That generates bramble wine
The constant change of the night sun
A song in the blood of the white bull

Our language of love
The Battle of Trees
We fought side by side
No one had more

Sharper consonants than you, love
And my vowels, well, were trusted

From Ivy leaves is an ale that can unveil
The hidden meanings and serpents
Only revealed through visions
Yes vowels could insert
""A"" was for the Silver Fir

The Firs of course
Then came next
With Heather at her most
Passionate

The White Poplar's gift to the souls of the dead
A promise that it was not the end
But for the vine the ""U"", its coffer

Vowels and consonants
The power of trees
The power they hold
The power of prose

So when the church
Began to twist the old myths
They built their own Tower of Babel
From Ulster to Munster

The Reed gave way then
To the Elder
The Earth turns her will
So that night follows day

From dawn to dawn
From Winter to Winter
At day the Ash had power over the Alder

Our language of love
The Battle of Trees
We fought side by side

A remembering how we made it that

If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
Clocks are black

That's it you're done.
You've screwed up your life
Before it's begun
There are those who say
I am now too old to play

See over there at 33 she fears she'll lose her job
Because they hear the ticking of her clock
At only 15 I said 15, they say her future's bleak
She should have started this at 3

As her heart is slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of her mind
She'll get over it you say in time
In time? Stop Father Time

A remembering how we made it that

Catch the laughter from her eyes

Pouring them a pint

And he'll look you in the eye

To be only partially a boy that's made out of clay
We're all made out of clay

Through a window in the dark, there he sits all alone

He's been waiting on his selkie to come back

He said, I know these shores are not like yours
But will you make your home in my arms?

Hiding behind rocks to learn if he found a new love

Lorelei sings the song for lovers who were torn apart then left broken-hearted
Lorelei hears the cry of lovers that the sea of fate had separated

There inside his cabinet, folded safe her seal skin

From the Devil’s lair

And licking at her heels

When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

It's been a while since I last dreamt
Barely remember what it's like to dream
Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed
And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me
Pretend shit doesn't get to me
And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting
A man's problems are his own
And it's my burden
Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep
But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working
I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering
Sick of pretending to be so happy
All the while my anxiety's away at me
My skin crawling, I look up to the sky
And it falls, the walls close in and it's
As if all the good in my life disappears
In an instant, that thing is just so distant
So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me
But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me
It's just me, wish I could let somebody in
But I ain't ever been too trusting

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I've barely had any sleep when I get up
Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors
Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better
Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if
It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew
Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?
But the point of things I never have went from
Being a reason for the things that I do
To just being an excuse that I'd use
I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do
Find something other than negativity for my fuel
But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered
I hide everything that's going on inside
Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help
But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK
But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness
Is hard and depression is a slippery slope
I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though
So I carry on even though it's hard to
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change
As long as you give em a chance to

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

(Can you sing me a last lullaby?)

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married? We'll say: No man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kid is knockin' him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry be happy now

Don't worry
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Don't worry, 'cause we're walking in a winter wonderland",Winter Wonderland/Don't Worry Be Happy,2014

You got a girlfriend and stuff, feelings are bottled up

In a house full of a memories is where I lived

Come taste the sunsweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you

The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other

A diciannove invece i tour coi Sottotono e ora

Ma che grande Tiziano ricordi?
Momenti che per molti sono morti e sepolti
Se invece con dolcezza alla memoria li riporti
Vanno persi solo quando te ne scordi
Se pensi solo ai soldi, cosa ti resta?
Tra le mani di una vita vissuta di fretta
Rischi di perdere la testa ed è finita la festa
Vuoi una vita rock’n’roll ma ci rimetti la cresta

How does it feel

To say goodbye

To all the times we had before

Guess it don't matter

It don't matter anymore


If you're ever in Eastern Passage

You'd better not come knockin' on my door

'cause it don't matter

Time, lord give me some time

To rid my head of these things I can't ignore

Like your fists poundin' on my door


All I want some piece of mind to help me get through

Oh, it don't matter,

There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in",Skim,2017
Torres,"I got hard in your car
In the parking lot of the Masonic lodge

We lined the Hudson with our tangents
You trusted me to love your parents
Sunk into my tunnel vision
Sunk into my tunnel vision

I hope that's what you'll remember
Not how I left but how I entered
Who didn't know I saw three futures
One alone and one with you
And one with the love I knew I'd choose

You got me loaded on bergamot perfume
Downstairs in the TV room
You, you laid the plans and I was quiet

My eyes are trinity divided
My eyes are trinity divided

I hope what you will remember
Is not how I left but how I entered
And not the hope that I abused
If remembering's something you do

You didn't know I saw three futures
You didn't know I saw three futures

One alone and one with you
And one with the love I knew I'd choose",Three Futures,2017
Torres,"Where would I have been if
Not safe in the middle
Pressed between
His right shoulder
Your left shoulder
Drowsy on the ski lift
Drowsy on the ski lift

To be given a body
Is the greatest gift
Though the jar lifts and the jar descends
Though the morning glory withers
Before it begins
Though all creation groans

Every Sunday morning
He'd wake me with a whistle
Rolled me in a sheet
I swung towards you
I swung towards him
Laugh till I can't breathe
Laugh till I can't breathe

To be given a body
Is the greatest gift
Though the jar lifts and the jar descends
Though the morning glory withers
Before it begins
Though all creation groans",To Be Given a Body,2017
