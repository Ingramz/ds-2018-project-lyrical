Stephen Marley,"Wanna see my past
Look at my face
You see them pains from yesterday
Look at my face

Wanna see my face
Look at my face
Was an honest face
Look at my face

And this morning
Feels so close to the past
For just yesterday
You were left in the dark

Yeah and the dem oppression 
Of them chains
Still weighs on my brain

Can you see what I'm saying
Look at my pain 
You see them pains from yesterday 
Look at my face

You wanna see my face
Look at my face
Was I born free, 
Was I born a slave
Look at my face

With the whip on your mind
And your mind leads 
Your soul astray

And you can see that today 
You are all just some
Murdered slaves

'Cause you been thinking
That slavery is just from 
The nation's past
That's the puppet masters game

Can you see what I'm saying
Look at my pain 
You see them pains from yesterday 
Look at my face

You wanna see my face
Look at my face
Was I born free, 
Was I born a slave
Look at my face

Look at my pain
You see them pains from yesterday
Look at my face

You wanna see my face
Look at my face
Was I born free, 
Was I born a slave
Look at my face

And this morning
Feels so close to the past
For still yet today 
We are slaves in our yards

And the dem oppression 
Of them chains
Still weighs on my brain

Should I sing it together
Look at my pain
You see them pains from yesterday
Look at my face

You wanna see my face
Look at my face
Was I born free, 
Was I born a slave
Look at my face

Look at my pace
I'll forever come 
From yesterday
Look at my pace, yeah yeah",Old Slaves,2011
Stephen Marley,"And she be sorrow tomorrow
Cos she know now what the next day will bring
She's crying for joy weeping in silence
Cos she know now what the next day will bring
Cos she know now what the next day will bring

Never let a woman tell you that she loves you
When she don't really care that much
Why man why man why man

Never tell woman that you love her
When you don't really care that much for her
She cryin cryin cryin

And she be sorrow tomorrow
Cos she know now what the next day will bring
She's crying for joy weeping inside

Cos she know now what the next day will bring

She feeling as if she lost
Now she pay the cost
She's where we",She Knows Now,2011

Stephen Marley,"I've been a stranger to myself
I've felt alone like no one else
I've seen the good suffer long
I've felt the power of love
I've made a way out, flew where to go
And what's it all for? I don't know
But it must be said, just so you know

That it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
The sun rises and rises and rise s
It'll rise again

I've caught a glimpse of her, beautiful
I've come to learn pain teaches more than hurt
Some come to the end of the world 
Just to wake up and be reborn
I've seen the weak overcome the strong
And what's it all for? Only Jah knows
But no matter how this life unfolds yeah

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Inna fields of marijuana that is my playground
I love you, Mary J
You're the prettiest of flowers
Girl, me can't complain
When I'm with you, I feel so high, I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And if them lonely, feeling only pain
'Cause, your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

And she never force-ripe, it was a real slow speed

No cross pollination, she's a real pure breed
Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need

Yeah
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Far away (with Stephen Marley!)
Yeah!

Soon I'll be coming home
Been around the world like a rolling stone
Seen the whole world wide through my own eyes
Been a long time coming
A million miles and still running
Tryna find my way back
To my roots where the true thugs lay at
And I say that, ""I'm tryna go home
Take me somewhere that
My mind mode is on free
And my time zone is on freeze""
Everything stop!
I'm a need a little bit of time to get myself together
In the mean time I turn best to better
And in between time trying to be blessed forever
I hear home calling back for me

I think it's time I take a flight
To elevate my mind and make it my life
Been tryna get right
The big lights blinding me, they bright
I've been in darkness most my life
So I fight with all of my might
To make it back one day
Nigga someday it'll all work out someway

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day
Just give me one day

From the first of the month till the ruggish bone
Every week that crossroads stayed on the billboard
Baby said Wayne made up the word bling
Man I should've patented my whole damn flow
Sleep on a train tracks man it ain't so
Kray and I never had a place we could go
Walking around wondering were we ever 'gon blow
With a gun and our heart let all the wolves know

Buck buck tell my nigga stuck like chuck
100 to 5 I bet he never missed a lunch
Rainy day, hey nigga what about us?
Couldn't gone home, it was too fucked up
And my shoes fucked up but it's cool when it's rough
After that now we got more than enough
New black love two shooters and a glove
Easy upstairs to accompany me son

Tried to rob a little nigga but the talented one
Word to the widow and word to E' son
Still look young and these niggas ain't dumb
Cleveland is the city where the Bone Thugs come from
Come from, come from, never gonna run from
No, nuh, I need an a earthquake shown up
So all my niggas don't fall out

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day

Maybe I should come back home?

Stephen Marley,"There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And you're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grownups do
Let's do the things that grown folks do
Me and you

Grown folks likeness
Big old man heartless
Watch it make me not this
Experienced fatness
Love it on the liners
Gong to the Zilla
I'm a monsta like a Loch Ness
Look how long mi locks is
All bills paid, all bets made
House well clean, all bugs sprayed
Vacation tripping, she ain't tripping
Island skipping, fine wine sipping
Gourmet cooking, no Facebooking
Nothing to see 'cause she ain't looking
Tag team masseuses, D-Brown's music
Natural juices, so therapeutic
Lips on my earlobe, softer than a q-tip
Getting kinda stony, actin' kinda stupid
Pretendin' we're in highschool, kissing at the movies

So do you're grown an' sexy, baby 'cause your awesome
See some likkle young girls, don' beg dem no pardon
Teach 'em how to walk, welcome dem to stardom

There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow up
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And you're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grownups do
Let's do the things that grown folks do
Me, you

Early mornin' wake-up, springin' me the papers
Continental breakfast, smoked salmon an' capers
The eggs are over easy, you're puttin' on your makeup
We do some exercises, strolling through the acres
A mansion out in Gables, cottage in the Naples
Vineyards out in Bordeaux, horses in the stables
Baby we're connectedd, like TV is the cable
Like paper is to staple, like syrup is to maple
If Madonna's like a virgin, age is just a number
So tired of searching, gettin' weh my comfort
She feelin' kinda naughty, I'm feelin' kinda rumpish
She is my accomplice, we're gettin' things accomplished
Call ya by your last name, tell ya that your gorgeous
When I get around you I'm nervous till I'm nauseous
Tell me what's the holdup, baby 'cause I'm anxious
Both of us are grownups, drop your drawers to ankles

It's a lot of skinny young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow up
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And you're wishing one day you will soar

You create the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Oh you and I, a world apart
Please let me know if I have your heart
'Cause every time I'm with ya
You paint the perfect picture

This relationship, society can't relate
They say we're two opposites
They say it's all a mistake
They say I'm no good for you
They say you're too good for me
Them say the puzzle no fit
Well baby I disagree
Your mama told you to be
A very good behaving
And now just because of me
They say you're misbehaving
Daddy's not talking to you
Because he doesn't approve

No lies no truth, no truth no lies
Oh Jah is here, so I must abide
For you and I a world apart

We share the pains, we share the joy
'Cause every time I'm with ya

She said they taught her to love
And now they want her to hate
They say they're kicking her out
She told 'em she'd be okay
As long as she's loving me
She told 'em she'd be alright
She's so ready to live
She's excited for life
Is she reckless at all?
'Cause she won't leave me alone
She's always in my thoughts

Picture's as perfect can be
Every time she's with me

It's time for us to get closer now

For you and I a world apart
Please let me know if I have your heart
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Well baby it's you and me
We're painting portraits of love
Why won't they let us be free
I trust that God be the judge
They've never been so ashamed
We've never been so in love
I'd rather hold on to you
They'd rather hold on to blood
Jinx all the envy in them
It's always been you and I
They taught us live and let live
They'd rather live and let die
I pray they live to forgive
An' I say baby don't cry
'Cause when it's all said and done
An' man ah shed flesh an' bone
They won""t care who was wrong
They would wish you were home
It's remindin' me of a little story I know
It's like Lee and Molly or maybe Leah alone

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa I adore you
You're pretty like a picture
Baby love, you're my Mona Lisa

Stephen Mason,"I think I cracked my skull on the way down 
I think I lost my head when I lay down 
The fear of facts presented in the cold light of day 

I say the time has come for decision 
Better steer my boat for a reason 
Lost the way I went over horizon 
She went out of sight 
The girl lost me a lifetime 

Sometimes I feel, ['m washed up under] 
Sometimes I feel, [I'm washed up under]

I say the time has come for decision 
Better steer my boat for a reason 
Lost on the way I went over horizon 
She went out of sight 
The girl lost me a lifetime 

[Chorus: ]

[Repeat: 1st verse]

And when I step back from all this I see that I'm fighting 
I can't help myself, there's no reason for lying 
Truth and fiction they all become one 
Help me from the sea to the beach to the laaaaa
Sometimes I feel, I'm washed up under baby",Assessment,2004
Stephen Mason,"Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
I'm dysmorphic in doses
Imagine trying to
Shit out
Twelve red roses
It's how I do but not everybody knows it. 
Imagine how I'd feel to be called a promotionalist, a mitt man, an emotionalist.
When I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
It's some kind 
Psychosis, don't what you call it, oneness might be the closest.
A psychotropic segment so tasteless,
it tastes sweet.
And then it changes,
When I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you",Easy,2005

You see I fell from a spaceship I was taken for a little ride 
And I'd very much like to fall in love with you 
If you would if you would I'd like to know 
will you think of me when I'm gone? 

Sister live a long time I don't want to fight with you 
See my head's in a vice and I don't know who I am anymore 
And when I wake in the morning and I look through my window 
I see sun skies sand sea would you fill your heart with me 
If you would, I'd like to know 
will you think of me when I'm gone?

With the people that I love tonight

I tried to be alone
I tried to do my own thing, but 
the trouble with your own thing is
You end up on your own

Stephen McDonnell,"Bah Hum, No that's too strong!
'Cause it's my favorite holiday
But all this years been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from last year 
World tour, aeroplanes and babies. 
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of 98 was along those lines. 

So deck the halls and trim those trees
Raise up the cups of christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath 
Christmas with my mates this year

Calendar picture
Frozen landscape
Chill this room for twentyfour days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back to spring time, 
Sunny again
Would have been good to go for lunch 
Couldn't agree when we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch, 
We didn't of course till the summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him 
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonights the night but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it.

'Cause I bundled up too tight 
Last minutes have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls 
Because it's are S V P 
No thanks, no party lads 
It's christmas eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites 
Last fall I had a night to myself
Some guy called halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go 
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quite way I unwind, 
Doing christmas right this time

But I think I'll miss this one this year

Tesco has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot 
So it's on with the boots back out in the snow 
To the army all night garage but when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year
Spending this one alone he said
Give me a break this years been crazy 
I said me too, but why are you... 
You mean you forgot the papers too 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening
Christmas magic's brought this down to a very happy en-ending.

You sit there and I sit here
Looking at you used to be like looking in a mirror

It never ends like one expects

If I knew that I'd never had to write this song

But I just couldn't go on living on the brink

In hopes that we'll find one more chance

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Brought such a flame to me

And let it die

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe
She'd been drinking too much eggnog
And we begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof-prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back

Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Now we're all so proud of grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football
Drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts
Or send them back (send them back)

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched the hair on grandma's wig
I've warned all my friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves

These voices are taking the price
Of my life within reach of a butcher knife
You know how to kill them right

Regardless of what I say or what I sound like
I got a head full of murder and violence I can't control
And a mind full of voice that are telling me where to go
I'll end up in your bedroom with my hand around your throat
And what happens after that, well you know
Bodies obliterated, chopped up, incinerated
Not a single trace, all completly eliminated
Not sure why that happens but the voices are telling me
To keep on chop, hack and stab it
And I really can't believe it
I haven't been caught in the action
I just want it all to leave
It gets worse when you're asking
It's my fatal attraction

All the crazy people in this world
All the problems we create
All the prejudice and all the hate

But I refuse so he must be
If you kneel to love it sets you free
Life is bound to be a bore
If there's nothing left worth fighting for

The young await their present fate
Violence show what we can't say I've been around
And I don't like what I found
Staying high above the real
With chemicals, but they conceal you from the core
And you're lost forever more

Remind yourself when you are sad
All you love is all you'll ever have
Keep your brother like it's you
And repell the fake until they're true

Anyone could be your friend
Trust and they will trust you back again
Watch the stars and understand
The Creator's got a masterplan

The young await their present fate
Violence show what we can't say I've been around
And I don't like what I found
Staying high above the real
With chemicals, but they conceal you from the core
And you're lost forever more

Remind yourself when you are sad
All you love is all you'll ever have
Keep your brother like it's you
And repell the fake until they're true



",All the People,2000
Stephen Simmonds,"(Verse 1)
My fate has been sealed, my fate has been shown
It's left me no shield, it's left me alone...
The lonely one's weak, but doesn't lay down
The lonely one speaks when no one's around...
It's cold when you're outside and warm when you're in
I've followed my instincts, so life is my sin...
Love is my witness, love is my truth
Lord is the judge for me and for you...

(Chorus)
Alone...
It's so hard to live
Alone...
I know I can't be positive
Alone...
I got no place to call
My home...
And I got no friends to call, oh, no...

(Verse 2)
The day turns to night, the night turns to day
I can't tell the white or black from the grey

Maybe I shouldn't, maybe I should
Maybe I couldn't and maybe I could...
maybe I should, lady, if you only could>
Lend me some time so I can explain
Show me a sign and release my pain...

If you approve, then it will be
I won't leave you if you won't leave me... leave me...>

Stephen Simmonds,"She was sixteen, just a child it would seem, when the world took her on
Her beauty destroyed and turned men into boys drove their senses beyond,

She was my all, I'm a brick in her wall, another book on her shelf
I'd run when she called, summer, winter or fall, I couldn't help myself

It's been a long time, but she's still on my mind, the way she moves should be a crime

Watch her get down (sweet lord) watch her get down (oh no)
And she don't stop, she rock until your eyes are sore,

Watch her get down (sweet lord) watch her get down (oh no )
Maybe you got the shot, but you ain't ever gonna score

She's got the skills, dirty dreams are fulfilled, when she walks in the room
When will you learn, if you play you'll get burned, like a heatwave in June

Outside in the rain, broken hearts cry her name, until the early morn'
She's heaven on earth, like perfection gave birth, let the word be born

In light of all the evil things, I'm done
I believe there is only one...

From the day that I first saw you smile
There was no way to deny the truth
My love for you has made me see the light
Without you I'm helpless like a child
In a world without its droughts; it's clear,
But now your here forever by my side

Searchin', been lookin', everywhere now I need someone to guide me deep within
Seachin' but after all these years, still undiscovered inside me they won't win

As I await my unborn fate, I trust the insecure
But no matter what I give, they all want more

they all awake, but always late, possessions keep the score,
I look for love, but now my eyes are sore, I wanna feel the love so I go

All the wisdom you possess, where is the love you wear to hide your inside like a dress
You never were sincere,

Stephen Sondheim,"Anyone can whistle, that's what they say-easy.
Anyone can whistle, any old day-easy.
It's all so simple.
Relax, let go, let fly.

So someone tell me, why can't I?
I can dance a tango, I can read Greek-easy.
I can slay a dragon, any old week-easy.

What's hard is simple.
What's natural come hard.
Maybe you could show me how to let go,

Lower my guard,
Learn to be free.
Maybe if you whistle,
Whistle for me",Anyone Can Whistle,1973
Stephen Sondheim,"Could be! Who knows?
There's something due any day;
I will know right away,
Soon as it shows.
It may come cannon-balling down through the sky,
Gleam in its eye,
Bright as a rose!

Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due,
Gonna come true,
Coming to me!

Could it be? Yes it could.
Something's coming, something good,
If I can wait!
Something's coming,
I don't know what it is,
But it is
Gonna be great!

With a click, with a shock,
Phone'll jingle, door'll knock,
Open the latch!
Something's coming, don't know when
But it's soon
Catch the moon,
One-handed catch!

Around the corner,
Or whistling down the river,
Come on, deliver
To me.

Will it be? Yes, it will.
Maybe just by holding still,
It'll be there!

Come on something, come on in,
Don't be shy,
Meet a guy,
Pull up a chair!

The air is humming,
And something great is coming!

Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Maybe tonight\",Something's Coming,2000
Stephen Sondheim,"Deep within the woods, Cinderella had planted a branch
At the grave of her mother
And she visited there so often and wept so much
That her tears watered it until it had become
A magnificent tree

I wish

What it's that you wish child

Do you know what you wish
Are you certain what you wish
Is what you want
If you know what you want
Then make a wish
Ask the tree
And you shall have your wish",Act I: Cinderella at the Grave,2002
Stephen Sondheim,"He's a very smart prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
I was caught unawares

And I thought, well, he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

You think, what do you want?
You think, make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
You think, well, it's a thought

What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who you were when you know
That you're not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if you are
What a prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which you don't?

So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where every thing's wrong?
Or where every thing's right
And you know that you'll never belong?

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's your first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary

And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
You'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose

So you pry up your shoes
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide
You know what your decision is
Which is not to decide

You'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe

In a stew, In the goo
And you've learned something, too
Something you never knew
On the steps of the palace

How can you say to a child who's in flight
Don't slip away and I won't hold so tight?
What can you say that no matter how slight won't be misunderstood?
What do you leave to your child when you're dead
Only what ever you put in its head
Things that your mother and father had said
Which were left to them too
Careful what you say, children will listen
Careful you do it too, children will see and learn, oh

Stephen Sondheim,"No more questions, please
No more tests
Comes the day you say, 'What for?'
Please no more

We disappoint, we disappear, we die, but we don't
They disappoint in turn, I fear
Forgive, though, they won't

No more riddles
No more jests
No more curses you can't undo, left by fathers you never knew
No more quests
No more feelings. Time to shut the door
Just No more

Running away, let's do it
Free from the ties that bind
No more despair, or burdens to bear
Out there in the yonder
Running away, go to it
Where did you have in mind?
Have to take care unless there's a 'where'
You'll only be wandering blind
Just more questions different kind
Where are we to go?
Where are we ever to go?
Running away, we'll do it
Why sit around, resigned?
Trouble is, son, the farther you run
The more you'll be wandering blind
For what you have left undone, and more
What you've left behind
We disappoint, we leave a mess, we die, but we don't

We disappoint in turn, I guess. Forget, though, we won't
Like father, like son
No more giants waging war
Can't we just pursue our lives, with our children and our wives
'Till that happy day arrives, how do you ignore
All the witches, all the curses
All the wolves, all the lies, the false hopes, the good-bye's
The reverses
All the wondering what even worse is still in store
All the children
All the giants

Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter

Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen

Stephen Sondheim,"Did I abuse her or show her disdain
Why does she run from me
If I should lose her how shall I regain 
The heart she has won from me
Agony, beyond power of speech
When the one thing you want
Is the only thing out of your reach

High in her tower she sits by the hour
Maintaining her hair
Blithe and becoming and frequently humming
A light-hearted air
Ah
Agony, far more painful than yours
When you know she would go with you
If there only were doors
Agony, all the torture they teach
What's as intruiging or half so fatiguing
As what's out of reach

Am I not sensitive, clever
Well-mannered, considerate
Passionate, charming
As kind as I'm handsome
And heir to a throne?
You are everything maidens could wish for
Then why no
Do I know?
The girl must be mad
You know nothing of madness
'Til you're climbing her hair
And you see her up there as you're nearing her
And all the while hearing her
Ah
Agony, misery, though it's different for each
Always ten steps behind, always ten steps below
And she's just out of reach
Agony, that can cut like a knife
I must have her to wife

High in a tower like yours was but higher
A beauty asleep
All 'round the tower a thicket of briar
A hundred feet deep
Agony, no frustration more keen
When the one thing you want
Is a thing that you've not even seen

I've found a casket entirely of glass
No, it's unbreakable
Inside, don't ask it, a maiden alas
Just as unwakeable
What unmistakeable
Agony, is the way always hard
She has skin white as snow
Did you learn her name, no
There's a dwarf standing guard
Agony such that princes must weep
Always in thrall 'most to anything almost 
Or something asleep

If it were not for the thicket
A thicket's no trick, is it thick
It's the thickest
The quickest is pick it apart with a stick
Yes but even one prick, it's my thing about blood
Well it's sick
It's no sicker than your thing about dwarfs
Dwarves
Dwarfs
Dwarves are very upsetting
Not forgetting 
The task's unachievable, mountains unscalable
If it's conceivable but unavailable
Ah
Agony, misery, woe not to know what you miss
While they lie there for years
And you cry on their biers
What unbearable bliss
Agony that can cut like a knife
Ah well, back to my wife",Agony,2008

Stephen Sondheim,"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
His skin was pale and his eye was odd
He shaved the faces of gentlemen
Who never thereafter were heard of again
He trod a path that few have trod
Did Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet street

He kept a shop in London Town
Of fancy clients and good renown
And what if none of their souls were saved?
They went to their maker impeccably shaved
By Sweeney
By Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet street

Swing your razor wide, Sweeney
Hold it to the skies
Freely flows the blood of those who moralize

His needs were few, his room was bare
A lavabo and a fancy chair
A mug of suds and a leather strop
An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop
For neatness he deserved a nod
Did Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet street

Inconspicuous, Sweeney was
Quick and quiet and clean, he was
Back of his smile, under his word
Sweeney heard music that nobody heard

Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned
Like a perfect machine, he planned
Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle
Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Sweeney, Sweeney, Sweeney, Sweeney

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
He served a dark and a vengeful god
What happened then, well, that's the play
And he wouldn't want us to give it away

You end me, pal
Second bottle
Ah, she looks for me

Bonnet flapping
Yapping
Ruff
Chicken
Pastry

Yes, she looks for me good
Let her look for me
To tell me why she left me
As I always knew she would

I had thought she understood
They have never understood
And no reason that they should

But if anybody could, finishing the hat
How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when voices that come
Through the window
Go

Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky
And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light

How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see, it's the only way to see

And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""
But the women who won't wait for you knows
That, however you live

There's a part of you always standing by
Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat
Look, I made a hat
Where there never was a hat

And, my dear, I'm still here
Plush velvet sometimes
Sometimes just pretzels and beer, but I'm here

Strummed ukuleles, sung the blues
Seen all my dreams disappear but I'm here.
I've slept in shanties, guest of the W.P.A., but I'm here
Danced in my scanties
Three bucks a night was the pay, but I'm here

I've stood on bread lines with the best
Watched while the headlines did the rest
In the depression was I depressed?
Nowhere near, I met a big financier and I'm here

I've been through Gandhi, Windsor and Wally's affair, and I'm here
Amos 'n' Andy, Mah-jongg and platinum hair, and I'm here
I got through Abie's, Irish Rose, Five Dionne babies, Major Bowes
Had heebie-jeebies for Beebe's, Bathysphere
I got through Shirley Temple, and I'm here

I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover
Gee, that was fun and a half
When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover
Anything else is a laugh

I've been through Reno, I've been through Beverly Hills, and I'm here.
Reefers and vino, rest cures, religion and pills, and I'm here

Then someone's mother, then you're camp
Then you career from career to career
I'm almost through my memoirs, and I'm here

I've gotten through, ""Hey, lady, aren't you whoozis?
Wow, what a looker you were""
Or better yet, ""Sorry, I thought you were whoozis
Whatever happened to her?""

As a gift,

Stephen Sondheim,"Live alone and like it, free as the birds in the trees
High above the briars, live alone and like it doing whatever you please
When your heart desires, free to hang around or fly at any old time

No equivocation, most of all no guarantees
That can be your motto, free of obligation, only the murmuring breeze
As an obligato, live alone and like it, why is that such a crime?

Free to call the tune, free to say if you're gonna work or play
You can have the moon but you don't have to have it night and day

Anyway, on your own with only you to concern yourself
Doesn't mean you're lonely, just that you're free
Live and alone and like it, don't come down from that tree

That's the answer for me
That's the answer for me",Live Alone and Like It,2008
Stephen Sondheim,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
[More! More!]

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
[More! More!]

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
[Except all, all, all]
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all [have it all]
You may find all else above [find all else above]

Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her
What can you lose?

But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her
What if she had to choose?

Did ya come here for a pie, sir?
Do forgive me if my head's a little vague.

What is that?

From the way that people
keep avoiding!
No you don't!

But there's no one comes in even to inhale!
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?
Mind you I can hardly blame them!
These are probably the worst pies in London.
I know why nobody cares to take them!
I should know!
I make them!

Is that just, disgusting?
You have to concede it!
It's nothing but crusting!

Does a business, but I notice something weird.
Lately, all her neighbors cats have disappeared.
Have to hand it to her!

Wouldn't do in my shop!
Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick!
And I'm telling you them pussycats is quick.
No denying times is hard, sir!
Even harder than the worst pies in London.
Only lard and nothing more-
Is that just revolting?
All greasy and gritty?
It looks like it's molting!
And tastes like...we'll pity.

Did I hear you scream?

Runnin' scared, you run everywhere

Didn't want to leave her adopted home

Dark-eyed country girl, tears in her eyes
Needs the music of the wind in the pines

Helicopters fly
Chase him 'round the mountains
Chase him till he dies

They say that it's good sportin'
Shootin' him on the wing
Above the roar and clatter
You can hear your rifle sing

His death song
It won't be long

Sing to the western rancher
The eagle takes his lamb
He's got a thousand others
He don't give a damn

He get up with the sunrise
Everybody gather around
Kill him with the first shot
He'll turn and bring you down

Down down
Crash on the ground

Sing to the noble eagle
Help is on the way

Is a rushin' to your aid

This country isn't safe

Tell her her love is waitin' in the rockie so near
And the mountains is high as his love it is strong
It's a fine place to be by his side she belong

And they both travelled far and they both travelled wide
But they travelled alone with no one to confide
Their love can't grow stronger though now it is deep
They must trust in each other their soul for to keep

And we all know that people ain't made to live lonely
They need to be trusted and loved by one only
That one special one who can just let it be
And remember that Jesus gave love away for free
",Jesus Gave Love Away For Free,1972
Stephen Stills,"What do we do given life we move around
Solitude, reach for light
Rich or slight, we move around

One searches for the sake of searching
Clearly then stumbling, falling, lurching
We move around

A supurb point of reference detected
Becomes absured with a moments reflection
Leaves one a passage of simple thought
Not sagging with the excess weight and excess baggage
And we move around, we move around

One thinks then sinks, then stands at brink
Finds a key and stinks of revelation
Drinking in exaltation we move, we move around

No need to prove no one around
No one but you to stand your ground
We move around
Don't you know it's all right to be wrong
Thus you grow, be amused and be strong

The acceptance of error with grace
Is to refuse to be vain and so afraid of losing face
This fear drives one further into what one thinks
To be a race of life or death
Or simply take another breath of nature's air now
Which is fair now, which is to be alive to move around
",Move Around,1972
Stephen Stills,"The last time I spoke to her
She couldn't talk to me
The script that she read was very strange
But who did she see?
A few lines from a bad dream
A frozen memory

Darkness remains the fate
Of such illusion can't you wait?
I said, ""Now can't you wait?""
On what can be

Who was it mold?
The girl that I once knew
Such a carefully chosen pose
What will the emptiness do?
One of my best friends took her down
With his games for sure

Hearts made of stone
Cannot break again
I hope he understands
I hope he is secure

Old fashioned feelings
A new way of dealing
With love I see
These times were meant for me
No, no, no, no, no

The past isn't anymore
The future only has in store

And where it stops nobody knows

Is a going down

I have no need to roam
I just need a good home

Everybody wants to know

About revolution, mind pollution,
The kind of books I drink
After one last careful look around
I believe that I might like to
Settle down(all right) in a relaxing town

And the revolution crazies

And have Jerry Rubin versus Mayor Daley

Either don't believe it's true,
Or else you don't know what to do
Or maybe I'm singing about you,
Who knows.

It's incredibly sick, you can feel it, as across the land it flows
Prejudice is slick when it's a word game, it festers and grows,
Move along quick, it furthers one to have somewhere to go
You can feel it as it's rumblin'

Let emotions keep a tumblin'
Then as cities start to crumblin'
Mostly empty bellies grumblin'
Here we go

People see somebody different fear is the first reaction shown
Then they think they've got him licked the barbaric hunt begins and they move in slow
A human spirit is devoured the remains left to carrion crow
I was told that life is change

And yet history remains,
Does it always stay the same
Do we shrug it off and say
Only God knows

By and by, somebody usually goes down to the ghetto
Try and help but they don't know why folks treat them cold
And the rich keep getting richer and the rest of us just keep getting old.
You see one must have a mission
In order to be a good Christian
If you don't you will be missing
High Mass or the evening show

And the well fed masters reap the harvests of the polluted seeds they've sown,
Smug and self-righteous they bitch about people they owe,
And you can't prove them wrong, they're so God damn sure they know
I have seen these things with my very own eyes and defended my battered soul,

It must be too tough to die,
American propaganda, South African lies
Will not force me to take up arms, that's my enemies' pride,
Ands I won't fight by his rules that's foolishness besides,

His ignorance is gonna do him in and nobody's gonna cry,
Because his children they are growing up and plainly tired of putting up
With bigots and their silver cups
They're fed up, they might throw up
On you",Word Game,1975

But remember, take care, she'll try to keep you there

The deeper you go
'Cause of the pressure of the air
The nitrogen comes and goes, gets you high
It's an alien atmosphere

They call it rapture of the deep, be you not afraid
You're too far down by now to be scared
Two hundred and eighty-seven feet
I saw Jesus and it made sense that He was there

So belong but don't be long
There's plenty of ocean to share
Please take heed, there's mouths to feed
The ocean, she'll provide
Don't take more than you need
'Cause Heaven just might be the sea",Black Coral,1976

I'll be gone with the dawn, so will you
We choose, who we choose, when we choose

Nobody can take away the time we had
Each moment extra long it's quite a memory to have
Don't you forget with the dawn I'll be gone

Reeling And Snaking And Leaping

I know we can work it work it out
Together
But look hiding behind the walls
Closing doorways to the hall
Nothing ventured nothing gained
What's your game
Just take a look at that blackened tree
It is not for the cause of me
But a stranger was passed there long
And he stepped right in-between us
Picture of empty places
Eyes of reflecting faces
Now your fast emptiness
Now you can see what the fear does
You go hiding behind walls
We can tear away the wall
Change the shutters from the hall
Never voices as that are called
Then you're singing that is all
And the reason for the game
Becomes clearly quite a statement
That's what you get for playing your game",What's the Game,1978

Stephen Stills,"Got out of town on a boat goin' to Southern Islands
Sailing a reach before a followin' sea
She was makin' for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete

Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

Think about
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices callin'
What Heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten

Around the world (I have been around the world)
Lookin' (lookin' for that woman girl)
Who knows she knows (who knows love can endure)
And you know it will

When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a comin' day

So I'm sailing for tomorrow my dreams are a-dyin'
And my love is an anchor tied to you (tied with a silver chain)
I have my ship and all her flags are a-flyin'
She is all that I have left and music is her name

Think about
Think about how many times I have fallen

And we never failed to fail it was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you
And the southern cross",Southern Cross,1982
Stephen Stills,"Much to my dismay
When I wake up in the morning
No one by my side
Nowhere left to hide

I thought, music was enough
I could fill the empty spaces
Wandering the halls
Bouncing off the walls

Too high to hear the song
Or recall the deeper meaning
There is but to seek redress
From this wretched loneliness

With love, that's 50/50
Or a hundred at a time
Love, that's 50/50
With both of us this time

I can hear my love
And she wouldn't try to change me
She knows that I will try to be
The best of me that I can be

And that is change enough
I could lose myself tryin' to please her
And after all was said and done
She might not like what I'd become

So listen to your love
If you let it, it will tell you
You got to try again, again
Find your lover, confidant and

Friend, that's 50/50
Or a hundred at a time
Love, love, love, love
That's 50/50
With both of us this time

Listen to your love
It will sing to you tomorrow
Every day's new melody
Needs a different harmony

So listen to the song
And the part that never changes
The rhythm and the symmetry
Of love's collected poetry

Listen close enough
Hear the whispers of forever
What we have ourselves become
One and one is still one

Love, that's 50/50

Been rollin' by

Have to work so hard""

And her eyes turn green
When she's feeling love
When she's feeling bad they
Turn blue

They're hazel when she works
Until she sees
That my love can change her
Grey eyes, back to green for me

Told me I caught her at her worst
Saw the confusion and the hurt

And my eyes finally meet a lady
Who has something unique
I must know her
Don't stumble on my feet

To this stranger

Fascinated, with this beautiful face
Watching her eyes
There focusin' on me
Pay attention, she is talking to me
I'm the stranger
Tryin' to remember that getting it wrong
Is what everyone does
Mutual attraction can be so
Distracting, forget where you were
Strangers can fall in love
When you think about love at all
And you wind up cryin' the blues
And the lonelies person that you know
Is starin' out of the mirror at you you you
Are the stranger
And you know the danger
It'll be right
And you know that she's
With you

About what she's supposed to do

Might as well just be pretendin'

She told me I should
Follow my heart
Like I'd been told

Isn't it so?
Now many years later
I finally see
How much she did love me
She set me free
Her last few dollars
Put gas in my car
She said ""Promise to write me
Wherever you are""
From out on the highway
I think I wrote twice
I always remembered

Something to make us all happy.
Do anything, take us out of this gloom.
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

You are the one who can make us all laugh.
Doing this, you break down in tears.
Please don't be sad. If it was a straight life you had,
None of us would've known you all the years.

Each time you choose to sing the rock & roll blues,
You take everybody's loneliness with you.
What do you lose each time you face down a room?
All of us see how it changes through you.

So sing of the ocean of tears you have sailed,
Of strangers and lovers that took you.
All of us sang, and all of us failed.
In one way we don't ever hear you.

It might feel good 
It might sound a little somethin' 
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin' 
What is game who got game 
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game 
I got game 
She's got game 
We got game 
They got game 
He got game 
It might feel good 
Or sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin' 

If man is the father the son is the center of the earth 
In the middle of the universe 
Then why is this verse coming six times rehearsed 
I don't freestyle much but write 'em like such (word) 
Amongst times controlled by the screen 
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seeing 
Human beings screaming vocal javelins 
Sign of the local nigga unraveling 
My wonderin' got ass wonderin' 
Where Christ is in all this crisis 
Hating Satan never knew what nice is 
Check the paper while I bet on ices 
Keep more than your eye can see and ears can hear 
Year by year all the sense disappears 
Nonsense preserves prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two triple o is near 

There is something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Tellin' me I got to beware 
It's time to stop children what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Thought of that millennium just be killing them 
It scary like lies buried in a library 
When did state pen correct anything 
When piles of us still be catchin' the bus 
When stacks of cash packed in laundromats 
Pay the preachers back where the teachers at 
I ain't even gotta ask it 
Whose underpaid and got fouled at the basket 
I can't blame the envy at who be getting all the benjis 
And taking them grants for granted 
Last I checked pyramids wasn't built like projects 
On them government checks 
Modern day thugs ain't got no guts 
Pardon the expression under governor nuts 
Last time in a church be the last time in a church 
Dead pledge allegiance to CD's and movies 
Leaving reality believing in fantasy 
Bleeding fatalities too many formalities 
Prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two trip zero is here

Came to town to sing
Took my heart and ran

In the treasure of the oneness

That like sand becomes a diamond

There are no answers

To my questions
Where did they go
And which one took my heart
Which one took my soul

Than you've ever seen me be
I got young though I'm older now

There I stayed for a while

Look at the stars, ponder my fate
Is to fear was it too late for the risking

Now we've had a few years
We're working out our fears
Lots of laughter and tears, and growing

We left room to be ourselves
Got the hand we'd been dealt
And there's nobody else need know it

Stephen Stills,"Cuando sientes que tu amor
Va saliendo de tu vida why nunca regresara
Cuando ella diga ""Adios why buena suerte
No estoy interesada, tu amor no vale nada""

There comes a time when love becomes a trial
And some they will survive and some are sure to fail
No matter what you do it's not enough
For she is as sure as she can be
That she no longer cares to love you

So go on alone, your future is your own
For she has told you now
The time has come to follow different paths

How long will it take you to forget her?
How long for the love to finally die?
How long will her spirit live within you?
Help me, I can no longer cry

So take your life in hand and live it day by day
One moment at a time 'til death comes to collect you
Remember all the love, beyond just simple caring
Obsessively compelling, but ultimately so telling

Why parece que sabeÂ­as que algan dea
Iba a vivir ese momento ya pasado
No mientas ya no llores por tu amor
La vida continea, olvida tu dolor, hermano meÂ­o
Todo todo ha pasado estaba destinado

It took me too much time to realize that it was over
There was no more me and you
Now my life has changed completely
There's an empty place that once belonged to you, yeah

I gave up on you, that's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
Giving up on you, I gave up on you I have nothing left to lose
Even though I know you'll never really face yourself
Or put your trust in someone else that's just the same
As asking all of us to turn away and just give up on you

Every day is different for me now
The air is clear, and the daily worry too, all the time
Easier to repossess, my confidence was weak
I was trapped in loving you

I gave up on you even with the sadness it would surely bring
I gave up on you, I gave up on you even knowing what I do
I was giving up the pain of living without you
My life will never be the same
So I will once again do as you wish, give up on you

I feel so common now my love of decades
Won't you really pass too late?
Hatred's born of demons must be driven from destruction
Now must fight for its own sake

I gave up on you, I'd no more time to waste
I gave up on you, I'd harder things to face
I gave up on you, I've finished with the chase
I gave up on you, while I can still forget the bitter taste
And memories that overcome me seeming to be trying to convince me
That life is nothing but a time to waste, I gave up on you",Spanish Suite,2005

But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine the I’ll ever be happy like before
Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone
Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud
rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones
Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs
We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry
So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stay until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”
And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again
And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle
Perfect and pink in permanent ink
The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses
This heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe,
It’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it",Cannonball,2014

Teach your children well,

The one they picks, the one you'll know by.

So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you.

And you, of tender years,
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by,
And so please help them with your youth,
They seek the truth before they can die.

Was as battered and worn a one as you have ever seen

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world

And I once loved a girl
She was younger than me
Her parents kept her locked up in their life
And she was crying at night
She was wishing she could be free

Course mostly I remember her laughing
Standing there watching us play
For a while there, the music would take her away
And she'd be singing

Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me above the world

And then there was my mother
She was lying in white sheets there and she was waiting to die
She said if you'd just reach underneath this bed
And untie these weights
I could surely fly

She's still smiling but she's tired
She'd like to hear that last bell ring

In the morning, I feel pretty good
So I dropped into the luxury of the Lords
Fighting dragons and crossing swords
With the people against the hordes
Who came to conquer.

Seven o'clock

I taste the warning and I am so amazed
I'm here today, seeing things so clear this way
In the car and on my way
To Stonehenge.

I'm flying in Winchester cathedral
Sunlight pouring through the break of day.
Stumbled through the door and into the chamber,
There's a lady setting flowers on a table covered lace
And a cleaner in the distance finds a cobweb on a face
And a feeling deep inside of me tells me
This can't be the place

I'm flying in Winchester cathedral.
All religion has to have its day
Expressions on the face of the Savior
Made me say
I can't stay.

Open up the gates of the church and let me out of here!
Too many people have lied in the name of Christ
For anyone to heed the call.
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all.

And now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died it was a birthday
And I noticed it was mine.
And my head didn't know just who I was
And I went spinning back in time.
And I am high upon the altar
High upon the altar, high.

If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,

Rooms that face the ocean, moonlight on your bed
Mermaids swift as dolphins paint the air with diamonds

The shadows of your wings fall over my face
I can feel no air, I can find no peace
Brides in black ribbons, witches in white
Fly in through windows, fly out through the night

Why do I think I'm dying sometimes in my dreams
I see myself a child running through the trees
Searching for myself, looking for my life
Looking everywhere crawling on my knees
I cannot see the leaves, I cannot see the light

Then I see you walking just beyond the forest
Walking very quickly, walking by yourself
Your shoes are silver, your coat is made of velvet
Your eyes are shining, your voice is sweet and clear

With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate

To count their bags of gold
And some stayed away as if to say
I know that my way's the only way
Afraid to learn they may be wrong
They preach their nothingness at home

But the wise men came together with the hope to free mankind
Of the rubbish that had gathered in god's name
To embrace and trust each other in the search for the supreme
And they found that all their teachings were the same

Repeat Chorus

Does the night give you power just to rule over me
I've been waiting for the hour 'til your chains set me free
Set me free, set me free, set me free

Full moon shines in your eyes, a bell tolls
Keeps ringin' the hour
The birds you keep, scream to be free
And like a bird I'm under your power

Steppenwolf,"Take what you got to give and let it shine
Take what you got to give but leave me mine
Nobody likes you the way that I could
For you I'd dive to the bottom
Don't you know I surely would

Can you hear me callin' late at night when love comes tumblin' down
Slidin' in your kitchen late at night, hear me stumblin' around
Someday you'll want me the way I wan't you
And then I'll climb through your mountain if you really want me to

Don't hold your knife so close to my head
I'll hide all my shackles and chain on my bed
I know I'm a rounder, it's hard to forget
After all the little playful things I've done

Now if you believe me, then let us be kind
We'll sit down together and talk over wine
If you'll show me your game, then I'll show you mine
'Til our shadows fade beneath the rising sun",Shackles and Chains,1971
Steppenwolf,"Oh, Woman, don't you know me?
Has it been so long that you forgot
I thought of you just yesterday
My time it has been dragging
And I've changed girl but so have you
Please don't turn your face away
It's in your eyes I know
Where did the sparkle go?

Sparkle eyes used to shine ev'ry day
God, I wish I never had seen you looking this way
Can't recall just who was wrong
Guess it doesn't matter now
To dredge the past I have no desire
But it hurts to feel your sadness
And to see the life you've led
Faceless fountains cooled your fire
It was mine not long ago
Where did the sparkle flow?

Sparkle eyes used to smile at the rain
Don't I wish that I could see it again
Where did the sparkle go?

Now if I only knew where to begin
Girl, I'd try to break your fall and stop your spin
But time has changed us both too many ways
And I'm looking at a strange and empty face

And you eyes used to shine every day
If I had only never seen you looking this way
Those faceless fountains they cooled your fire
It was mine not so very long ago

I just can't stand to watch goin' down slow
Where did the sparkle go?",Sparkle Eyes,1971

Thank you girl but I know this town

Don't you know they're all the same,
Only difference is the name
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right

Movie shows and a dozen bars
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Only thing that I can say
We'll be here for just one day

Baby, don't you know
We're leaving early in the mornin'
So long I don't know
We might be back next year
Maybe it just might be never
Don't you worry 'bout it
So long, good to know
Your smilin' face was here

This town is boring you to tears
Nothing in the world ever happens here
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Don't you know you gotta help
Nothing ever happens by itself
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right

Go pack your bag for the open road

Hope he'll tell you what to do

Steppenwolf,"Your eyes are moist, you scream and shout
As though you were a man possessed
From deep inside comes rushing forth
All the anguish you suppressed
Upon your wall hangs your degree
Your parents craved so much for you
And though you're trained to make your mark 
You still don't quite know what to do

It's never to late to start all over again
To love the people you caused the pain
And help them learn your name
Oh, no, not too late
It's never too late to start all over again

Well, it's much too late to start again
To try and find a little bliss
So on your woman and your child
You release your bitterness
You drift apart some more each day
You feel the guilt and loneliness
And the God of your childhood you can't find
To save you from your emptiness

It's never too late to start all over again
To love the people you caused the pain
And help them learn your name
Oh, no, not too late
It's never too late to start all over again

You say you've only got one life to live
And when you're dead you're gone
Your family comes to your grave
And with tears in their eyes
They tell you, you did something wrong
""You left us alone""

Tell me who's to say after all is done
And you're finally gone, you won't be back again
You can find a way to change today
You don't have to wait 'til then

It's never too late to start all over again
To love the people you caused the pain
And help them learn your name

Steppenwolf,"The one who reads the stars has told me
Why you're not like everyone
Your father is a fiery wizard
He travels all around the sun

Orphan girl, you grew up wild
Your father left you on the way home
Yes, girl, you're a Jupiter's child

Wish I knew the way back
Back to where you came
Gladly I would leave here
Take another name
I can tell by you, it must be true

They don't embrace our own disgrace
Somebody, help me off this place

You really quite belonged
Like a pearl among the swine
You tried to live the way we do
Hoping you would learn in time
But, mankind, with all it's virtue
Will soon make you lose your smile
On this earth, with all it's madness
Heaven help a Jupiter's child

Who needs ya'? Think about it baby, who needs you?
Now you can save your lip, just pack your grip
And leave a trail of smoke behind you

Chasing the promise of freedom and hope
Came to this country to build a new vision
Far from the reaches of Kingdom and pope

Like good Christians some would burn the witches
Later some got slaves to gather riches

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands, to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

And once the ties with the crown had been broken
Westward in saddle and wagon it went
And till the railroad linked ocean to ocean
Many the lives which had come to an end

While we bullied, stole and bought a homeland
We began the slaughter of the red man

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

They kicked it just like a dog
And when the war was over
They stuffed it just like a hog

And though the past has its share of injustice
Kind was the spirit in many a way
But its protectors and friends have been sleeping
Now it's a monster and will not obey

The spirit was freedom and justice
And its keepers seemed generous and kind
Its leaders were supposed to serve the country

Steppenwolf,"Some of us are Rock n' Roll stars
Chasing the flash and travel
Most of us wear the right length of hair

And it died with the Woodstock Nation
But what has it left for the carpenter's son
And the new coming generation?
Oh, we all believed we knew the way
But fate did not agree
Now we've tired of asking who we are
And what we ought to be

Here to claim forgotten dreams

Hunting in packs, like jackals
They prey on the meek, the old and the weak
Like a scourge on the face of the earth
All around our town
They're fighting with guns
And building their homemade bazookas
And ten year old Jimmy got arrested in school
They found a tank in his locker
Oh, we all believed we held the key
To peaceful harmony
But the times have changed the way we feel
And we fear our destiny

Sure must be fun to watch a president run
Just ask the man who owns one
Why, up on the hill, they're killing a bill
That would pay for his capitol crime
But cardinal sin- he blessed him and said

But nobody else can do it so well
That's why I'm behind you for three years more""

And throttled your sons in the night
Their foot soldiers pummeled your daughter

There is more to love than makin' it
There is more to you than meets the eye

Is he giving
Is he willing to let you be

For your new true confession
Does he make it, will he fake it
Can he really see

In the back of your memory
Can you say it, do you pray
Has your memory gone

You look so bored with your jet set mother

Standing there at the airport

You sure came alive when your eye caught the headline

And saw the picture of the rebel queen


I know, I know, I know, I know, I know


Everything that went through your head

Time to step in the danger zone

And start a fire of your own



Oh, Caroline, oh, Caroline

Are you ready for the outlaw world?

Oh, Caroline, oh, Caroline

Are you ready for the outlaw world?

Caroline, oh, Caroline

Are you ready for the outlaw

Ready for the outlaw world?



You talk so low in the back street cafe

Makin' plans with your mystery man
You pour out your heart and you tell him your story

Giving yourself just to save the whole world

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know


Every word that passed through your lips
Time to step in the danger zone


And start a fire of your own

Carol is that you?

The evening news an injection

And you can be that too

The night wind howls way up in the canyon
The moon comes out while fog rolls in
One more time I'm waiting for the spirit of the past
To appear and trouble me again

Time goes by like a sail on the ocean
Sleep won't come though my eyes grow dim
And in the dark I see what I have seen a hundred times
The ghost, the ghost of might have been

Oh, it's you
You keep me hanging on
You're the one whose memory I see
Yeah you, you hang on till the dawn
And it's you and what we knew, that's killing me

The love we shared was the dream of a lifetime
The joy we knew, our reason to be
And if it's hard to live without some happiness or love
Worst of all is this hopeless misery

oh, it's youâ?¦

I don't know who to blame
And it really doesn't matter anymore
I'm trying hard to keep the past
From driving me insane
But somehow I keep hoping, to see you at that door

Early morning sun is rising
I can see it rising through the haze
Someone's walking up my stairs, knocking at my door
Lord how I've longed to see that face

Oh, it's youâ?¦..

Steppenwolf,"You see that endless line? They're victims of our time
Who's only crime was to bank on their fathers dreams
To work hard all your life, to raise your family with your wife
And to survive all the heartaches and bad breaks fate may bring
But dreams are seldom real and an aching heart won't heal
Standing in a line for a meal at a strangers door
As night begins to fall, they lay down in the hall of the mission
Of the Salvation Army that is loosing the war
And they dream of home, where someone's waitin'
Waitin' by the phone at the end of their rope
But come early dawn as dreams are fading
They're hanging by a slender thread of hope
Now it's closing time again, she turns her collar to the wind
Goes running in the rain to a friend on the way back home
To hold the only joy the world did not destroy
A laughing little brown eyed boy she calls her own
Though he leads her by the hand and tries to be her little man
He's really still too young to understand her quiet fears
Oh bills weigh on her mind and she hates her daily grind
'Cause time for romance was impossible to find these last few years
Now they're goin' home, where no one's waiting
Weary to the bone, she tries to cope
Sitting there alone, while slowly fading
She rocks to sleep her slender thread of hope
The news comes on at ten, the public servant will explain
How pouring water on the drowning little man will solve the mess
To save our way of life and to help us all survive
Those with nothing will now have to stay alive on even less
And as he spoke these words of wisdom
Like a cruel joke beyond his scope
With just one stroke from his fountain pen
He cut the last and final thread of hope",Slender Thread of Hope,1984
Steppenwolf,"Dry your eyes, come sit close to me
Lay your head on my aching chest
And let me try to console and comfort you

All the time that my work will take
But all is know is , I work for two

And all those times you felt left out
I can't repay but to make these moments count

Steppenwolf,"He was barely a man that morning when he got on that plane
In his pocket some music and pictures of home
A few days later he's lying in the jungle, beneath the pouring rain
Listening to songs of freedom, feeling scared and alone

Can anybody tell me why I'm here, where's the rhyme where's the reason
It's all so crazy, it's madness over here, just who are we fighting for
The guys back home, they're feelin' no pain, yeah, they're living and lovin'
While we are flyin', dancin' and dyin' in this rock 'n roll war.

Everything looked the same that morning, when he came home again
In his baggage some medals and memories of war
But he was different, changed forever and out of touch with time
Walking the streets of home, he felt lost and alone

Can anybody tell me where I am, I feel like a stranger
Some call me hero, some have called me names, some don't call anymore
I made it home, but I'm still in pain, I'm not livin' or lovin'
For I'm still flyin', fightin' and dyin' in that Rock n' Roll war

Tell everybody I feelin' better, it's been slow but I'm healing
Through mother earth and father time, I don't hurt like before
I love a good woman, we have a son, he's our joy, our salvation

Good evening one and all, this is channel 24
Bringing you the latest news around the world
Down in Florida today, someone tried to get away

When he commandeered the train at Disney World
Until noon it was a standoff, but then he lost his luck
When someone shot him down, dressed up like Donald Duck
It was a midget G-man

And we're sorry that we could not show it live
But we'll have film of the shooting here at five
Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll

Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control
From Washington today, called a senator to say
That our future has been cancelled 'cause we're broke

We called the white house without end finally reached the President
Says he don't know if it's real or just a joke
And last night at the playoffs, things got pretty grim
They crucified the referee and tore him limb from limb

Ah, you should have been there
And in the weather, there's a hurricane in sight
And that's the way it is with us tonight
Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while

For the madness has taken it's toll
Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control
Seems like every single day another mind gets blown away 

And the world goes just a little more insane
I got problems of my own, tryin' to keep my house and home
And I sure could stand some cheerful news again
My agent called to tell me my record's on the chart

It's number 90 with an anchor, I never said that it was art
I gotta eat too, ya know
And my buddy who still owes me for his bail
He says, ""don't worry, your check is in the mail""

Steppenwolf,"I was raised in the ruins, mama, 'till I was thirteen
Every day I heard the radio
Every night I had the same old dream
To sing a song, oh, baby, to watch my name in lights

If you want to see your dream come true
Honeychild, you gotta get right down and fight
Well I sailed cross the ocean, girl, I felt so all alone
Many times I thought about goin' right back home

But the Joy I found in song gave me the will to carry on
Live your life the way you want to
Don't let fools lead you astray
Live you dreams so you hold on to

All you need along the way
I was payin' my dues right here in the land of the free
All the time I learned to sing along
I could not speak and I could barely see

Still all the while I knew where I was at
But the people that believed in me
Lord, I could count them all in seconds flat
Well, someday I would be, I knew it all along

And though my dream has come and gone
There's plenty more where those came from

Steppenwolf,"Once the religious, the hunted and weary
Chasing the promise of freedom and hope
Came to this country to build a new vision
Far from the reaches of kingdom and pope
Like good Christians, some would burn the witches
Later some got slaves to gather riches

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands to court the wild
And she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

And once the ties with the crown had been broken
Westward in saddle and wagon it went
And 'til the railroad linked ocean to ocean
Many the lives which had come to an end
While we bullied, stole and bought our a homeland
We began the slaughter of the red man

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands to court the wild
And she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

The blue and grey they stomped it
They kicked it just like a dog
And when the war over 
They stuffed it just like a hog

And though the past has it's share of injustice
Kind was the spirit in many a way
But it's protectors and friends have been sleeping
Now it's a monster and will not obey

(Suicide)
The spirit was freedom and justice
And it's keepers seem generous and kind
It's leaders were supposed to serve the country
But now they won't pay it no mind
'Cause the people grew fat and got lazy
And now their vote is a meaningless joke
They babble about law and order
But it's all just an echo of what they've been told
Yeah, there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into a noose
And it just sits there watchin'

And corruption is stranglin' the land

That I spend on the road to freedom
Don't let it throw you, I know of your strife
I know what it's like to roam
I sang 'em a glad song, played 'em a sad song
Sang 'em the whole night long
Just for a dollar or what they could offer

When the fun was done, I would pack my bags and I was gone

Steppenwolf,"You say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend
Lyin' on the pavement with a misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
He only had a dollar to live on 'til next Monday
But he spent it on some comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?

Someone should call his parents, a sister or a brother
And they'll come to take him back home on a bus
But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
Yeah he'll always be another one of us
He said he wanted Heaven but prayin' was too slow
So he bought a one way ticket on an airline made of snow

I bit her lips and bruised her arms
No I hadn't learned Tenderness

I grabbed her hair and pulled her down
I looked in her eyes and laughed
The love I feel is hard and fast
It's for a face and for one night
I don't need to own anyone 

She said, she said all your women burn in your flame
And as it dies, as it dies, they'll leave you and seek revenge

She laughed and said ""You'll go through hell
You'll live in lonely rooms unknown
And watch for my lost Tenderness""

Five years old and on the run
This ain't no game, boy, don't make a sound 
And watch that man with the gun

Say a prayer for the ones we leave behind, say a prayer for us all
Come take my hand now and hold on tight
Take one last look at that wall

Think of the shattered lives, think of the broken hearts
Think of the battered dreams, of families still torn apart
Wall of bitter tears, wall of crying pain
Wall of chilling fear, you will never keep me here

For I, I shall crawl right down through that wall
I will crawl right on through that wall
That fateful night I was one that got away,
A young and restless renegade

Chasing my dreams, still on the run, 
I had some moments in the sun
Years flew by like a speeding bullet train, I sang my songs to one and all
Then came the day when I had a chance to pay 

My respects to the names on that wall
I saw the wooden crosses, saw the bloody stains
Saw the gruesome pictures of all the ones that died in vain
Wall of countless victims, wall of endless shame

Had just one thing gone wrong I might have joined that list of names
And I cried for all who died there at the wall
I recall weeping at the wall
""Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect,
But we've never had to put a wall up to keep our people in""

While the wall is the most obvious demonstration of the failures of communism, 
We take no pride in itâ?¦for it is an offense against humanity, separating families, 
Dividing husbands and wives, brothers and sisters and 
People who wish to be joined togetherâ?¦

All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin 
And therefore, as a free man I take pride in the words ""Ich bin ein Berliner"". 
(Excerpts from John F. Kennedy speech at the Berlin wall June 26, 1963) 
Turned on the news in November '89

I could not move, I could not speak
Something was burning up in my eyes,
Something wet ran down my cheek

All those laughing faces, all those tears of joy
All those warm embraces of men and women, girls and boys
Sisters and brothers dancing, all singing freedom's song
God, if only I could be there to shake your hands and sing along

Oh I, I would climb right up on that wall

If the heart is a lonely hunter
Then the mind is a loaded gun
Sometimes it begins to wonder
If the love you seek is on the run
All day you've been thinkin' 'bout the coming night
It's the only time you really fear
It holds no tenderness
For you're alone in this wilderness

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

A rough night in the daily jungle
And it's tough times on the nightly news
Somehow you ignore the rumble
Of the heart that's shakin' in your shoes
""Someday"", you just keep on sayin'
""Someday, I will find a way to live my dream""
But there's no guarantee
Still, you got hope and your fantasy

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

Keep on dreaming, keep on scheming
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on hoping, keep on coping
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on believing, keep on achieving
Stay fast and young, your time will come

It used to be when things weren't right
I do my share and join the fight
And would surely stand and speak my mind
Then I got lost along the way
I spent my time chasing my own tail
But I am here to say: I'm back to stay
For I've been searching for the man I used to be
I found him waiting, alive and well
And he was screaming back at me

""Rise and Shine, show your color
Now's the time, raise your hand
Rise and Shine, join your brother
Draw the line, take a stand""

I told my friend my change of heart
He wished me well with my new start
But then he turned away and slowly said:
""You know this world is such a mess
I'm tired of trying to help, I guess""
I said: ""well, what you give is what you'll get
Somewhere inside you, lives the fighter I once knew

And it's keepers seem generous and kind
It's leaders were supposed to serve the country

And now their vote is a meaningless joke
They babble about law and order
But it's all just an echo of what they've been told
Yeah, there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into a noose
And just sits there watchin'

And corruption is stranglin' the land
The police force is watching the people
And the people just can't understand

Steppenwolf,"You say it wsa this morning when you last saw your good friend 
Lying on the pavement with the misery on his brain 
Stoned upon a potion he found upon the wall In some unholy bathroom in some un godly hall
He only had a dollar to live on til next Monday, But he spent it on comfort for his mind- you say you think he's blind.
Someone should call his parents a sister or a brother, And they're bound to take him back home on a bus
But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
And he'll always be another one of us

He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was to slow So he bought a one way ticket, on an airline made of snow
You say you saw your good friend flyin low, dying slow, flying low,dieng slow flying low
He only had a dollar to live on til next Monday But he spent it on comfort for his mind you say you think he's blind
He said he wanted heaven but prayin was to slow

You watch 'em work, these stupid jerks

And we carried him down the hollow
Where we laid his kind soul down to rest
Then we sang until the dawn just to him memory
And found these words to be his last requestâ?¦

When my time draws nigh stay near me
And when I die will you dance to my song
When I'm gone won't you come and cheer me
On my journey back home where I belong

Now how could he know
Just where he would go
And what did he see that made him run so free
And why do I feel, that's he's far away and right beside me still

In the night somebody touched me
And the sea rolled out his name
While I thought of all our times together
His echo keeps callin' back againâ?¦

Steppenwolf,"Words and music by John Kay

I fried in the sun just outside San Bernadino
Flagged me a ride in a rattletrap ford
Rollin' back east to the northern border
I'm back in town to find my favorite folk
But nobody knowsâ?¦and nobody cares
'Cause nobody plays here, nobody stays here
Nobody lives here anymore

I drift by the winos near the greyhound station
Searching for shelter like a castaway
But there are lookers and lechers in a pagan bookstore
That once held a home where I could sing and play
Nothing is left but the faded street signs
To tell me that I knew this place before
'Cause nobody plays here, nobody stays here
Nobody lives here anymore

Everyone warned me not to look for memories
Nothing at all ever remains the same
Now I'm turning around, I'm rollin' back home
Leaving no one behind that will remember my name
But nobody knowsâ?¦and nobody cares
'Cause nobody plays here, nobody stays here
Nobody lives here anymore

This time enough's enough
Don't want a another love to let me down
And though forget
It's over now and yet
You know I did my best to leave it all in the past
But boy I guess I never counted on my heart

It's telling me it's time to move on
You gotta let it go
But something in my mind's still saying no

No sad goodbyes
No one last tries
See I've had enough takin' chances on love
And I said I'd never do it again
One look at you
At once I knew
That no matter whatever
I'll never say never again

If I could have seen. 

And do you ever think of me, 
And how we used to be?

Oh, I know you're somewhere else right now, 
Loving someone else no doubt 
Well I'm one for sorrow 
Ain't it too, too bad? 
Are you breaking someone else's heart?

Well I'm one for sorrow, 
Ain't it too, too bad about us.

I wanted your love, 
But I got uncertainty. 
I tried so hard to understand you,

You know it's true I get electric when I feel everything you do
I know you know it's what I want what I need from you
I'd only be a liar if I said I didn't get a rush
Give me a shot I know you're hot you know I got buzzz

I get buzzz
I get buzzz

I get buzzz off you
Just because I do
I'm saying it just the way it is
'Cause it's everywhere in this room

I get a buzzz all night
And you're making me crazy inside
The secrets out and there ain't no doubt
I wanna give this buzzz right back to you

I get buzzz off you

Steps Ahead,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry, when I'm squeezin' the rye
Takin' all I can get, no regrets
When I, openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me honey, that money
Can you believe, I ain't no saint
No complaints

Hand it out

My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
with scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
with Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
that, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
and on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
and say we want no more of this
and put it in a cyrogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology

Olly olly oxen free, get off of me

get you nowhere fast, I tend to my task cause

your situation, you still have no patience
Flip on niggaz, rob niggaz, even family
All the way up to your moms -- you can't stand to be
in the house, but when you kicked out you beggin
to come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just hoe slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
from the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man
Cause we all African, you want to be a rapper
start practicin, you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life
I won't sweat you for that G you stole

Your head's numb, so your brains a miss this
Pick 'em up, eat 'em up, pick 'em up, beat 'em up
Pick 'em up pimple head, pick 'em up picky

I roll wit globs and I come real sticky
Ripping the mic, I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer. I'm coming out like beers
Like Rheingold, Miller, Coors, and Buds

I'm a eat 'em wit popcorn and treat 'em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack, wicky, wick able wack
Black jack, that's a fact, writing exact behind your back
The funk rhyme to master, blaster

Kicking up in a brainstorm, rainstorm
Rap storm, rap form, rap time, rap rhyme
Rap class, I'm here to fail and to pass
To continue, from the more, hype tip

I roll and rock, rock and roll
Jazz and pop, rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion, pain confusion
Look at the lights, what a night on the town

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

Now I'm back to funk, freak the funk
Hype the funk, swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on 'em, communicate wit the world
Man, woman, a baby boy and a girl

Poppa large looking out the pawn shop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write learn to talk, learn to walk
And watch your step though, I'm hype and ripe though

Kleptomaniac, my rhyme is psycho
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a rag top, an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards

The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull it's card
Jack or Ace, King or Queen, call me the deuce
I'm pouring L.A. juice hitting the top, feeling the rim
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them

On and on, on and on, on and on until the break of dawn
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime, switching off to Prime time
Specifically, strolling back in the west time

Rock the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope, hype the frame, the mic is smoking
Yo, I ain't joking
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp

Rhyme to ill, rhyme to romp
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll
Rhyme to destroy anything toy boy
On the microphone

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

You're dripping sweaty, coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand

Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is loud, you can pay as the manager
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom, taking life more serious

I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight, no grams to kill more
A son of Sam, how could I begin more
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows

You're in living hell, the funk, pound to pound
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing
I'm coming out in sighting
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula

Spectacular and not irregular in fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose

That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one
Look at the master, my range is higher
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

Stereo MC's,"[Verse One:] 
 When I was five years old I realized there was a road 
 At the end I will win lots of pots of gold 
 Never took a break never made a mistake 
 Took time to create 'cause there's money to make 
 To be a billionaire takes hard work for years 
 Some nights I sheded tears while I sent up prayers 
 Been through hard times even worked part time 
 In a seafood store sweepin floors for dimes 
 I was sort of a porter takin the next man's order 
 Breakin my back for ?a shack for headquarters? 
 All my manpower for four bucks an hour 
 Took the time, I wrote rhymes in the shower 
 Shoes are scoffed 'cause the road gets rough 
 But I'ma rock it til my pockets ain't stuffed enough 
 All the freaks wouldn't speak 'cause my checks was weak 
 They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek 
 A way to get a play, and maybe one day 
 I'll be performin up a storm for a decent pay 
 No matter how it seems I always kept the dream 
 All the girlies scream and suckas get creamed 
 Dreamed about it for five years straight 
 Finally I got a break and cut my first plate 
 The road ain't yellow and there ain't no witches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
[Verse Two:] 
 I used to stand on the block sellin cooked up rock 
 Money bustin out my sock 'cause I really would clock 
 They were for kind of fiends bringin jackets and jeans 
 Magazines, anything, just to hustle for beans 
 The cash was comin fast, money grew like grass 
 People hungry for the blast that don't even last 
 Didn't want to be involved but the money will getcha 
 Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture 
 But I still supplied, some people I knew died 
 Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide 
 Money, jewelry, livin like a star 
 And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car 
 In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino 
 For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino 
 I shot up stores and I kicked down doors 
 Collecting scars from little neighborhood wars 
 Many legs I broke, many necks I choked 
 And if provoked I let the pistol smoke 
 Loyal members in a crew now down with the game 
 Sellin nickels and dimes, sunshine or rain 
 What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad 
 In the first time in my life loanin money to dad 
 Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
 [Verse Three:] 
 A thug a-mugs? for drugs, he eventually bugs 
 Lookin for crack on carpets and rugs 
 The squealers tells? but the dealer still sells 
 Little spoiled kids inheritin oil wells 
 I was the type on the opposite side 
 Of smokin the pipe, in a beef I got hype 
 'cause rags to riches switches men to witches 
 Become stitches, body bags in ditches 
 Bloodshed, I painted the town red 
 People fled as I put a dread's head to bed 
 That mean's dead, in other words deceased 
 Face got erased, bullets got released 
 Bombs were planted, the kids were kidnapped 
 In fact that was a way to get back 
 At enemies who tried to clock G's 
 on my block, now they forever knock Z's 
 Plans of rampages went for ages 
 Some got knocked and locked inside cages 
 Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts 
 In God We Trust, now rots to rust 
 Plus caps to cops, policeman drops 
 You blew off his top when the pistol went pop 
 Troopers, soldiers, rollin like boulders 
 Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder 
 Some young male put in jail 
 His lawyer so good his bail is on sale 
 Lookin at the hourglass, how long can this power last? 
 Longer than my song but he already fell 
 He likes to eat hardy, party 
 Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati 
 Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello 
 Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello 
 One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate 
 But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes 
 And than a-wait and wait and wait 
 Til he breaks, that's all it takes 
 So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand 
 On his own two feet because now he's in a new land 
 Rules are different and so is life 
 When you think with a shank, talk with a knife 
 Not my lifestyle so I made a you-turn 
 More money I earn, more money to burn 
 Pushin all buttons, pullin all switches 
 My name is G. Rap, I'm on the road to the riches",Road To The Riches,2000

Get Drunk!

One should always be drunk. 
That's all that matters: that's our one imperative need. 
So as not to feel 
Time's horrible burden that breaks your shoulders and bows you down, 
You must get drunk without ceasing. 
But what with? With wine, with poetry, 
Or with virtue, as you choose. But get drunk. 
And if, at some time, on the steps of a palace, 
In the green grass of a ditch, 
In the bleak solitude of your room, 
You are waking up when drunkenness has already abated, ask the wind, the wave, 
A star, the clock, all that which flees, 
All that which groans, all that which rolls, all that which sings, 
All that which speaks, ask them what time it island the wind, the wave, 
The star, the bird, the clock will reply
""It is time to get drunk

Get drunk, get drunk, and never pause for restWith wine,

Stereolab,"I cannot believe what I do not understand
(It's just impossible to believe what I don't understand)
Understanding and belief should be connected
(understanding is the prime condition to faith)
Thouse who don't get it yet believe are hypocrites
(those who do not understand yet say they believe are hypocrites,
anything which is beyond the limits of human reason is illusion, illusion, illusion)

You have done me no service no you have not helped me
(all you did was confuse but not enlighten my mind)
Therefore I owe you not gratitude but hatred
(nature is vice as much as it is virtue, maybe everything derives from one first cause Or:a trillion times as much as it might mean to you, ...
in which there is neither reason nor wisdom, nor wisdom)

It is amusing to see to what extravagant length
(man has taken fanaticism and imbecility to)
Excesses so unspeakable, unbearable
(the catalog of aberrations is invariably fascinating to contemplate, all we need from morality is contained in those words; make others happy as you yourself would be, and serve them in the way that you would yourself be served, the sole requirement is a good heart, a good heart, a good heart)",Sadistic [#],1995
Stereolab,"Midway between happiness and sadness boiling but not overflowing,
fails to only make a better come back, more powerful and poignant and falls again
Destructive lust for life erected, on the verge pricked up like a picket
fearing to respond to the tempting but malevolent call of the other side.",Tempter,1995
Stereolab,"Tels deux amants de longue date
Une apris-midi
Ferions, nous ferions longuement l'amour
Ce souvenir vivra dans mes cellules,
Quand tes yeux penetrants rencontreront les miens.
Ton corps, ne quitterait jamais le mien,
Unis, resterait une ternit,
Ta peau, ta peau, une fois dans ma vie
Le son profond de ta voix, tel un rayon vibrant
Ouvrira mon coeur.",Tone Burst (Country) [#],1995

Stereolab,"But silence-trera means nothing, or it's just for the rhyme. Cybele's Reverie

Childhood is very nice
Childhood brings magic

What to do when one has done everything?
Read everything, drunk everything, eaten everything?
Given everthing in truth and in detail,
When one has cried on all the rooftops,
Wept and laughed in the towns and in the country?

Childhood is the most real
The garden of new visions

The house, the house, of other times
The house, the house that we have left

And the silence
That penetrates me",Cybele's Reverie,1996
Stereolab,"Les gens viennent
Ils se déplacent

We communicate,

The light it creates and the tears it generates 
Bring the forgiveness 
Don't let me down now

Since you passed away,
To moisten the love 

We have forged the sought after union brought us together and the fullness,
The completeness, the infinite simplicity the world offers forgiveness",Monstre Sacre,1996

This world would give you anything
As long as you will want to

I hate your state of hopelessness
And that vain articulateness
Your loser type wreck want to be
Not a pretty sight really

Of fashionable cynicism
The poison they want you to drink

Wake up and smell the rain shake up he's 
Back to stay he hasn't been on a holiday 
His growing seeds don't believe why he's 
Been away in the school yard change room 
Playing fields bathroom phone box office 
Blocks corner turned around they keep 
Doubting the flame tossing the blame got 
His name knocked up above the sports 
Ground gates but now they're 
Ripping them down stamping the ground 
Picture gathers dust in the bar in the 
Lounge it takes one tree to make 

A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees
A thousand trees",A Thousand Trees,1997
Stereophonics,"We all face the same way 
Still it takes all day, I take a look to my left
Pick out the worst and the best 
She paints her lip greasy and thick 
Another mirror stare and she's going where? 

Another office affair, to kill an unborn scare? 
You talk dirty to a priest, it makes them human at least 
But as you're running away, to start a brand new day? 
Or she going home, why's she driving alone?  

Is anyone going anywhere? 
Everyone's gotta be somewhere  
    
She got a body in the boot, or just bags full of food? 
Those are models legs, bBut are they women's are they men's? 
She shouts down the phone, missed a payment on the loan 
She gotta be above the rest keeping up with the best

Is anyone going anywhere? 
Everyone's gotta be somewhere 

Wait tables for a crook? Wrote a hard back book?
You teach kids how to read? Sell your body on the street? 
A nurse without a job? Another uptown snob 
But have I got you wrong? One look and you were gone 

Is anyone going anywhere?
Is anyone going anywhere?
Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's got to be, somewhere",Traffic,1997
Stereophonics,"I get camping eyes in the final hour
Last minute shoppers picking cauliflower
The fuss they make, you'd swear they were buying a car
They always moan, moan it's not so cheap
Cheaper still, cheaper still down the street
Lose my rag and tell them take your bag and shop down there
Closing down, they're closing down another road
One way, system steals the show
Mac the knife swigs a can and sings the day away

There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest

The flower man sits down in the street
Surrounded by, the stock he bought last week
Bring back the ladies wearing lipstick on their teeth
Make up, we make up a crappy joke
Sit back, relax and have a smoke
Mac the knife swigs a can and sings the day away

There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest

I get camping eyes in the final hour
Last minute shoppers picking cauliflower
Mac the knife swigs a can and sings the day away

There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest
There's more life, more life, more life in a tramp's vest",More Life in a Tramps Vest [Grass Roots Demo],1997
Stereophonics,"It sickens me to see
Photograph in front of me, carnation-colored pink
Stand aside and take a drink
Night club, another scene, 31st, it's Halloween
Slave to each new trend, uptown junkies, push again

The lovers and the wannabes
(They don't know how)
The radio's and TV's
(They don't know how)

Newspaper story reads
(They don't know how)
Cheap girl magazine
(They don't know how)

Stand aside and cry, never wonder why
Ask themselves why, the river has dried

Laughter after after three, shaped up to be free
Number one the most missed chart
Must have broke a thousand hearts
Parallel with the scene, tarnished star evergreen
Live life disguised

The lovers and the wannabes
(They don't know how)
The radio and TV
(They don't know how)

Stand around and cry, never wonder why
Ask themselves why, the river has dried",Chris Chambers,1997
Stereophonics,"She slept on an iron bed
Lived through the war for what?
Butterflies 'round the fire smile
Smile until' she's robbed of all she's got

I heard the innocent got shot today
Grandma died on poppy day
I heard the dress down get turned away
All died, died on poppy day

Fancy dress in a dress down town
Happy Halloween
Door breaks open lost man walks in
Killin' the happy scene

I heard the innocent got shot today
Grandma died on poppy day
I heard the dress down get turned away
All died, died on poppy day

Stereophonics,"Going down la na na
Going down la na na na na

I used to buy my sweets and candy treats at
Raymond's shop
I used to pass there everyday
The time has come to buy a gun and hold up
Raymond's shop
Looks like I will be goin' away

Goin' down la na na
Goin' down la na na na na

It's been two years my minds not clear
I stop at Raymond's shop
It's boarded up he's gone away
The words got out and there's no doubt it came from
Raymond's shop
Looks like our little boys will play

Play away, Ray
Play away, Ray

It's turned about it's back on you
Your famous 15 times by 2
You ask around to find the truth
And all the fingers point at you

You're sick and low, my minds made up
I'm two years down I'm back in luck
I wouldn't save you if you drown
I hope you like you're time gone down",Raymond's Shop,1997

I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
I'm gonna sleep down by his quarters 
I'd like to have sex with his daughters 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
Yeah its big enough for me 

I'm just another great truck driver 
He's just another white house skiver 
Get a gun ready your aircraft 
Big man got ready to broadcast 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
Yeah its big enough for me 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on a war zone 
Yeah its big enough for me 

I'm gonna have to shoot my way out 
To give the access boys some more clout 
I was Butch Cassidy's tutor 
Although sun dance was cuter 

I'm gonna buy myself a small plane 
I'm gonna crash it on the south line 
Yeah its big enough for me
