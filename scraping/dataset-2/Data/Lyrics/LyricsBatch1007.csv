Yo los, take us to a commercial
While we stop to get high
Y'all check out the young guns, ya heard me?

Check this out..
If you have four ounces and you fronted your boy two
And he gave a half to his boy
And the police raided the spot then he flushed one and a half
And he ask you for one mo'
What should you do if you was in that position?

[young guns]
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill

Tell them bitch niggaz - they can keep from around
This is family now, I give a fuck about you clowns
Young guns holdin it down, quick to bust a few rounds
? ? our sound, tell my niggaz and my bitches
They'll drop in the storm, tell them boys it's on
And these niggaz gettin they ass torn, fuck bein warned
This is a street ? ? , I promise to die violent
Now I start wildin, until you bitch niggaz are silent

Nigga fuck that! I'm bout to send these niggaz life back
They talkin shit about my fam and I don't like that
You know how I react, so why you wanna beef?
It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggaz gon' get numb
Here come ? ? down the block nigga don't try to run
I ain't lettin it slide I caught him slippin and him twice
Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

These niggaz fail the test so neverthless I split yo' chest
Fuck the rest!
I come through to spit, to show you niggaz what I manifest
A y.g., so I breathe toke three, ? ?
Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggaz in our town
You get them hot thangs laid in your mouth
My niggaz seek you out no doubt
All about my salary you niggaz ain't gon' handle me
I'm tired of stressin, and all these niggaz pretend they got me vexed

[young guns]
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real

Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die

Yeah heh heh
Y'all ain't think I was gonna make somethin' for y'all
Funky hoes this year, this is for y'all pussy poppin', shake that ass
Goin' to the club, borrowin' skirt, goose neck
Once a month draws changin', funky ass hoes
Yeah y'all funky bitches heh
All y'all bitches tryin' get me for my money
Y'all gonna end up with nothin' but dick and pounds of milk bitch
Ha ha yeah, I done hooked back up with my little cousin mo be dick
Y'all might know him as pullin' rank
But we 'bout to do this shit
We layin' the beats down real thick
And I'm about to get nasty stupid with you funky hoes

[master p]
I'm jumpin' on you bitches cause you hoes got me mad
And all you money hungry hoes y'all can kiss my ass
Tryin' play a playa for his wallet like a bitch
I told you all you mother fuckin' bitches suck dick
Cause all hoes suck dick

[mia x]
You ain't talkin to me

[master p]
Yeah I'm talkin to you bitch
But your pussy fuckin' stank
And stop washin' your draws in the motherfuckin fish tank
You need to get a life, go find a job bitch
Stop suckin' the nigga dick just to get your nails fixed
How many licks in a mother fuckin' lollypop
She'll call you maxwell
Bitch will suck me till the last drop
Don't blame it on the drank and the weed bitch
You and harry are gettin' on your fuckin' knees trick
From your sister momma auntie daughter g
I know your ass back in the mail for me
Now your hustlin' bustin' your ass for shit
Cause ain't no nigga in the hood gettin' your hair fixed
You're just an old perpetratin' dick suckin' bitch
And I'm a let you hoes know who you fuckin' with
That m-a-s-t-e-are to the p bitch
Fuckin' with us killas
I'm a drop you to your knees trick
Think your ass played me like a mother fuckin' dog hoe
I'm a leave your ass dropped dead on the floor ha ha

Chorus:

Fuck them hoes
Fuck you funky hoes
Fuck them hoes
Fuck you funky hoes
Fuck them hoes
Fuck you funky hoes
Fuck them hoes
Fuck you funky hoes
Cause a bitch will tell you anything to kick it black

[silkk the shocker]
Once a hoe, always a hoe
How you gonna tell a nigga you don't suck dick no more
Shit, you bitches know y'all hoes can serve that
Talkin' bout I don't do that type of shit
How many times a nigga heard that
Yeah I'm a pay you some money but ya gotta wait until the mornin hoe
But I'll be like sideways before you start yawnin' though
I don't love these bitches, I never did, never will though
We gonna put it down me and p on you clown hoes
Doggin' bitches from the south to the west coast
Havin' hoes stuck like some dope-fiend without a dope
Don't ask silkk for shit
Cause I ain't got nuttin' but dick and some bubblegum
Fresh out of gum she gonna want some dick
Come over here and get you some

Chorus:

Fuck them hoes
Fuck you funky hoes

Cause a bitch will tell you anything to kick it black

[mia x]
I've had just about enough from you immature shit talkers
Claim you pimpin' hoes and reppin' on your dicks
But really bustin' nuts like water, balloons in your hands
I gives a damn about you cum catchers
And I betcha thought that it was just another dog a bitch rhyme
But mia keeps it on her mind and I don't mind tryin'
A whole heap of niggas runnin' off at the pussy eaters
Sisters don't give a fuck about you and we damn sure don't need ya
Frontin' ass always tryin' clown
But be the main mother fucker havin' dinner downtown
Mounds of niggas talkin' 'bout who got a funky cat
But that's because the fact is that their nose be in the crack
Yeah reppin' on your dick bitch you needs to be smacked
Cause doin' that ride is like sittin' on a tic tac
Black mother fuckers always quick to trip
But know they came up on welfare and shit
Food stamps, medicade and commodities
Section 8 in projects so how you knockin' me
And claimin' you don't trip bitch you know you breaks me off
Before you give your boys or your messy ass moan
At salon shoppin' mall and nail shop here I go
Once my pussy hairs leave your teeth lookin' like a piano
So, I don't give a fuck about them niggas
Talkin' that shit cause you know you gonna pay a bitch
So playa you can talk what you want to yo niggas
But when it all boils down you know your
Bitch ass gonna pay a bitch
I said I don't give a fuck about you niggas
Talkin' that shit cause you know you gonna pay a bitch

Woke up one morning, hang over from last night
I was drunk as fuck plus I was throwin up, 
an my eyes was like hella tite
Waked up out my bedroom, nigga still reachin for a sack
I hads to make me some mail, so I stepped out the door
An fo' i did I went back an grabbed my... strap
I be whippin some shit, nigga gimme some shit
nigga triplin some shit, nigga flippin some shit 
You got some yayo, give it here
I triple that shit for only fifty percent
See bitch I be like Seven-Eleven, like the liquor store
Stop the car, dropped it out, nigga what y'all hittin fo'
Nigga, wassup, yeah I might man, keep it tight man
It be like Charles Barkley
I be hittin three four, all day in the dice game
Man, it's cool, but umm, some of these niggas be faulty
Game be salty, want to run up on me, I'ma have to toss him
See y'all be trippin but I don't be slippin
Pop a clip in when I'm blastin an best believe I don't be missin
It's that nigga - wassup, playa, niggas get fucked
Playa haters get bucked, so wussup? 
Bitch it be A, be	, see, D, E
Yo the last letter be me, a straight G
I keep busters on they back, keep 'em flat that
Nigga, wassup, one-times'll try to check ya, I'm at that
Woke up this mornin, something didn't feel right
Look to my side 'cause I felt some thighs
Musta been the girl I met at the club last night
I had to look twice, damn nigga, I was just like what?
Seen some drawers on the floor, and a condom on my dick
and I knew last night I musta fucked",1 Morning,1996

Another day, another show
Another state, another hoe
My fault, my homie, your girlfriend is walking
Man, uh, she should of been at stage up at my show
Man, yo' girl's a hoe, man
You need to get with the program
On a slow jam I be like knockin boots
But, um, raise up the skirt an I be kockin who?
Maybe it's your girlfriend, I can't really tell they all look the same
It be hoes comin in different, shapes, an sizes, what's her name? 
I don't know, but um, maybe it's Brenda
It could of been Rochel, my homie told me that he hit her
Now a hoe comes a dime-a-dozen
It could be yo' baby mama, or it could be yo' baby mama's cousin
But it's just like I'm tryin to stay Tru
'cause a hoe is hoe an it might be yo' boo (True!)
Hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe, hoe

Chorus

[Silkk the Shocker]
Once a hoe, always a hoe
All of a sudden she's a virgin, hell no
Fa sho I comes to town, on Greyhound, never that
First class all the way so I'm lookin for something to tap
Yo' girl friend is the closest I see, man it ain't coincidence
But um, I gots to like represent, put it down for my dead presidents
I be a hustler for life, I got yo' baby mama at the crib
I don't know wassup but I gots to give 
What she wants she wants it from the back
She gon' hollar my name, not yo' name (Oh Silkk!)
It's all the same as yo' game
I plays her for whatever though (What about my ride?)
Never though (Please?), never hoe
See the relationships I'm in I only deal wit like one
I likes to fucks an get up an plus they mad keep it much tighter
I mess their hair up, he gets they hair fixed
I drive the wheels, he pays the bills
'cause all hoes suck dick (You ain't talkin to me), yeah
I'm talkin to you, bitch
'cause all girls ain't bitches but all bitches is hoes grown
I don't know you 'cause you got cha clothes on

Seen them niggaz rollin in they cutlass
I'm about act bad, no doubt, I'm a go in they house
And if they home, I'm a blast, take them niggaz out
Cause we be bout drama, no fuck that, we bout killin
Drama, fuck all that, stay real when it's time to peel
Caps, no doubt, hah I check the house
Cause I ain't gon be satisfied till all ya'll stressed out
That's a fuckin shame, I ain't gon be satisfied til I see blood, nigga
What you think we was doin before we was rappin, we was drug dealers
You think I'm a let this shit slide cause I done got fame
Fuck the name, I can't have shit in this fuckin game
Without niggaz tryin to test nuts, tryin to act bad
I'm a fuck you nigga
you gon have a closed casket and I'm gon crack yo mask
You talkin shit, but, bitch, it's goin down
See I was locked up for a second, but now I'm home now
It's time for niggaz to get checked, they done pushed me to the limit
I was a cool nigga, but now, it's only the beginnin
It's time to ride, when it's time to slide, you die
No doubt about it, act bad, let's put that on the vibes

[Master P]
Mr. Wicked, I be comin hard, just like a hurricane
Choo-choo, shootin brains, killin Mr. Murder, mad
Hustla, balla, Mr. fuckin Do-a-reporter
Don't give a fuck about a bitch or a balla
Break me off proper, gun in that doctor
Gats at yo head, call me Mr. Non-stopper
Tech 9 shooter, lady, ruder
Down South hustla, West Coast ruler
3rd Ward villain, I'm in the killin
They ban my videos from TV, they say they drug dealin
Ice cream slangin, 
And if the radio don't play this gangsta shit, what are they thinkin?
They could stop, a nigga from comin up
They could stop a young nigga from makin big bucks
Independent, and black owned
But still got more money than Al Capone
y'all niggaz can't stop a killa,
A murder, a hustla, fuck it, a drug deala
But if they shoot, did up with police
Ready to run dope from here to the Middle East
And call me Mr. Paul
Cause I be smokin muthafuckas like Steven Seagal
Mr. Killa, the ghetto Kadofy
And 187 on any nigga that try to stop me

Chorus (2X)

[Big Ed]
Niggaz, they want to start some stack
but if they stack then let it be started
And at your funeral, I want to here em say dearly departed
Because I got it on my mind and on my mind I got's it
When I pop ya with this heart rock
make your heart stop cause I'm bout it
Jack you like a New Jersey drive
My niggaz are always down for that who ride, I ride
Creep with these killas on our tippy tippy toes
See the barrel knows where the bullet go
and then we smash off in that 4 by 4
See we rolled on ya set and then bucked
A bunch of niggaz fallen and they can't get up
You wants to fuck with this TRU click and get ya khakis creased
Get your shirt pressed and the bullets rip through yo chest
TRU niggaz don't fall, fool, we to busy flossin
It might be your ho we tossin
Step to us and we make ya hits like Michael Jackson
Cause every nigga in my crew is bout it and we packin

Now back up in the days I run game on em
They wanna play games so I bought a Lexus from my homie
An the next day after that, game don't stop

See how many number I can jot down, how many girl I can knock down
An plus up on my block, now it ain't gon' stop
Now, since I got a little cash
Now I dash down the block but I keep my game tight
When I'm in the Rover, I gets the guests the same night
You try skeezin me, should be try pleasin me
Alizay to get the draws off easily

Now it's none of their business, how I make my ends
An you can't get a piece of my funky dividends
I guess you could say, I got it goin on
'cause I keep seein girlies an they won't leave me alone

[Silkk the Shocker]
I guess the PD is tryin to see me in the State Pen
Behind me tryin to run my license plate in
I'm checkin my rear view, but I ain't gon' trip, bruh
Waitin for me to slip up, show me some ID wit yo' picture
I guess they wanna see my bank statement
See how much money that I'm makin
But I guess they just be hatin
They need to start missin me, stop trippin G
I guess they mad 'cause I got more gold than Mr T

An all these freaks wanna get in my gangsta ride
'cause I got it front to back, an side to side

Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot

Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there cause I clocked smoke when I was finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood

1st Verse: [Master P -- Fiend] 

Master P: 

Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, 

but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin' 

captain? 

All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, 

I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. 

I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, 

No Limit niggas don't say hoes, 

ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... 

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change, 

but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains. 

Chorus: 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Mr. Captain Kirk, I want to have yo baby. 

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze), 

all you ghetto hoes get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig, 

bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in 

approximately five minutes. 

Chorus 

Verse Three: [Mystikal] 

Aww HOLD UP!!!, WAIT A MINUTE!!! 

my mama done got me bent. 

What the fuck you mean, where I was?, who I was with?, 

and where the fuck I went? 

Bitch you be beside yoself, you probably WOULD, 

if I left ya', but I ain't gon put you on no pedestal, jus 'cause

You smokin' my weed ridin' my ride, 

I'M TRYIN' TO KEEP IT REAL. 

I can't seem to satisfy you, 

bitch she trippin' bout' the BILLS!!! 

her rent ain't paid, but she got her hair done, 

this bitch gotta be stopped!!!, Hope man done got it made 

and ride my pockets to the top. But oh no, you 

bitch, you ain't responsible, for what a nigga man 

do give a fuck bout' what a nigga bout' to do,

Get the fuck out my face, ya' fear too, stop runnin' 

behind my G dues, can't wait to see that nigga that got 

trampled like that 'cause that ass whoopin' been due. 

It's thinkin' like that, that make it hard, 

for me and the rest of my niggas. 

Mean these tramps they it like weed, 

SHE GETTIN' THE BEST'A YOU NIGGA!!!

don't forget to pick up some pampers and milk. 

Also a jar of pickles, and Ice Cream. 

I think I'm pregnant, smile Kirk, your finally 

gonna be a father, oh yeah, and don't forget to

Silkk the Shocker,"And the lady America was finally slaughtered 
And divided into 3 quarters 
Her children the cities fell
Battlin' golden' platinum 
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed 
Pity was not spared for no man  woman  child or rapper 
And believe 
For his rap was felt by everyone 
And this time when trust had no meaning 
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decide to the world 
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival 
To open up a path to reality 
For some, judgement 

[Verse] 
The devil took the straps off my nigga legs 
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed 
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies 
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese 
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold 
On these streets, anything goes 
He was on the road 
It took 'em ten to do him in 
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again 
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks 
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks 
The reaper came and took him 
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him 
As I walk through the shadows of death 
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath 
The kingdom of freedom is all they said 
Why the shackle and chain? 
My homie's life slaid
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride 
Bite the apple of eternity(uggggHH) 
Every mother will cry 

[Chorus x2] 
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends 
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end 
 
[Verse]
Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending 
Start to finish 
Losin' or winnin' 
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin 
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine 
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die? 
Now my whole life I was scared 
The only judge is god 
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws 
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill 
But I lost too many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal 
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps 
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death 
And even though I never see 
I believe there's a god 
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy 
When times is hard 

[Chorus x2] 

[Verse] 
As the sand slowly poured 
I see flashes of life 
Time started ticking it's the end of my life 
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god 
Behold no man or your life destroyed 
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom 
Big ones and small ones 
Good ones and mean ones 
As the angel came the ghetto from hell 
Some words of the piece cause they didn't know no better 
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire 
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire 
Crosses burned cause they souls was scarred 
Hoping for a second chance but ain't none 
Cause it's your final call

All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though you're gone away
I know you're in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday

I used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin', got me perkin', never jerkin'
Still blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'
Your little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes
Spendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang""
I ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

Even though you gone away

You gon' live through me and other TRU playas)

Even though their gone away
I know you in a better place

I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had
Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin' I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos
Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon' miss you

I know you in a better place

So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her

Nigga play me like you was scared to lose

Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more
I'm just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas want to blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
don't want to see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started?
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really ain't hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool don't mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors

but I'm going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
y'all young crazed punks are trippin 
don't hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ??
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ??
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for?  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I can't fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know y'all gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get something 
don't worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say that's not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they won't touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just can't call it or catch

In my pockets I'm knockin', the feds can't stop me
Most hoes they jock me, I got knots in my pockets
Caviar and bitches, 6-4 and switches
Champagne and riches, but cooking keys in kitchens
Mansions with marble floors, knocking off chocolate hoes
Boots with ignition, Ferraris and drop rolls
I live with killers, dealers and TRU niggaz
No Limit guerrillas, mercenary killers

Army fatigues, niggaz straight like g's
Livin' like soldiers with g's, soldiers at ease
Slangin' fuckin' tapes like keys, swang 'em just like keys

Got them smokin' on our weed, but not for free

Ya'll live for bitches and blunts

The black Frank Nitty see,
Oz's to make g's
The mayor gave me and P keys to the city
Livin' an American dream
5 karats on my pinky ring
Ladies wanna make love to me
Niggaz wanna look at me all mean
But it's aaight cause you still wonder
I don't want your old lady
But she still flip me the number, I wish she'd flip me some money
See um, it's aight to have cash and thangs

But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks

That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac
They said p where ya going man get in
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10

See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted
And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains

Silkk the Shocker,"[Intro Master P]
What's up niggas and bitches.
It's the motherfuckin' kisarme.
It's No Limit, Master P.

I'm a introduce y'all to the motherfuckin', 
One of the hardest lieutenants on the tank, Mystikal.
We was all born to be soldiers.
See, these evil thoughts,
They was scarred into our motherfuckin' souls from these wars,
The streets, the ghetto, the hood. The ghetto.

[Chorus: x7]
[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!
[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Mystikal]
Ah, ATTEN!
Hoo! Muthafuckas don't you move
I got what is takes to make your ass feel (?)
You don't want to rest in this parade
No Limit soldiers throwin grenades!
Strictly, heavy artillery, calm and gunnin
I got your ground troops runnin from INCOMING!
Go, go go go, the future caliber
Bout to rip your (?) vest, split your capita
The niggas be marchin in the land camp
Bitch we ghetto soldiers, the streets is what made us!
No LVE's, no MRE's
But we kill our enemies, and drive humvees!

[Chorus: x5]

[Master P]
Born, to be, a muthafuckin soldier
The colonel don't play, I'm out that tank
Money in the bank, make niggas thank
At ease when we rank, salute cause we cap
Fools run they trap, soldiers bust caps
Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once
Put that on my gold keys, my gat, and my blunt
Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's
We bout it, eyes on our CREAM cause we rowdy
Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages
Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character
I'm ready to bust keys, niggas (?)
Niggas are fuckin, slanging them trees
They gon die in New Orleans

[Chorus: x4]

[Silkk]
I came out the motherfuckin womb, niggas want to combat tank
My ghetto antics, my ghetto tactics
I smack quick, stick another gat nigga to your ass and acrobatic
Nigga what? Black, my M-16, is black bitch
I was born to drop phat shit
Punk your ass like a sac bitch
Yeah, I keep a gat bitch (?) I react quick
Blow them soldiers, told ya, and that's it
But see, I set my shit off like a punt (Go, T, Go)
We roll, I said we roll like a muthafuckin blunt
See, don't come stunt and don't try to front
I'm Silkk the Shocker, I snatch your ass like a muthafuckin duck
I put on my camoflauge nigga, straight up my fuckin boot
Why would a muthafucka who ain't TRU laugh at old shoot
About face, salute!
Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I talk
Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I march (Right, left, left)
I was born to be a soldier!

[Chorus: x4]

[Fiend]
Bringin bags and weed
Lil Fiend live by the soldiers creed
Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues
War fatigues, playing live chess games with the chain
(?) at the gun range, cause I'll bring pain
When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest
But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest
I was best on my recon, started harm and dis
The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this
Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide
Cause the crime design, stay from nine to five
Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up
No Limit soldiers, the world blow up!

[Chorus: x3]

[Mac]
Assassin, soldier, sniper, murderer
Son of a bitch, arsonist, house burglarer
Been there, done most before the sun rose
We changin clothes, when the po po's chase
Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face
And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways
And even when I'm dead and gone
My legacy'll live on
Tatoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on
Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit
For lunatics who be feelin this shit
Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real
Pops gave me the game, bout to bag a feel
We attack like the Men in Black
You react, if you got a gat
I'll never die, camoflauge in my vein
I'll never change in the purple rain
My name manifest pain, I'm a soldier

Silkk the Shocker,"It's crazy out here (uhhhhhhh)
Yo mama I'm tryin to keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)

Uhhhhhh!  (uhhhhhh) I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto trying to have a little change
My homies killing up each other cause we gotta eat
And I ain't tripping cause I'm running from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starving
I done seen more hoes messing then Marvin
See in the ghetto the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
Until I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media starting east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they predijuce on us all
Come out of the powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
when you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there living like that
That's why the rest of you niggas aint never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
how many niggas in the cemetary don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto got to lose thier lives?
WHY!!!!  Why you gotta make your momma cry?
HUH!!!!  She take you out of the street
cause that's where you gonna die
But you won't listen cause your mind is one track
and your head is hard
And your getting flipped, and your talking back
Showing your ashy act, ass straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall
but that's far and all
And sore and all, it's cool when it started off
Now niggas duckin bullets like dodgeballs
Niggas got me scared to plant my seeds, fear of high's gonna grow
Living in a messed up time, a messed up court
I'm telling ya, you can't do shit no more!
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
that's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
Cause it's your world, and we your children
your sons and your daughters
We struggling, trying to get out of the ghetto
trying to make it to mars!!!

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Dear mama pray for your son, hoping I can make it through this game
Wishing I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
The only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinking hennessey but I
But I can't get too high, cause I gotta keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penetentary close, but you know what?  Cemetaries aint that far away
Before I die I'm trying to make the whole world feel
like our people scared to stand there
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
But look into the eyes of a ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from the sirens of the police
See now my life aint been the same nigga, life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died, before he die little cousin told me this
Get you something cause cemetaries
packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children it was hard 
To tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I like to scream when I came home from jail
When I was told best friend turned into a fiend
I aint gonna lie, my conscience aint clear, when I close my eyes
Of course you gotta realize, god forgive me, I'm just trying to survive
They cut welfare and health care, that shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie having a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

On how to cook dope, and chop a key

It seems that I got riches
When I got money, I got bitches
I got friends that want to get it
Can he hit it, then quit it
To try to survive and stay alive
It's a everyday struggle,every day hustle
You can see it in my eye, but I don't want to die

And I then lost the closes thing to me
Pretty fucked up trading,
or i got some killas that want to do me
Them girls trying to blue me
What all I trying do, is what I love
Let my people know I feel them,(?)
And then go smoke some bud
I got a habit with drugs
Which I ain't suggesting for beginners
In my hood, ain't no winners,
just some thugging ass sinners
Presenta, my life, my life, and take a good view
My bad days, i wouldn't dare
want to wish them upon you.

Now see I didn't ask to come here
I guest untwisted faith of luck
15 minutes of unprotected sex,
in a heat of moment, came a quick ass nut
Now if I wouldn't been born
I wouldn't grew, I wouldn't knew
Never had to go through, half the tangs a nigga went through
I'm in the projects hearing gunshots
Right before I close my eyes
All I heard was one shot
And they only sent one cop when he died
I got some questions
That I couldn't really understand for awhile
They say rain brang pain
But what brang smiles
And see I guess I was to caught up in those fake niggas
And bitches to know
I guess I was blind by the fast money,
and switches on the 64
They gotta, gotta be a better way out,
then hell or jail
I know I'm wrong for selling dope to my family
Just to get mail
Some get high off of sess
To relieve their stress
But no matter, how much success
You can't cheat death
Where yal at

We can't stop now bitch!!!

So bitch don't try.
We tru soldiers, we don't die,
We don't die, we don't die. 
We don't die, we don't die.

I'm bout my paper, my paper,
Important people on my pager.
I might not drink Alize,
But I'll smoke you under the table.
Don't make me peel your potato,
Don't make the devil your neighbor.
I might not be nothing to you,
But I'm the shit on this label!
Five hundred words might make it hard to digest what I say,
But five up in the morning, see me on the billboards
Y'all gonna keep it that way.
Hold on as tight as you can,
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip,
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before, we not gonna fall, put a banana in the tailpipe,
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six, wearing no muthafuckin' jail stripes.
Been bout it from the start nigga, we raw nigga,
You don't want to, go to, war nigga.
We superstar niggas,
You know who we are niggas.
From poverty in the projects,
To livin' large niggas.
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got,
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

[Chorus]

Nigga want to start shit,
That they know they can't finish.
By far niggas want to go to war,
But they know when they ain't winning.
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line,
Been bout it, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme.
No limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign,
Y'all want to play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time.
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black,
Y'all want to go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, 'cause I drop, by no means, look,
Bitches dyin' like a dope fiend, while he have on a pair of old jeans.
Nigga what?  pistols we all got, sometimes it's all glocks,
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked.
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot,
Nigga please, I got all the g's for breakin' these ki's down to all rocks.
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together 'cause y'all not,
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus 'cause y'all stop then it's our props.
If you want to get it started, then let's started, but let's do it right,
But if you want to get started, get started, let's do it tonight!!!

Have the whole world wonderin' what Silkk The Shocker, Master P did.
See it ain't no limit, it's only the beginnin'.
Why? 'Cuz all y'all want us to fall, and hit the wall.
It'll only take a minute, an' see I gets the bomb tree.
Beats by the Pound shit, it sound sick, rolex, and baguettes all.
I take this out the ghetto an' live up on top.
Akin flights, an shoppin' sprees, on 5-0-4 yachts.
See, money don't change me, make me live a lil' bit good.
Took some of my family members, an' my homies out the hood.
See, we ghetto millionaires, far away when we meet.
I think they watched us, P, 'cuz about when we speak.
See I'm too deep to change, everybody know my name.
I guess I gotta charge it to da game.

Ugh! Green money, I like to count, honey.
My only bad habit that I like to sell B's, honey.
We hot, check the Billboard spot.
Twenty-four g's an' P's to make a club rock.
Now they violent, gotta get it rowdy.
Peep game gotta Benz, Lex Luger in or out it.
Don't hate me, the money don't make me.
It's gonna take two hundred million just to break me,
'Cuz I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya.
I like that doja, but hate the rollers.
Crystal, greed, an hinace, got cream. 
Makes a brother in a Bentley, from the ghetto.

You done lately, your girl wanna date me, in my grill.
For, Ugh, an' I'm straight g.

[Chorus]

I guess they call me a hustler, 'cuz of the fast livin'.
But if I see somethin' I gotta get it, because I have vision.
An' if I like it, I gotta get, if I saw it.
Went from, over the shows, over the doors,
House full of floors that's marble, a brand new Ferrari.
Parked it, when I bought it, see, I'm a no limit soldier.
An' I came to get it started, what you, what you think?
I'm all about my bank, tryin' to be a multi-millionaire.
Before I'm old enough to drink, now we can ride, bro.  No lie, bro.
See, nobody be here beside us, so go ahead an fire it up.
Some girls wanna perk it, my homies like to work it.
Soldiers from Texas, all the way to Jersey.
Tick to the tock, all around the clock.
From the north, to the south, 
To the east, to the west, it just don't stop.
So to all my real g's, throw them up high,
To all the ballers that have the corks of Crystal, let it fly.
That's how we live.

9 times out of 10 
them jackers sit here

pussy stunk
I ain't tripping on the stupid
Id rather have a good time in this bitch
trying to get my smoke on 
what you got cigarettes
(ah that's it the bitch got to be stopped hold)
I still got a guard left over from last night
Damn I like to forgot
I don't blow  no joes
But inhale some weed smoke
Id rather be hitting you from the back 
if you really don't know
she said my periods down
Ita be gone in a minute
then she said
I thought you had some weed
then tha bitch said 
let me hit it

chorus x17",Let Me Hit It,1998
Silkk the Shocker,"[Chorus: x3]
Mama always told me (told me) 
But papa never showed me (showed me)
So I live the life of a thug 
And all I want to do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs 

Mama always told me it'd happen
But she never told me when
She said probably happen when I get much older
But I kinda wish it would of happened then
'cause I had my mind on gettin' some money
Nigga I'm tryin' get rich
Mom told me never trust these niggas
And ummm never put your faith in the bitch
See I hang with a bunch of grave yard villians
Nigga robbin' sprees we stealin'
Choppin' keys with drug dealers
Click like pistol with killers
They tried to preech to me, couldn't preech to me
Tried to teach me, couldn't teach me
See I've gotta learn the hard way on my own
'cause nobody else could give me a reason 
They always told me I'll probably end up dead
Or in the pen see me and P some outcasts 
Can't arrest the family tellin' the kids not to be like him
And see it was ruff some times but it had to be
Enough trippin' on Cess go hand your back and pass the weed
I ran wild deep in the game off of change
Nigga bitch won't fuck 'em nigga won't kill me 
But its all in the game
See pop was too busy doin' his own thing to try to show me
But mom told me Silkk watch your paper 
At the top it gets lonely, mama told me

[Chorus: x2]

Mama always told me (told me) 
But papa never showed me (showed me)
So I live the life of a thug 
And all I want to do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs

Token guns on my side, no limit niggas gone ride
Paper chasin' for millions Tru niggas won't die

Make time for some dope nigga fuck bein' broke
I live my life on the ropes nigga fuck the P.O.

I leave you dead with the bustas 
Real niggas gone love us
We make crack with the killers and sell dope to the country

Nigga nigga outlaws and dealers tattoo and killers
Niggas bout it with millions now the world gone feel this

I'm staying TRU to the game you bitches callin' my name
Mama told me to change its ghetto blood in my vein 

See I got love for thugs never mix sex with drugs
My enemy in blood when I come bury me a thug
Henessy and weed be a ball with desert 
These shirts and kakis is how we work 
Hypnotized by change after fortune and fame
I roll 20's and thangs rolex and change but uh..

[Chorus: x2]

Mama always told me (told me) 
But papa never showed me (showed me)
So I live the life of a thug 
And all I want to do is smoke weed, ride, and sell drugs

Right from the edge killer nigga gone off coke
Brown sticky dope makin' niggas turn on their folks
Ain't now rules, fools rush in but don't come out 
So many niggas round my way die runnin' their mouth
Fairy tales are for children we ain't story book livin'
South streets be bloody from all the shootin' and killin'
Villians ride for similac and crack and smack 
And its a fact all killers ain't inner city blacks
My homies have to serve on blocks that's hot with cops
With rocks and stacks and be packed to get their scraps
I don't knock it 'cause if my pocket starts to lose weight
You can find me on I-10 tryin' move weight
My mama on her knees prayin' givin' god her time
While I'm on the streets hustlin' tryin' gettin' what's mine
Am I wrong am I right got can only determine 
I can only live my life and life is for learnin' check it

Silkk the Shocker,"Uh
Me and you together had plans on making the day, having cash
As time passed tryin' to make it all last
You know we struggle
Hope we can see better days
And the time different dreamers is to go our separate ways

See you was always good
I was always bad
You was always in school
I was always to cuttin' class
Cheatin' on my tests knowin' I wouldn't pass
Told me slow down nigga I was movin' too fast
They always told me ?
I wish you well one day
If you could be spent up, shot at, get me out of jail some day
Yeah, I was told to be like you
And at times I tried
Realized the only way I can beat these streets
The only way I knew to survive
I remember comin' home high and drunk
Smellin' just like a alcoholic
Tryin' to sneak you in
They damn near caught us
We be down to rock the block party's all night
Even thought we clown, we be down to fight, all night
Hangin' with the big homies
Askin' what they hittin' fo'
I remember stealin' junk food out the neighborhood liquor sto'
Sittin' back remeniscin' on all the things we had
Even thought it was rough, it never seemed so bad
Our destiny, we can't shape
I know we made mistakes
Even thought i wonder why He took you
I can't question fate
I guess it was written 

But check it out
You still hear 'cause you gon' live through me, see, and Silkk

Me and you I always thought we'd be together
I shoulda' known nuttin' last forever
And see I, destiny, we can't shape it
Even thought I wonder why we die 
I can't question fate
Me and you I always thought we'd be together
I shoulda' known nuttin' last forever
And somehow I always thought you'd be there
Get a deg on the mark, it's cold, but it's fair

See man, right now I just gotta watch my step
No matter how many homies I lose
I can't get used to death
I remember us 5, runnin' wild
Just tryin' to get paid
It wouldn't seem like a jail
Put some rose on Dante's grave
(No reason you gon' die)
Gimme for thinkin' that
You were my brother 
I'd pay millions to know I was safe
A million to bring ya back
y'all my family, as well as my friends
And if I had to bring ya back that mean I havta lose ya again
Your memory's gonna live on even though ya' gon'
I'm sittin hear contemplating where it all went wrong
We had an argument, I said some things I shouldn'ta said
Never got a chance to apologize when you didn't come home that day
I'm thinkin' about memories every time I lay down
I wish I woulda known
I woulda apologized
But i guess I gotta say it now
So I see you when I get there
But for now I'ma pour out liquor

I ain't calling every woman a ho, but, uh, if the shoe fits, wear it,
'Cause, uh.

[Chorus x 3]
Tell me what you think, after you talk to one of these stupid hos,
Tell me how you feel, after you fuck one of these stupid hos.

Uh!
Do you feel the same?  Some hos want your change.
Hos been chasing niggas, rolling on their thangs.
They look for dope dealers, ballers, and hustlers.
See, real bitches hate busters.
Some bitches'll let you fuck 'em till they bleed.
Uh, but rats like cheese.
You see, pussy stretch 'em out.
You go raw, and hos make childs,
And then the game, it ain't no thing.
But it's a shame cause a ho in it for one thing.
They after big timers with big papers, Biz Markie make vapors.
But see these hos will hate you if they know that they can't break you.
Some of these hos need to shut their fucking mouth.
Wishing for a new car and don't have a house.

[Chorus]

Don't play no games, trick, keep my name up out your mouth.
You say you hate me, but at the show you damn near passed out.
Wanting me to pay your rent, but not your relatives.
You mad at me, your baby daddy don't claim your kids.
You want a baller to fall for you.
But after a nigga fuck you, he don't even call you.
Dollar signs in your eyes, ho.
Claiming you a virgin, but on tape you fuckin' big Mo.
You rippin' round town, you say you fucked a tru nigga.
I ask P and Silkk, they say they couldn't remember.
You or your name, you stupid ho.
So get your kids, get your drawers, and hit the door.
Ho, I ain't got time for these bitches,
Stupid biatch.

[Chorus]

Now would I see if I fucked these hos, man 'cause P calls them a trip.
Lookin' at me like a big old dollar sign, figure them hos can get rich.
Now everybody worrying and shit, looking all stupid and shit.
Niggas be acting soft.
When I met her, she was cool as fuck.
All of a sudden, everybody got a fucking problem.
Now, why you worrying about what kind of car that I got?
Conversating with those tricks, you talking shit.
Been looking at my rings and my watch.
Now after you hit it, look this trick, who you giving the cold shoulder,
And after you get your nut, then you be like mad as fuck.
Look at her be like man, it's more over.
So you be sad when she there, and you be glad when she left.
And you be mad when she around so you pack your bags and stuff.
These hos like a diamond, 
And be wearing things for free, but I'm a put them in they place.
Man, them hos be cool at first,
Then turn fucking crazy like a guest on Ricky Lake.
I'll play the game for what it's worth nigga, lil' G done keeping composure.
I'm a soldier, when I go on a date, I'm a bring guns, fuck bring roses.
These hos a trip.

[Chorus]

Ha ha, yeah.
What these hos don't realize;
They don't realize that uh, 
If we was to give a bitch something, even if it was a few G's,
It really ain't nothing.
It ain't nothing but pocket change to us, nigga.
Can't break the bank, baby.
And uh, treat these hos like fiends,
Give them just enough, so they'll come back.

You were so, ha, scared to react
But now when there's drama, you talk about step back
And pass me the strap
It's so much pain, in this game
When I close my eyes

Check this out

Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm  tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being 
Shot

Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor

Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

Never knew how to treat life
Knew once I get my shit right, it was gonna be right
I see life, and I'm livin' up to my dreams
It was a hard struggle
But that was only just for a nigga to bubble
Some of my people made it, and some of my people didn't
But I'm gonna ball for why'all, big baby
And ball actin' crazy
And watch my back, for the shady nigga tryin' to do me somethin'
I'm ballin' cause my rhyme done threw me something
Hard labor, and hard times
After hard rhymes
Glad I ain't got the glock no more
Takin' what's yours and call it mine
I called my moms' today,
She asked me did I pray?
I told her, I got to, cause the streets I'm roamin' on is one way

See the street life be shady
I wonder, if my parents knew before they made me?
That shit's crazy
Will I survive this shit?
Maybe
But see, I've been strugglin' and hustlin'
Ever since my, grandmother was a baby
You think I'd be sayin' to myself
How many more days you leave jail?
When I can be on the street with my peep nigga
Countin' some mill
Hypnotized by fast thangs, fast cars and fast bitches
I'm tryin' to have fast things, can you dig it?
(What's up?)
Hopin' outta 4 doors
(What you mean?)
Sittin' low in low-low's
Never fuck with, no I don't know hoes
For sho' hoes
Come from the South and no doubt I wear jibo's and polo's
Everything I ride is chrome and mo-mo's
can't' trust a few, cause that's a no no
You gotta watch your back, cause niggaz will jack
That's why I stay strapped with 4-4's
See, I'm tryin' to have enough money to turn every project into a condo
Every nigga I don't like, to wino's
and every girl that alright, to fine hoes
And my next contract
Negotiate for 89 O's
Now see, the street life be hard, but I still drop the top
And niggaz be lookin' at me all mad, so I cock the glock

Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me 
They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels icy 
Tryin' to settle down Ma, stop actin' all feisty 
Cause 'I don't want to be a playa no more' 
Know it's soft, but I came with a core 
For the love of Money, Charli, whoa It Ain't My Fault 
Like Silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it 
The whole Squad is Terrorin', cats is No Limit 
And I'm a diplomat, I'm a diplomat 
Where my honies at? Where my money at? 
That's why we act like that 
Clak clak clak, pat pat pat!

Dominican race, like my Twin Triple says 
Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in 
Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick 
Reppin' Uptown to Harlem World, where we at 
I'm up coughin' in the ambulance 
From way downtown, they got the Horses and the Carriages 
For forty bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on 
Another twenty, puff lye and get ya crush on 
It's all love, just like the Bud when ya hit it 
Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it 
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark 
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park 
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug 
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love 

[Chorus]

Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uhh 
I thought I already barked on cats about Russ Hadden 
It ain't work, gotta Scream on cats like Wes Craven 
Oww! They ain't know I had it in me 
Like Lil' Kim, didn't know they had it in me 
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show 
Cam and chrome bag the hos, in Prada bags all the dough 
And caked out, break out, uh 
Horse & Carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats 
And they ain't know, passin' that down 
Where I come from 
Ask Jane, that's my dun-dun 
How we handle them dumb dumb's 
And we like, Siskel and Ebert 
We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right 
And down if they new jack's 
You might see Charli, in a Benz or Ferrari

And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick

(Must be a car), Miss I could pull you, with or without the six 
Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it 
So if I ain't far from C-E-O 
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money 
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much 
Like Mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust 
So many styles 
Drop a beat, I'ma drop a hit 
Rap game stop for the dope game 
And cop a brick 
No Limit Soldier baby, so watch the talk 
Get lost like, Oh It Ain't My Fault! 
I'm from the N-O, L-I, M-I to the T 
Tru my click, Silkk, the Shocker, yeah that's me 
Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it 
Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like 
Ooh I love Silkk, and then, ooh I hate him! 
Cause they can't have me, but I don't look 
I can't afford to live average 
So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage 
Now I don't want to settle down, but we can do it like we married

Silkk the Shocker,"Hey dad I got in a fight with this white kid today at school
Son, didn't I tell you I don't want you fighting?
But he called me a nigger

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Its a shame when you can't send your kids, to decent schools
We live in the world for the laws and no rules
Gang-bangers, crease sides, and chalk lines
Correctional facilities full of juveniles doin' petty crimes
In this ghetto, got me crazy
Sometimes I wish, mama wouldn'ta made me
But its a shame when you gotta raise a baby
And the color of my skin might taint me

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

And all the money can't change the color of your skin
Why so many blacks and Mexicans in the pen?
It is cause we VIOLENT?
But why Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and started smilin'?
So many people have dreams
But why society eliminated Martin Luther King?
And they tell us to be proud to be black
And at the same time Uncle John shoot us in the back
Independence, its a free country
No jobs, most blacks turn to street money
A bunch of ghetto full of drugs and alcohol
Where found history books about white laws
And Tommy Hilfiger discriminate
And sell us clothes
But we can't blame him cause
We don't support the black stores
And only God can judge or point the finger and what's
White or black and red and blue equals gang banging

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

(I'm just a black man
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain
(Hold on, hold on
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain

P pray for your little brother
Silkk, keep your head up

I'm tryin' but sometime I get fed up (Damn)
What about all of the people that died in the past?
Peers I can't get back with too many found guilty
And I know they didn't do it
But still they can't get back
I see the copper be tryin' to nail me
Police constantly trailin' me
Cause I'm young, rich, and black
I'm always under survelience
Dash me out the car
And wanna ask me who the car fuck
Thay allowed to carry guns
Can't never be convicted
Who that law fuck?
I'm guilty till proven innocent
Still we all equals, how do you figure?
Cop told me
""you weren't speeding but I'm gonna give you a ticket cause you a nigger""
I seen the hardest of my homies
Break down in tears
A white judge looked them in the eyes
And gave them 35 years
Now its a everyday struggle
I hustle just to live
To raise your kids
When they got them teachin' them
Their parents better than them
They got me thinkin'
The color of my skin
Is a sin
I'm a black man in a white man's world
Where its set up for me not to win
Lookit, ain't that about a bitch
They look at us like we ain't shit
But lookit, I ain't racist, but face it, it exists
I'm a black man (Ungh)
I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Check this out (check this out)
Underneath (underneath)
Ain't no black or white (there ain't no black or white)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all (remember that)
Got the same opportunity
Whether we wanna be judges, doctors, or lawyers
Ain't a black or white thing
Pick the best man for the job
And there shouldn't be no hatin'
Where you live, if you can afford to buy a house
Should be able to live wherever you want
The same hospitality they give to athletes
And movie stars
Should give that same hospitality and companionship
To your neighbors
You heard me?
Y'all know it ain't a black and white thing with me
I just make music
For the reality
Only the real could feel this, huh
Only the real could feel this",Black and White,1998

I ain't been the same since my auntie gave birth to a crack baby
want to know why I'm rowdy I be clutchin' my glock 
'cause if I have P and see come over and tell mama young Silkk just got shot 
I couldn't even close my eyes and not feel the pain 
I could re-open my eyes and realize 
all the niggas that lost their lives in this game 
I lost a lot tryin' learn the facts of life fuck color nigga we all struggle
with this black or white to all my niggas in penetentaries 
I received ya'll letters 
and I swear to hang in there if things don't get better 
now picture this I got Auntie diein' of overdose uncle diein' of aids
realize that I got a little money but there's somethings money can't save
is there a heaven for gangstas is there a heaven period 
and based on the fact that things did wrong probably 'cause I hang with
too many killers and niggas diein' over wars shits hard where I'm from
that's why I spit it how I live it and I get it how it come 
on top of that I had a fucked up day 
to god look couldn't find the words to explain so I'll tell you
tonight when I pray feel my pain

RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real 

But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed 

And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave 

And I remember when you first got high

And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do 

I never imagined living life without a nigga like you

And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through 

And ah me, see and Silk we got a little money but that don't mean shit

Ended hard trying to move on but still I try 

Even though we got money, judgement day 

just some things we can't buy 

Even though you gone, I never let you move on 

Cause every time i think about you 

I sit back and write your name in a song 

Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt 

It's kinda spooky when one day I see your face on a t-shirt 

I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better 

And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 

Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 

Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them

My adversary's get popped
Got me runnin' from cops
The ghetto life be a dime
Got me carryin' two glocks

My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drive-bys and rags
And representin' red and blue flags

See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos

Pullin' in car do's
And cut up Jabos

[Chorus: x2]

I'm down the blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die
If the hood call me

That's why I be hustin' every day
Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

See I'm a risky rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga

See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been scared, popped at, and shot at

But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I ain't forgot that

[Chorus: x2]

It's real, shit's real check my war wounds
This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons
I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube
Either me or you right here

Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Lay yo' ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
There's no overcome to this shit
Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq
If you don't believe me check my combat pack

[Chorus: x3]

I got a motherfuckin' story to tell
Nigga, nigga what?
A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?)
Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell

And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
I shank niggas, bank niggas
Do mo' for show
Seven cluckas, fake dough

Stayin' way cut throat
I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin' in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall

Seven Eight ward
Eastside, rollin' dubs
Call me big Snoop Dogg
Follow me, and you'll see how Gs move

It's written on my face
I takes my war wounds
Been around drama since me and my mama
Use to listen to oldies

That's why I'm so old G
Look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside
When y'all was learnin' how the sing

[Verse 2: Magic ]


I got to be real with ya, I'm that type of nigga that really don't give a fuck 

My hobbies was totin' tecks Jack and my first words were give it up 

It was hard to maintain, couldn't see myself workin' this 9 to 5 

I'd rather be hustlin' on the corner with my niggas, gettin' high 

Chancin' my own life, I'm strapped, got a pocketful of bud 

But I wouldn't have it no other way, my daddy done raised a thug 

I never rooted for the good guys, I was always for the bad (bad) 

I guess that's why I got Master P's pictures posted around my pad 

My ghetto heroes was drug dealer, killers and cap peelers 

I didn't do too bad for myself 'cause, now Magic makin' millions 

Me and Silkk unbeatable team we can't be stopped (can't be stopped) 

We ain't got nothin' to prove to nobody (nothin') 

Fuck wit' us, you get popped 

It's a brand new generation, and we the children of the future 

So I'm gon' do what I gotta do because that's what I'm used to 

Either you with me or you against me, ball or nigga fall 

But I'm a No Limit Soldier, so I'm comin' for it all

I'm yo soldier (every soldier needs some thug love)

Verse 1 

[Big Ed] 

Had my back ever since I was pulling 211's 

The rich dude, I was on my knees trying to shoot a seven 

Even when there's no food in the fridge, you say you're lucky to have me 

Never tripped on the life I live 

You had my kid, you held my strap to prove it's for life 

You got Lady Assassin tatted on your back, sometimes I don't act like I should 

You still understand what I'm going through, the pressures from the hood 

I'm trying to make it all good forever 

I can't see living life without me and you together 

I know I'm gone a lot trying to make it, but just have patience 

It's all for you, my soul I'll stake it

See you're a star, met you at the bar, seen you through the Cartier frames 

Excuse me miss, I'm Silkk the Shocker, TRU is the clique that I claim 

Money and wealth, good times and bad times, that just comes with the game 

Don't trip on the females and shit, miss, look, that just, like,

I need a down girl that's down to ride 

See that girl, look, 3-5-5 Ferrari parked up on the outside 

I live the life of a thug, that's why I'm never smiling 

Got out the projects with my thugs, I'm probably on some like island 

See, I'm a soldier and I need a soldierette like you 

Hot tubs, backrubs, celebrating over dinner for two 

Said you want to go to war, let's see if you can last for the 2nd round 

And I don't know, there's something about ya, makes Silkk the Shocker 

want to settle down 

Now what, I told ya 



[Chorus] 



Verse 3 

[Master P] 

I hang with killas and gees to get my cash on 

I need a thug girl at night to get my smash on 

Lingerie with the camoflague (camoflague) 

Hennessey with the weed, baby girl I'm at the front line 

And we can do it til we weak (til we weak) 

A little Isley brothers, me and you, between the sheets 

In the game getting rowdy (Ungh!)

Yo, see them out there
Yo fiend, fuckin mafiaso
If your fucking with no limit
Fiend, big ed, master p and silkk
You fucking with the best
You don't want to fuck with the best
Yo mucha

[fiend]
Chorus
I only fuck with a few
You never know what these niggas'll do
You better choose careful who you call your crew
And do a review on these bitches, before you call em your boo x2

You never know what's goin on with
Some of these hungry ass niggas arrested
And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Receiving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion.

Chorus x2

[master p]
I'd rather die hustling then be broke and lonely
Cause most of these niggas out here be phony
Find me on the street corner living my life fast
[big ed]
Remember take a bullet for your homie
[master p]
That's my nigga big ed
[big ed]
See this tru shit nigga I'm a kill for it
When the rents due, ya know I'm a steal for it
Take a ride with my homies if I have to
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause they'll blast you
[master p]
And momma sheds tears cause my homies seen that
Nigga gangbang seen tru up on my chest
To my niggas in jail, stay strong doin time
I thank the lord for taking me out the ghetto with these rhymes
Blood stains on the street cause this ghetto life's a bitch
And that's a shame cause it's bound to change once a niggas rich

Chorus x2

[silkk the shocker]
Come take a ride at, before the game begins
I seen niggas die bad, and they die for pennies
Can't trust nobody seen around my way
Niggas dead, and that's why they ain't around today
See penetentaries, they ain't no place for me
I tell my mom don't trip, just pray for me
And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years don't even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life
That's why I ball till I fall and live the first right
So even though I thug with them, I still ask these niggas
I've seen a lot of cold shit, ? ? ? ? ? been home test if I get ya
I only ride with niggas that I test the water with
Niggas I slang quarters with, slaughter shit, spent the hardest shit
Only trust a few, only trust a few
You fakes, I can't even fuck with you

Chorus x2
",Only a Few,1998
Silkk the Shocker,"(master p chorus)

Feel my pain, feel my pain
This ghetto got me goin through some thangs
God feel my pain. (x4)

(fiend talking)

There comes a time, where uhhh, you have things of yourself, when you
Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got sons of funk,
An me fiend, an my people, master p an silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life.

Verse 1- (fiend)

Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass ""a"" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.

(chorus-sons of funk)

Tell me what we gonna do? the world ain't the same man,
The way we live is a shame, I can't hide this pain. (x2)

(master p chorus x4)

Verse 2-(master p)

Ughhh! lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave,
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid,
These ghetto tears got me out there wantin to scream,
My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend,
I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt,
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell,
In the ghetto's ? ? ? tory, wit fiends an crack cells.

(chorus x2)
(master p chorus x4)

Verse 3-(silkk the shocker)

You might catch me, walkin wit my head down,
In the pourin rain,
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain,
I coulda been born son of a king,
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

(chorus until song ends)
(master p chorus x4)

(fiend talking)

Sittin here tryin to take the pain away, see this one here
This for all my ghetto fiends out there
Fightin these street wars, to all my no limit soldiers
To everybody in the penitentary, I feel yo pain
This ain't nuthin like bein free, tryin to take the pain away
Rest in peace

[Silkk the Shocker] 
I got so many questions I don't know where to start 
[ Wellwhy don't you start from the pain that runs deep in your heart] 
(Is that you? God is that you? ....... It's me) 
Is there a heaven or a hell  if so is that theory true? 
[Yes my son] 
Why go through so much? 
[It's a test my son] 
So I guess it was you when ?? gave me the last second to run 
[Yes] 
And I don't know why I shed so many tears 
Forgive my God, I haven't been to church in months 
[Aww son you haven't been to church in years] 
Some times I rob, steal and kill, just to eat 
I popped him, I don't know if I killed him but somebody died in my building D 
[He's here with me] 
You think you can forgive me for my sins? 
If so hold up, another homie died ?? you think you can forgive me again? 
[I don't know] 
Some times I feel like death is chasing me but just ain't catch me yet 
I'm wondering if he is going to catch me when I stop to catch my breath 
They say days are cut shorter from the things that you did 
And if so then why take the kids? 
[Hold up, hold up my son] 
Huh? 
[It seems like some puzzle to you, if you got something to ask me, ask me] 
Why is it racism? Where did drugs come from? 
Why is it so much death where I live? Who idea was it to make guns? 
[Y'all] 
And why my grandparents was slaves? 
And why is is diseases with no cure like cancer and aids? 
Why is it rich and poor? 
Why is it a death row? [For real] 
[That was y'all I ain't have nothing to do with it that was never my will] 
And though I try and do everything, I just want to know if it is worth it 
[It was] 
Sometime I feel like I'm doing it all, sometime I just don't feel like I 
serve my purpose 
[Keep your head up] 
Nigga scared of the past 
All my homies want to know but scared to ask 
[Tell them to ask] 
God everybody for they self Sometime I don't feel like I'm all alone 
[Feel you] 
Don't worry bout me if I have to go so watch my brother them when I'm gone 
And what about when I couldn't pay my bills I was almost kicked out where I 
lived 
[I just wanted to see if you'll break] 
And everything happened at the same time 
[I just wanted to see how much pain you can take] 
And you must know my lifestyle 
[I do] 
Knowing I can't change my life 
[I don't want you to, do what you gotta do anything not neccassary you'll pay 
the price] 
So why did my homie die instead of me? 
[Because I had bigger plans] 
I don't understand 
[I'll explain, see I wanted you to grow up and be a better man] 
I want to know, how you determine who dies and who stays living? 
[The day I made the world my son, it was written] 
Look I gotta couple mo' questions I need to know 
[What?] 
God, can you tell me, when is it my time to go? 
(everything goes silent)

Silkk the Shocker,"I remember when we were kids
We shed all our hurt and tears (and tears)
No matter what the weather, what the weather
We were always togerther (always together)
We grew up as time went on
We became separated (seperated)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

Kevin life ain't tha even tho we gots tah change
See momma don't understand how you died in tha game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he's a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for tha rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said ""P be strong"" with out you we all alone
I know its been a few years you your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Look, just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean I'm hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
And when you left, part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin shhh ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember tha last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton 'cause on your birthday I go and put flowers on your
Grave
I still remember when P and see broke tha news to me at school about your death
Told me ""Silkk time would heal our wounds""
It's been oh five years and I ain't healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong
I know moms tryin to hold on
Even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, that's why I can't move on
(It's somthing about you)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Now as I could remember (remember)
A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take tha pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson, could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood don't show that man no love
'Cause kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of you're real homies is wit ya
And its sad can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up 'cause when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)

I'll be the freak that taped inside of you
Buy you new ties and shoes
And what you gonna do
Why don't you tell me how you really feel
You got to keep it real
Tell me what's to do

Tell me what's on your mind
Do you like what you see
Are you interested in me
Can you please tell me what's on your mind
Do you like what you see
Are you coming home with me
Can you please tell me what's on your mind

Have you ever seen a woman like you, baby
So sexy and so beautiful, thought off and confused
Girl it's up to you, if you don't or if you do
Girl it really doesn't matter, but I don't have the time girl
Oh to make you mine girl
You know you want me

Tell me what's on your mind
Do you like what you see
Are you interested in me
Can you please tell me what's on your mind
Do you like what you see
Are you coming home with me
Can you please tell me what's on your mind

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

[Chorus]",The Day I Was Made,1999
Silkk the Shocker,"(Silkk)
??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End of the Road,1999

And I'll still respect you tomorrow, and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose
And my time is like dollars so I only got a couple minutes to lose

Boy give us respect, y'all shit on deck)
Aight Snoop, you got the weed (yeah) and I got the liquor (fa sho)

And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin, call us, it's outta control

Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

guess we were both like phony
jumped in too quick
ideally cus we both was lonely
we go 2 stores and you never peek at the price
Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good
matter fact it was all that'
Sometimes i feel like we just didn't match
Found a friend
But only friend till then you alwayz came first
Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

[Silkk The Shocker]
I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

So when I go on, hardcore never go soft
Shit i'ma throw the fuck off,

Djuo want to fuck with me, like that 'cause I'll beet ya ass so bad boy
Won't even think bout fightin back

First I'm looking at, I look at your strange ass bitch",No Limit,1999
Silkk the Shocker,"For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even gon' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood
Now during sex lay there I'm have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type
But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattoos with my name on it
Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with
Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

You keep, keep on askin' me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin' in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won
You know what I'm sayin' it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 
Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin' trips to the east
Takin' shoppin' sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four
Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more, imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

[Chorus]

Every woman need a down man
Every man need a down chick
Watch your so-called friends
Watch them niggas you hang around with
I need somebody I can be serious with
I need somebody I can clown with
It's thug love and I think I found it

[Chorus]

Will I fall
For this thug
Will I fall for a thug like you",Somebody Like Me,1999

I bought your only fuckin house, and your first fuckin truck
You pawn your rolley boy?
Oh...you doin' bad?
Stop trickin' to them hoes, and you wouldn't be on your ass
Now when times got hard
You ran your mouth like a bitch
Sold your soul to the devil, when you ran with other cliques
You ain't no soldier boy
Take that tat off your stomach
Nigga talkin' bout he love me
But bitch you love my money
Now if greed come between me and my niggaz
May god bless his soul
And I hope he forgive me

And I don't fuck around with you niggaz
Stop step the fuck away from around my Bentley
I'm bought to blow off these fake niggaz head
Sayin' ""what's wrong with Slim?""
Them niggaz fake P
That's why there's no fuckin' songs with them
We put our money together
Just like we started with crack
We let a couple niggaz shine
We bought to take it back
You know its mic's now nigga
We started with gats
Let a nigga play me on the streets
So dogg, I ain't gonna start with this rap
Gonna let them fake niggaz go

Like them G.T. bitches, them Saint T. bitches, my No Limit bitches
Them boss bitches who 'bout they riches, and it ain't no secret
They want that soldier dick that you only get from that soldier clique

Got a nigga saying ""Ohhh girl""
Come a little closer, I'm trying to make you out my boo girl
Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that

You know I just got outta jail and everything 
and I'm trying to change my life for the better 
You know I got kids to feed but I got a question you know 
Where do I go from here? 
 
[Chorus ][Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
 
[C-Murder] 
So many rainy days and gun sprays, I'm hearing AK's out my window 
Close my shades, let me blaze on this indo 
My situation getting sticky, life is green 
I mean I'm 19, and my momma is a dope fiend 
And I think about all the hard times we had 
No dad, no time shared, the buster never cared 
A little bastard child, going wild, 
Another victim of a broken home, my TRU friend was the chrome 
And if it wasn't for bad, I had no luck at all 
I represented my hood, I sprayed my name on the wall 
Fresh outta jail, and I'm here to see the sun rise another year 
But tell me where do we go from here 
 
Chorus [Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears?

I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
 
[Mac] 
The ghetto is hot, it's dark, and most of all it's a prison 
Most of my niggas serve life sentences, only the few is risen 
I made it out the hood but my people still there 
Some of them dead, strung out, up in they wheelchair 
I still care from a distance 
and I know that any day could lead me back to that crimey insistence 
I tell the kids be persistent, when they follow they dreams 
Ain't no telling what tomorrow brings 
Ain't no time to be wasting, you want to be a doctor or the patient? 
Hesitation can lead to expiration, only God can predict it, 
Where do we go from here, snorting powder, drinking beer 
Smokin' crack, killin' our peers, I shed tears 
 
Chorus [Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
 
[Silkk] 
Where do we go from here, after we all gone 
and where do we go after we ain't got no place to call home 
Hell I'm just glad to be breathing 
?? like I was the projects for a reason 
Shit, tell my niggas we gotta live, and some gotta give 
why'all gotta rise above this shit, and turn negatives into positive 
Yeah I struggled, but I'ma hustler, and that's self explanatory 
So if I die trying, the hood can just tell why'all my story 
Niggas seen killings and drug dealings, 
imagine we'd dream through it all 
Old ladies ?? through the window, I guess she done seen it all 
It's up to you, cause nobody seems to jam with us 
We struggled to long at the bottom, nowhere else to go but up 
 
[Chorus] [Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears?

Hop on the plane sperm or nothing never thawed out
Have her saying my name like destiny's child

Speaking more sex than money so talk with your tongue out
And sex unbelievable, plus the money never run out
I'm a thug so I walk the street with my gun out
Top up when the sun set, top down when the sun out
Oh you want me, pushing up your number on the slick
Try to make the scene when I was in front of the click
How bout I pull the thongs off in the summer and shit
Laughing at my joke when it wasn't even funny and shit

Dear God, I know I'm wrong sometimes but
Who are they to judge me
Cause umm...he who don't sin should cast the first stone

[Chorus]
Dear God, Forgive me for my sins
Cause all I wanted to do in this world was to win
To all my soldiers in the grave or the pen
All my soldiers, that's blowing with the wind, life is hard
Dear God, Forgive me for my sins
Cause all I wanted to do in this world was to win
To all my soldiers in the grave or the pen
All my soldiers, that's blowing with the wind, life is hard

I ain't got time to worry about who hate me or love me
Why would I care how a nigga feel when only god can judge me
I know I deserve 5 mics for how hard I strive
But I'm cool cause I really only need one mic like Nas
and I ain't got time to worry about whether my foes is mad
Got bigger problems, should the color of my cars or clothes be black
If you really want to understand me, then just come with me
Then you really understand why I keep the gun with me
Only way to make money, if you slung rocks
Rap was the hot shit, you had to have a jumpshot
Look, I try but my shots was off
I stay fly, stay driving something new on the block, y'all
It don't take a rocket scientist if you can add
I never had a job figuring out you do the math
Tell my nigga I had a fight with, I never told you I was starving
What's the rush, I figure I could just tell you tomorrow
But tomorrow never came, well it came but you wasn't around
I know God took you but I know you still looking down
You know I do this for the ones that ain't got no choice
I speak the truth for the ones who ain't got a voice, let's go

He ain't real, He ain't gangsta, He just really talk good
And that get chu put up on a stretcher
For pullin it out, trying to mob like you was Claudia Shepard
See my motto is ""I won't pull it out unless I use it""
So if you heard I pulled it out, no doubt you heard I used it

Just Do It
You ain't gotta talk all loud in my ear
Just Do It
Yapping and stuff when I'm standing right here
Just Do It
You ain't gotta tell me what you gonna do
Just Do It
I'ma do me so you do you
Just Do It
You ain't gotta tell me how you getting no cream
Just Do It
Nigga yapping, trying to sell me a drink
Just Do It
You ain't gotta try to front for no broads
Just Do It
Trying to mug, trying to be all hard

What's up killa, you hear this then don't think, bounce
You counting me out, motherfucker, you can't count
Windows cracked, Car drop low, I'm laid back lord
In a Chevelle, 100 ??, no sixes on the course
Ain't no stressing in my blood, game on my back
Knock you out just for sayin my name on wax
Cause if its that serious, e-mail me, send me a fax
If it's that real, watch how quick I get back
See, I been about my stacks way before I been rapping
Playboy, what's on your mind, look, lets get it cracking
I been having paper way before I went platinum
It don't take too much to get it jumping, man what's happening

[Chorus]

Niggaz be handcuffing their girl when I'm around and shit
I don't know if its me or the nigga don't want me around his chick
I was looking besides she was looking first
She ain't even my type besides look it just wouldn't work
I'm the type to tap why'all and wild out with witnesses
I come back, different day, different clothes, and different whip
I'm paid and you broke, I already know how you feel
You ain't gotta ask about flow, you already know I got skill
But better calm your boy down, have him walk it off
Cause in a few, he ain't gonna be able to walk at all
Either we all can get along
The dude and crew or we can all be alone
Or we all get the chrome
Whatever it is, just please stop callin my phone

[Chorus]

Hustler, Baller, Gangsta, Caterpillar
Yeah, Who I Be, That's Curren$y, Tha Hot Spitta
T Crooked are you, Young rich nigga
I'm up in Cali, wheelin ya lowrider bicycles
He talk a good one but you niggaz can't
I'ma pull the cannons out, make you wish and blow your candles out
Raised by the streets, see-Murder show me what a man about
Gangstas never flinch and when they sent, get their hands out
You niggaz what richboys real riding on them spinning wheels, on a cadillac deville
I'ma say what I feel and back it up with the steel
Get it even if I have to jeapordize my deal

And still tryin' stay true with my frist meal 

Cause in the ghetto, you got money, you might get killed 

And stayin' TRU to the game, is a part of life 

And if you don't player, you might lose your life 



-chorus- 

Tru 2 da game, Tru 2 da game 

Ain't nothin' changed but my bank account 

I'm still the same 



[Silkk the Shocker] 

Tryin' to have things major, they can't fade me 

cash the chips like casino 

Today I'm a keep it real, and chill, and get blitzed like Marino 

My girl be fussin', she be tussin', constantly buggin' 

Askin' me why I be hustlin' 

I got money to make, so motherfuck it 

I'm a keep it real, if it kills me 

y'all gonna feel me before I'm done 

Ball till I have it all, I want the whole while 

if not, I don't want none 

Why I hang with the same ol' niggas 

That's what they ask me 

I be like, I'm the same ol' nigga 

But 'stead, right now, I gets my sacks free 

I gots to stay TRU fool, about my motherfuckin' mail 

I'll be a rich ass nigga, y'all gonna be visitin' me in the jail 

I gots to ball, can't fall, gotta have things major 

If you don't believe me, next year round this time 

its Silkk up on his pager (then ask me) 



-chorus- 



[Big Ed] 

Bustas can't see me, they blind 

I claim TRU, I thought you knew 

My foes catch elbows, cause I'm on em like a tattoo 

Man I'm layin' low like the eyes of a danked out china man 

Stayin' gangstafied 

While I'm tryin' to make a million 

But politicians run for office 

They rather me bust a cap in a rat, cause they both gonna try and stop 

this 

Gangsta rap is what they call it 

But I gots to come with the realness 

So all my folks can feel this 



-chorus- 



[Mr. Serv-On] 

Now I lay me down to sleep 

I pray the Lord that my momma will never weep 

and let her live in peace and stop spendin' a hundred G's up in her sleep 

When will it stop 

I guess when they leave me lyin' on the block 

With tears on my glock 

A pocket full of lemon drops, laughin' at crooked cops 

I guess I'm doin' what I gotta do 

As long as I stay TRU, until they put me through 

I know its a shame, things'll never change 

I hope I live long enough to see my daughter spell my name 

I'm TRU 2 Da Game 



-chorus- 



[Master P] 

still the same 

Master P, the whole TRU click (y'all gonna feel this) 

TRU to the gizame (tru to da hood) 

money can't change you, it just can make you 

(never forget where i came from) 

No Limit Records, Down South Hustlers (independent black owned) 

and the West Coast Bad Boyz 

and I told y'all, I can drop something anytime I want to 

y'all done realized by now, the haters done fell off 

Cause they ain't TRU 2 da game 

I could never forget where I came from 

I'm from the ghetto 

But I won't ever change 

Cause I'm TRU 2 da game, believe that 

Keepin' it real, keepin' it real 

Never sell out, can never sell out

Game so smooth that's why they want me
Ooh too cool way to flossy

I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin

Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that

Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest

Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath.

I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody

And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked

Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business

But something must have snapped

Silkworm,"Drag the river with a comb that you just bought
For a dollar at the drugstore on the font
If you catch a body falling star, falling star
Is it anybody 'cause those has-beens don't fall far
Not like a comet shard, not like a bullet shot at a passing car
Planned from the beginning from the very start
An arrow through the middle of the truest of hearts

The night you beat me up, you said it wouldn't last
And you thought it would sink into the past
But it never could and it never will
I drag the river and I feel it still

That trick sent us into triple overtime and into sudden death
Certain inconsistencies saved us at the net
Like that gentle retardation that I never will forget
I won't forget, not like the time you let, pass you by
Like a comet in the night with its tail shining bright
A poker in the face of a dream pursuing sight

The night you beat me up, you said it wouldn't last
And you thought it would sink into the past
But it never could and it never will
I drag the river and I feel it still

Salt, sugar, water and grease
Run through the veins of the local police
Wide of the target and short of the mark
Like bears in the corner of a national park
They don't bark like dogs or howl at the moon like a wolf in the fog
They never move too fast, too far or too soon

The night you beat me up, you said it wouldn't last
And you thought it would sink into the past
But it never could and it never will
I drag the river and I feel it still
A candy coating on the bitterest pill but I taste it

Silkworm,"I was caught in a bad dream I was locked out on love
I got stuck in the slipstream until I lucked out for once
In the sky behind this club I saw her face high rise
It didn't want to lose it on that miracle mile

But we played at CBGB on a 4th of July 3 a.m.
Sound man wanted to kill us then
He was strung out on Ex-Lax, he was fucked in his lungs
He got shot out on Avenue A while sucking on some slut's tongue
He would dress up like a whore just to get lucky once in a while
I didn't want to lose it on that miracle mile

But then we played at the Knitting Factory for fifteen people
Thirty bucks an' someone broke into the goddamn truck
He had shit in his pants, he had a needle in his arm
He just stole a couple sleeping bags that he needed to stay warm
He couldn't even walk, we found him crawling in a garbage pile
I didn't want to lose it on that miracle mile

But we met with even greater misfortune in the Armpit of the Americas
Four dumb hicks from hunger, we got ripped off by these assholes
At a Fort Lee garage, they didn't weld that motherfucking leaf spring
Now those sparks were a mirage, we hallucinated freely
Huddled shivering on the tile
And I didn't want to lose it on that miracle mile

But six hundred dollars later we were still drinking bad coffee
Couldn't sleep stomachs were full of pizza grease
Well I called her up long-distance there was freezing on the line
Did she trust me, could she throw me with a strong breeze from behind?
Oh, no and no again, no fucking shit a crazy smile
And I didn't want to lose it on that miracle mile

But the stage was set for tension so I cried and I spit
I drooled and wept and I hit the gas for Pittsburgh
I was caught in a bad dream I was out on the nod
I got stuck in the slipstream until I blacked out
Until I blacked out thank God

Clockwise slipping down a clogged drain
In that period two dimensions out of three
Tried to fit it like a broken chain
The mirror can't explain to the crowd
Just how the con went down
Tonight's act is in a double lined garbage bag
For your pleasure with a top hat and cane
In the quicksand you're on land and you're offshore
In the quicksand, it's on land and offshore

Ever wonder why people disappear?
Sucked under by the day's tight undertow
A thick accumulation of boredom and fear
On a raft made out of rotten sticks
Caught on a sea of bad risks
Catch it soon, is that the seventh wave
Don't dawdle over twice tried failures
Have you ever seen how those wolves behave?
Quicksand you're on land and you're offshore
Quicksand you're on land and you're offshore

Ever wonder why there's a house that sits
As empty as the day that someone finished building it?
Birds on the highway, rat on the porch
They're singing to the people who used to live next door
They don't answer that phone anymore

And commemorated the occasion with his gin and my juice

""No"" with a chuckle, ""I'm not drunk I feel so fine""

Lay it down in full view
Lay it down in full view

Well stuck there on the D train where it heads above ground
Into a scene of blasted buildings
Where the drunks go to fall down
Starin' out the window asked about Secona Lee
""And Luke, do me a favor, never mention that to me""

And lay it down in full view

He's still starin' out the window as I pat myself on the back
And I feel a little better 'cause I'll never end like that

Dann ein ganzes Magazin auf dein Kamerateam
Bevor sie vor den Cops auf der Yamaha fliehen
Adrenalinschub, Testo im Blut
Hol dir Deckung, wenn du ins im Ghetto besuchst
Respektlose Jugend, kein Pfadfindertrupp
Ich trag in der Hood mein Schlagring als Schmuck, yeah
Was los? Wir sind Aggro
Ich Schlag dir Bastard dein Glaskinn kaputt
Bandenkrieg, was ist Beef? Zücke die Gun und schieß
Abaz Beats, Explosiv, Panzerminen
Maskulin, mein Flow ist ungestreckt
Ich kenn keinen Paragraphen aus dem Grundgesetz
Ich kenn nur Para, gib die Kohle her
Rechne ab mit Präzisionsgewehr. K-killa!

Gangs in der Street, bang zu dem Beat
Aus dem Fenster des Jeeps,es gibt Drive-By
Aggressiv, jetzt brennt dieser Kiez
Ihr kennt dieses Lied. Das ist Teil 3
Bandenkrieg Frankfurt bis Wien
Vom Hamburger Kiez bis Slums in Paris
Bandenkrieg, Standort Berlin
Von Ruanda bis Kiew, lad die Gun nach und schieß, yeah!

Du bist ein dünner Lauch wie Günther Jauch
Ich bin Silla der Killa ich seh gesünder aus
Im Training läuft wie Mario Gomes
Am Cheatday ess ich Majo mit Pommes
Zum Burger brauch ich literweise Ketchup
Mach Workout-Pause wie ein kleiner Fettsack
Nach der Pizza wird 'ne Pizza bestellt
Ich fühl mich wie der faulste Wichser der Welt
Hägen-Dazs und Hot Wings, Käseplatten, Softdrinks
Ich kauf alles was ein Kiffer gefällt
Weil ich schwerfällig wie mit Gipsfüßen lauf
Reiß ich heute höchstens ein Paar Chipstüten auf

Es ist Cheatday, heut ist alles erlaubt
Cheatday, ich lass mich fallen auf die Couch
Cheatday, ich hab die ganze Woche trainiert
Heute nehm ich alles doppelt frittiert
Keine Diät, keine Kalorien zähl'n
Ich glaub ich werd' schon wieder fit bis zum Releaseday
Keine Beefsteaks heute gibt es Cheesecake
Es ist Cheatday

Statt den Magerquark nachdem ich die Crunches mach
Gibs Oreo White und danach die Crunchy Nuts
Heute hab ichs irgendwie mit den Bandscheiben
Ich lass mich vom Dr. Pepper krank schreiben
So ein Pech aber heute fällt das Training aus
Bestell ein Big Mac und auch noch Bacon drauf
Statt dem Putensteak nach dem Bankdrücken
Gibt es Ben & Jerrys satt nach dem Lammrücken
Heute scheiß ich mal auf Hanteln stemm'n, yeah
Ich will mir die Lasage gönnen
Normalerweise ess ich sonst ein Apfel
Heut lad ich mich selber ein zu Wonder Waffle
Oh mein Gott, Cola shopp', was tue ich mein'm Körper an?
Wenn ich vom Hühnershop rüberschauh ins Bürgeramt
Ich schieße Pics und schiebe miesen Fress-Flash
Sonntag ist mein Lieblings-Hashtag

Ich hab mir Cookies & Cream und den Pudding verdient
Vom Schulterblatt zu den Achillessehnen
Bin ich fit, pass den Blunt und die Vanillecreme, yeah
Ich achte nicht auf Preise oder Fettgehalt
Ich bin noch jung und kassiere fett Gehalt
Schau mir zu wie ich die Pringles poppe
Die hab'n heut Vorzug, vor jedem heißen Fitnessmodell
Es wird sich keinen Zentimeter bewegt
Nur die Fernbedienung ist mein Trainingsgerät
Ich muss runterkomm'n, von dem Stress hier am Block
Den Geschäfte mit Ott sind meine Realität
Fitness hat mich vor dem Abgrund bewahrt
Meine Psyche gestärkt als ich ganz unten lag
Die Seele ist die Summe von Körper und Geist

Vielleicht ist es 'ne Flucht aus dieser Schlucht
Und nicht grad heldenhaft
Ich kann nicht länger auf mein Glück in dieser Wohnung warten
Hab' mich entschieden, alten Zeiten Lebewohl zu sagen
Dich zu vergessen wird nicht leicht, aber hoffentlich klappt's
Hab' nur das Allernötigste in meinen Koffer gepackt
Ein letzter Blick auf das gemeinsame Bild
Auf meiner weiteren Reise weiß ich, dass keiner mir hilft
Folge mei'm eigenen Willen, d'rum seid mir bitte nicht böse
Ich habe lange gezögert, doch nun mein Ticket gelöst

Es tut mir Leid, Baby, ich bleibe nicht hier
Lass uns zum Abschied noch einmal durch die Scheiben berühren
Das Lehrgeld, das wir zahlen, ist sowas wie die Reisegebühr
Ich kann dir auch nicht sagen, wohin diese Gleise mich führen
Der ganze Staub der Stadt rauscht an mir vorbei
Ich glaub, ich fühl mich erst im Ausland wieder frei
Will nur fliehen von diesem Ort, ich glaub es zieht mich wieder fort
Ich war noch niemals in New York oder am Traumstrand auf Hawaii
Jeder hat die Chance, also schau, dass du deinen Platz bekommst
Sonst endest du noch dort ganz hinten im Ersatzwaggon
Viele versuchten mich von der Fährte abzubringen
Doch ich drängel, bis ich schließlich in der ersten Klasse bin
Bis zum Ziel fährt man auf etlichen Schienen
Viele Beziehungen sind auf der Strecke geblieben

Will ankommen, doch mein nächstes Ziel
Bleibt wieder nur ein Zwischenstopp
Fühl' mich lebendig, wenn ich ständig in Bewegung bin
Das Glück folgt keinem Plan, deshalb kommt es zu Verspätungen
Wolken überschatten hier das ganze Gebiet
Muss auf die Sonnenseite, bevor die Schranke sich schließt
Ich steige aus, hinter mir schließen sich leise die Türen
Bin endlich da, um auch einen kleinen Hauch von Freiheit zu spüren

Geshreddet wie The Rock, auch ohne Testo und Stoff
Lauf mit erhobenem Haupt vom Ghetto raus in Frank's Loft
Und geh' allerhöchstens nur in Deckung vor den Dreckscops
Glaub mir, dass ich alles totsicher lohnt

Der Schwache wird gefressen nur der Starke überlebt

Ich lebte immer nach dem Kodex auf der Street

Hab den Part schon geschrieben
Gegen 10 nach, wird es Zeit den Tag zu geniessen
Bitte frag nicht wie viele Leute ungefähr zum Auftritt komm’n

Nachdem ich aufgenommen habe bin ich draussen auf der Strasse
Kurz darauf, läufst du Clown mir vor die Nase
Stellst mir tausende von Fragen hälst mich auf
Stehst genau vor meinem Wagen bist in Plauderlaune
Hör auf mir zu raten
Ich könnte doch mein Image mal nach aussen hin erneuern
Mein Album war nur durchschnitt und ausserdem zu teuer
Deshalb bist du also auch so ein Kritiker
Denkst dir CD’s werden auch nicht mehr billiger
Und saugst dir die illegal

Silla,"Reflektion, ich lauf allein durch Süd-Berlin
Die Headphones auf meinen Ohren spielen den Über-Beat
Die ersten Orgi-Touren führten mich durchs ganze Land
Mit dem Song ''Komm Komm'' hat alles angefangen
JokA, weißt du noch? Wir schrieben Parts im Kinderzimmer
Heut werde ich nostalgisch, wenn ich mich erinner
Hotbox vor dem Haus, während Mo die Texte flowt
Jeder Reim, jede Line war so unendlich dope
Für das „Jeder Tag“-Video fuhr ich Pizzen aus
Heute habe ich meinen Clio gegen 4 Millionen Klicks getauscht
Die beste Zeit ist die Zeit bevor man durchstartet
Nächte um die Ohren schlagen, kurz mal durchatmen
Dann ging es weiter, von da an waren wir Schnelles Geld
Wer du sein willst, entscheidest du am Ende selbst
Ich entschied mich für die Jungs, entschied mich für die Kunst
Und für die CD, die du in deinen Händen hälst

An manchen Tagen ging es auf und ab
Sie gaben mir die Kraft, meine Freunde 
haben mich niemals enttäuscht
Ich hab nichts anderes als Liebe für euch

Wenn ich mich zurück erinner, seh ich mich in meinem Zimmer sitzen
Jeder Vers ging vom Herz bis in die Fingerspitzen
Und ich schrieb tausend Strophen
Gott sei Dank hab ich sie aufgehoben
Und nicht gleich alles wieder hingeschmissen
Ich war am Ende, dabei fing die Reise gerade an
Große Kunst, Texte mit dem Pinsel schreiben, Tage lang
Auch wenn ich im Lager stand von 2 bis um 7
JokA, weißt du noch? Du hast mir bei MySpace geschrieben
Und danach habe ich dich sofort besucht
Heute sind wir keine Partner mehr
Wir sind Bro's bis aufs Blut, Schnelles Geld, Silla sagte mir genieß diese Zeit
Denn so schön wie am Anfang wird es nie wieder sein
Und ich wollt nicht wirklich daran glauben, unser Weg verlief eher schief
Doch wir sehen das Ziel klar vor Augen, meine Texte, meine Reflektion
Alles was mich heute interessiert, sind diese 16 Bars in Perfektion

Am Anfang meiner Reise fühlte ich mich wie ein Fremder
Es lief nicht immer rund bei mir es hat sich viel verändert
Früher machte ich ein paar Scheine auf die Schnelle
Heutzutage finde ich keine freie Stelle im Terminkalender
Ich bin viel rumgekommen in dieser Zeit
Geld was ich für Zugtickets brauchte, holten Auftritte wieder rein
Auch wenn ich heute meine Rechnungen bezahlen kann
Ist dieses Leben das ich lebe wirklich besser als damals?
Silla, weißt du noch? Trip war da noch nirgens gesignt
Nach „Cover my Song“ stand plötzlich Universal bereit
Ich war bei I luv Money als du dann zu Maskulin gingst
Ich bin stolz heute machst du dein Ding, und jetzt macht alles Sinn
Denn wir sind endlich auf dem richtigen Weg
Ihr seid Familie, auch wenn wir uns nicht so oft sehen
Und ich weiß, all der Druck in diesem Spiel ist enorm
Doch trotz allem hab ich niemals meine Liebe verloren, ah

Bruder glaub mir Rap ist da für dich
Auf wen ist noch Verlass in der Not
Rap ist mein Leben Rap ist Wasser und Brot

Alle Leute wollen mehr
Es wird Zeit ihr habt lang genug gewartet jetzt
Silla ich bin unterwegs mit Trip Hier in Aachen-West
Ticken auf den Strassen Packs, rauchen sich ein
Blicken auf die Stars im Netz und woll’n genau wie sie sein
Schrei nach Aufmerksamkeit
Keiner hört’s wenn dir die Stimme fehlt
Rap ist verlieren und gewinnen, nur dein Wille zählt
Noch einmal hinten stehen dann rette dich ins Ziel
Es wird zu viel aber Rap ist dein Ventil
Wenn dich die Stille quält
Risiken hinzunehmen um in der Szene Fuss zu fassen
Neues sehen und die Veränderung auch zuzulassen
Lass ein Feuer in der Glut entfachen, Du bist Anders
Wurdest geboren um es gut zu machen, Du bist Anders
Sei so gut du kannst, hochmotiviert
Dann musst du mit Keinem gross diskutieren
Wir sind wo? Wir sind hier
Davon haben wir jahrelang geträumt
Es ist soviel passiert, deshalb frag ich dich erneut

Was ist Rap für dich?
Rap ist unser Weg und wird uns leiten
Rap bedeutet dass wir leben was wir schreiben
Bruder sag mir was ist Rap für dich?
Rap ist wenn die Strasse dich erzieht
Rap verbindet uns von Aachen bis Berlin
Bruder glaub mir Rap ist da für dich
Ich hab den Teufel geseh’n
Rap ist der Grund warum wir heute hier steh’n
Bruder glaub mir Rap ist da für dich
Auf wen ist noch Verlass in der Not

Silla,"Ah ok, pass auf

Egal wie schnell, sie sprintet mir davon
Ich muss nach vorn und doch sitz' hinten im Wagon
Und irgendwann mal erklingt dann dieser Gong
Der Sommer geht zu Ende und der Winter hat begonnen
Zeit ist Geld, in meinem Viertel hat man Zeit
Ich war jahrelang verpeilt, und hing als Kind schon an der Bong
Doch schon seit der Geburt beginnt der Marathon
Wir versuchen an dem Ziel als Gewinner anzukommen
Mit jeden Tag den du nicht nutzt verringert sich die Chanche
Manche hören auf zu laufen und springen vom Balkon
Zeit ist unser kostbarstes Gut
Nicht das Geld, ich muss dich daran erinnern mit dem Song
Der Zeit voraus zu sein ist der schwierigste Schritt
In dem Spiel, wo nur Gott der Schiedsrichter ist
Egal ob Swatch oder Audemars Piguet
Ich lauf der Zeit hinterher bis ich die rote Karte seh

Bin verloren in dieser Sanduhr
Und niemand bricht das Glas
Seh' die Welt nur durch die Scheibe
Sie dreht sich schneller, Tag für Tag
Und die Luft wird immer dünner
Zeit rinnt mir durch die Finger
Ich muss raus aus dieser Sanduhr
Doch wer bricht das Glas?

Ah, Es gibt zum warten keinen Grund
Noch vor paar Jahren waren wir kleine Jungs
Und hingen Jahre auf der Hasenheide rum
Ich stoppte die Zeit, mit Grass in meinen Lungen
Dann brachte mich der Alk um Haaresbreite um
Die Art der Menschen, sie schlägt wie Jahreszeiten um
Die Texte an der Wand, sind weg irgendwann
Unsere Spuren, beseitigt durch die Straßenreinigung
Die Uhr tickt, sitzt wie ein Galgen im Genick
Gestern Pickel, heute Falten im Gesicht
Doch wenn alles hier zerbricht und die Zeit mir alles nimmt
Die Erinnerung behalte ich für mich
Halt immer Schritt, such weiter nach dem Sinn
Zumindest eine kleine Epoche gestalte ich hier mit
Egal ob Swatch oder Submariner
Komm aus dem Bett, lauf als Etappensieger

Bin verloren in dieser Sanduhr
Und niemand bricht das Glas
Seh die Welt nur durch die Scheibe
Sie dreht sich schneller, Tag für Tag
Und die Luft wird immer dünner
Zeit rinnt mir durch die Finger
Ich muss raus aus dieser Sanduhr
Doch wer bricht das Glas?

Steh nich' da bis sie einfach an dir vorbeirennt

Ein betörender Duft holt uns aus der Gruft

Enorme Dekolletees und Heldenbrust-Toupees
Alle am Start und jeder paart sich auf seine Art

Brennen lüstern die Pupillen hinter sündhaft teuren Brillen
Downtown gibtÄs die heißesten Frau'n
Und die fettesten Ratten mit den grellsten Krawatten

Auf Kälte und Frust haben wir keine Lust mehr
Was soll die blöde Frage, man sieht doch
Die Lage der Nation ist nun mal horizontal, wirklich genial

And miss it each night and day

Where mockingbirds used to sing

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Silver Stars,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Silverchair,"I live for yesterday
No one cares or understands
Don't feel pain, I'm made of steel
I can't answer you
If you ask me how I am 'cause I,
I don't know just how I feel

I can feel
Any pain you give me
But I'll take it and throw it away

I'm a hypocrite
But that's okay 'cause I do like it
But I am careful who I burn
I am free falling
With no parachute at all, but
I don't have any concerns

I can feel
Any pain you give me
But I'll take it and throw it away
I will kneel

Drive away from the past

A metal box drifting off course is taking everything

When will someone wake me?

Before the animals were poached to extinction

This vessel was to venture into new waters 
To find new resources to make life easier and more enjoyable 
It was a simple mission for the crew, who were excited to be a part of this union 
They pledged their allegiance to the captain and vowed to be there no matter what 
In sickness, health, and possible death
As time passed by, there was no new land to be found
As the days grew shorter 
And the nights grew longer and colder 
The crew became more and more skeptical about the captain's vision 
Originally passionate and committed to being true and faithful, they now began to revolt

I was honest and never promised anything
Just a brotherhood to stand for something
And everyone should take the lead
Follow your dreams
If you don't try you fail

And we started
And the captain went over
He asked them why
Their lives had changed

No treasure in the ground
We won't die for this
We won't die for you

Run away as fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at you)

Run away as fast as you can

Okay '24/7, 365 groupies stay on their grind,
I, I, I get it, alright I’ll help you get it,
but now that you’re here either leave or get with it. 
I’m not a chauvinist, this is just reality,
you can’t afford guilt on a rock band salary.
Mickey full of vodka, you’re looking like mallory. 
Fuck counting money, you should stick to counting calories. 
Let me tell you this thing here is where it ends, 
unless you’ve got a couple friends that want sharing in. 
Yesterday you were outside staring in, 
and now you’re here and next week you’ll be here for them.
Every tour bus visit every laminate,
comes with expectations from that band you’re with.
This is everyday business, so manage it,
or runaway now if your ass can’t handle it

Never was much of a romantic,
I could never take the intimacy.
And I know I did damage,
'cause the look in your eyes is killing me,
I guess you knew of an advantage
'cause you could blame me for everything.
And I don't know how I'm a manage,
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can",Runaway,2011
Silverstein,"The artist's palette falls

Left him without a soul

With hopes to resurrect

Now they decide who lives and dies, now
His peers won't come around
They're too disgraced to face

We fight through and prevail
We don't stop where you'd be giving up
We won't ever fail

A martyr takes his hand
To make him live again
With savage sleight of hand
He'll force his legs to stand

A sick and gutless joke
A serenading hoax
Interrupted peace
A waste of time
A pathetic excuse for hope

The sleepless nights have no compassion
And the dreams that come aren't true
A charade of lies unconscious
With so much left to be proved

But the sun will rise and fall again
And the nights will start to shorten
The memories will fade into darkness
You can't let it go

Bur your world is turned upside down
It's a panic you can't release
Once you have it, you just can't

Beside the tarmac you never came clean

Games we used to play
Could take the pain away

The last step in killing the karma
It makes sense from where we've been
The same car same songs same motions
We hold hands, relive how we met
But no talk, no reconciliation
This train's already left
Did you think next April
You'd be even further away
Did you keep him faithful
How many nights did you lay awake
And even six years later
The dialogue, it stays the same
You're 2000 miles away
Betrayers never change
 
A ring in a box but not from me

But thereʼs no time, I look up into headlights

yo pregunto si eres moza y tus amigas te dicen qué hacer
no te escondas, ¿o no te gustó esa noche que vivimos de placer?
y a mí me gusta que valoren lo que soy 
A ti te gusta que te quieran nada más

Si te arrepentiste para estar conmigo 
Todo aqui se acaba, no eres mi destino 
Si ya tienes novio y a mí me rumbeaste 
Pobre del muchacho, cacho le pegaste 
Y si no te acuerdas lo que prometiste 
Controla esos tragos porque asi no sirve

ten seguro que me voy

Ay, me vuelve loco tu hermosura

Silvestre Dangond,"Qué buscas tú en mi alma 
Qué quieres mi vida de mí 
No ves que ya no hay nada 
Que no hay palabras que decir 

O acaso se te olvidan 
Ay!, tus manos diciéndome adiós 
Cómo es que no recuerdas 
Mis ojos llorando tu amor 

Que desde aquel momento 
Siento que vivo del dolor 
Y le ha quitado fuerza 
Al viento y a mi corazón 

Aún recuerdo la gaviota 
Que voló un día llevándose entre sus alas 
El alma mía y me hizo llorar 

Sabía que la amaba tanto 
Quién no sabía cuándo la estaba adorando 
Cuánto sentía y se echó a volar 

Y una gaviota linda yo vi alejar 
Llevándose mi vida, mi vida y más 
Y una gaviota linda yo vi alejar 
Llevándose mi vida, mi vida y más 

Quedó sin una estrella el cielo por ti 
Y la noche en tinieblas fue mi vivir 
Alguien dijo en la tarde se oyó el gemir 
De un hombre muy solitario por su sentir 

Solo por la gaviota que un día voló 
Y se llevó mi vida más que sé yo 
Solo por la gaviota que un día voló 
Y se llevó mi vida más que sé yo 

Dicen que el que se aleja 
Más fácil se le hace olvidar 
Pero aquel que se queda 
Siempre el recuerdo vivirá 

De tanto sentimiento 
Ay! El alma quiso doblegar 
Y el corazón sufriendo 
Queriendo el recuerdo matar 

Hasta la piel me siento 
Que el sol me quemó sin cesar 
Testigo fue el silencio 
Que el llanto me hizo desahogar 

Sé que en las playas del mar 
Las olas mueren y otras también volverán 
Por muy rebeldes también morirán 

Has llegado a tu final 
Y eso me duele sé que muy triste estarás 
También me hiere pero es el final 

Adiós gaviota herida vuelve a volar 
Solo tu llanto libre te aliviará 
Adiós gaviota herida vuelve a volar 
Solo tu llanto libre te aliviará

Siempre se ríe y se llora por un amor 
Porque de alguna ausencia nace el dolor 
Aunque con la esperanza va la ilusión 
Queda una honda herida en el corazón 

Solo por la gaviota que un día voló 
Y se llevó mi vida más que sé yo 

Solo por la gaviota 
Y se llevó mi vida más que sé yo
Solo por la gaviota 
Y se llevó mi vida más que sé yo",Gaviota Herida,2009

Quería una princesa convertida en un dragón
Quería el hacha de un brujo para echarla en mi zurrón
Quería un vellosino de oro para un reino
Quería que Virgilio me llevara al infierno
Quería ir hasta el cielo en un frijol sembrado y ya

De lejos vi una fuente que brillaba 
Y corrí hacia ella
Pues tenía aguas de oro
Era inconfundible aquel color como miel

El sol se reflejaba en la fuente abandonada 
Y supe 
Que era el sol el que brillaba 
Desilusionado por dos veces me alejé

Quería una princesa convertida en un dragón
Quería el hacha de un brujo para echarla en mi zurrón
Quería un vellosino de oro para un reino
Quería que virgilio me llevara al infierno
Quería ir hasta el cielo en un frijol sembrado y ya

Después de mil fracasos como estos 
Me sentí muy tonto
Nos habían engañado
Y me fui a buscar al primer hombre que mintió

Caminé los caminos
Recorrí los recorridos
Pero cuando hallé al culpable 
Hecho un mar de lágrimas, al verme, me pidió

Yo quiero una princesa convertida en un dragón
Yo quiero el hacha de un brujo para echarla en mi zurrón
Yo quiero un vellosino de oro para un reino
Yo quiero que Virgilio me lleve al infierno 
Yo quiero ir hasta el cielo en un frijol sembrado y ya",La Primera Mentira,1982
Silvio Rodríguez,"Un corazón quiso saltar un pozo 
Confiado en la proeza de su sangre 
Y hoy se le escucha delirar de hambre 
En el oscuro fondo de su gozo

El corazón se ahogaba de ternura
De ganas de vivir multiplicado
Y hoy es un corazón tan mutilado 
Que ha conseguido morir de cordura

Qué son, desangrado son, corazón

Hablo de un corazón que se defiende 
De su vieja y usada maquinaria
Hablo de un parto en una funeraria
Hablo de un corazón que no comprende

Hablo de un corazón tan estrujado
Tan pequeñín, tan pobre, tan quién sabe 
Que en su torrente casi todo cabe 
Sea real o sea imaginado

Qué son, desangrado son, corazón

Al corazón le faltaba su oreja 
Y andaba distraído por la calle 
Estrangulando con pasión un talle 
E incapaz de notar alguna queja

El corazón de torpe primavera 
Hizo que le injertaran el oído 
Y tanta maldicion oyó que ha ido 
A que le den de nuevo su sordera

Qué son, desangrado son, corazón",Son Desangrado,1982

Las nubes de la mañana son, un flor

Y la capa de un viejo da, con una
Tempestad de comején

Mucho mas, allá de mi ventana 
Algodones jugaban a ser un jardín
En espera de abril

Luego entro los ojos
Chorreando esa luz de infinito
Y es cuando necesito 
Un perro, un bastón, una mano, una fe
Y tu pasas tocando 
El frio con suave silencio 
Y, ciego, te sentencio
A que nombres todo lo que ahora no se

Silvio Rodríguez,"Si me levanto temprano
Fresco y curado
Claro y feliz
Y te digo: voy al bosque 
Para aliviarme de ti
Sabe que dentro tengo un tesoro 
Que me llega a la raíz
Si luego vuelvo cargado 
Con muchas flores 
(Mucho color) 
Y te las pongo en la risa
En la ternura, en la voz
Es que he mojado en flor mi camisa 
Para teñir su sudor
Pero si un día me demoro, no te impacientes
Yo volveré más tarde

Será que a la más profunda alegría 
Me habrá seguido la rabia ese día
La rabia simple del hombre silvestre
La rabia bomba —la rabia de muerte
La rabia imperio asesino de niños
La rabia se me ha podrido el cariño
La rabia madre por dios tengo frío
La rabia es mío —eso es mío, sólo mío
La rabia bebo pero no me mojo
La rabia miedo a perder el manojo
La rabia hijo zapato de tierra
La rabia dame o te hago la guerra
La rabia todo tiene su momento
La rabia el grito se lo lleva el viento
La rabia el oro sobre la conciencia
La rabia coño paciencia paciencia

La rabia es mi vocación

Si hay días que vuelvo cansado
Sucio de tiempo

Es que regreso del mundo
No del bosque, no del sol

Que mataste mi fe
En amores sin porvenir
Que no me queda ya

Y un pretexto para sufrir

Destreza de la esgrima,
Sucesos como un preso,
Amalia abandonada por la bala,

Seguido por un mar
De negros en machete
Y sin encadenar
Ordena a su corneta
El toque de ""A degüello!""
Y a un siglo de distancia
Entona nuestra canción
Y con recia garganta canta,
Espanta lejos la maldición

Y digo que el que se presta 
Para peón del veneno 
Es doble tonto y no quiero

Luego se quieren los guantes

De sentimientos gigantes

Tomando señas, descifrando encrucijadas
Mi cuerpo sigue practicando su cuestión
Cruje mi hueso why se hare la palabra.
Hoy continué domesticando la razón
Llena de asombro ante el día sucedido
Proyecto un rápido boceto de la acción
Trazo versiones que capturo del olvido.
Por eso canto arena
Roca que luego es multitud del agua buena.
Why canto espuma
Cresta que cuando logra ser ya no es ninguna.
He puesto filo al anhelante corazón
Arrojo estrellas a mecharse contra vientos
El sueño ha desencadenado la canción
Why la canción de hoy me sabe a juramento.
La prisa lleva maravilla why lleva error
Pero viajamos sobre rueda encabritada
He despertado en el ojo del ciclón
Cuento millones de agujeros en el alma.
Por eso canto arena
Roca que luego es multitud del agua buena.
Why canto espuma
Cresta que cuando logra ser ya no es ninguna.
Hoy continué tomando rumbo a mi región
Con dulce látigo de abeja en la conciencia
Hoy me perdí amar con planificación
Pero gane a lo que partió con la prudencia.
Hoy continué dándole cuerda a mi reloj
Con timbre atado sobre número invisible
Poco me importa donde rompa mi estación
Si cuando rompe está rompiendo lo imposible.
Por eso canto arena
Roca que luego es multitud del agua buena.
Why canto espuma
Cresta que cuando logra ser ya no es ninguna.

Why en las trastienda de una bala un militar que no ha dormido

Con un puñado de promesas por crecer 
Y amar 

Pero salio el sol 
Y se elevo sobre la tierra siempre mas 
Secando el frio nocturnal dando calor 
Regocijando al mundo con su prodigar 
Irguiendo al viento el poderoso corazon 
De amar 

Y su luz subió 
Saltando las montanas traspasando el mar 
Resgando el mundo con su cálida verdad 
Su cálida razón 
Esparciendo la claridad 
Como una estación 

Era bello el sol 
Que se elevaba sobre el mundo siempre mas 
Con su destierro de nevadas su canción 
Su semillero en jubiloso despertar 
Erguido al viento el poderoso corazon 
De amar 

Y su luz llego 
Al reino oscuro a las torres del ayer 
Y la cimiente arrebatada de su amor 
Sintiose renacer 
Al contacto de su calor 
Y de su quehacer 

Luego al final 
A la hora en que se suponía atardecer 
Sintieron que la luz quedo en su respirar 
Como una sangre de la atmósfera un poder 
Un pacto eterno con la claridad solar",Leyenda,1992
Silvio Rodríguez,"Me acosa el carapálida que carga sobre mí 
Sobre mi pueblo libre sobre mi día feliz 
Me acosa con la espuela, el sable y el arnes 
Caballería asesina de antes y después 
Me acosa el carapálida norteño por el sur
El este y el oeste, por cada latitud 
Me acosa el carapálida que ha dividido el sol 
En hora de metralla y hora de dolor 
La tierra me quiere arrebatar 
El agua me quiere arrebatar 
El aire me quiere arrebatar 
Y sólo fuego, y sólo fuego voy a dar 
Yo soy mi tierra, mi agua, mi aire, mi fuego

Me acosa el carapálida con el engaño vil 
Con cuentas de colores, con trueque de uno a mil 
Me acosa con su elixir de la prostitución 
Me acosa con la gloria perdida de su dios 
Me acosa el carapálida con su forma de ver 
Su estética, su ángulo, su estilo, su saber 
Me acosa el carapálida con sintetización 
Y quiere hundirme el alma con tuercas de robot 
La tierra

Me acosa el carapálida con la guerra sutil 
Hasta que digo basta y carga sobre mí 
Me acosa con su monstruo de radiactividad 
Su porvenir de arena, su muerte colosal 
Me acosa el carapálida que siempre me acosó 
Que acosa a mis hermanos, que acosa mi razón 
Me acosa el carapálida que vive de acosar 
Hasta que todos juntos le demos su lugar 
La tierra",Me Acosa el Carapalida,1992
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hay una canción comenzada cien veces
Y creo que es la imposible canción
Porque cada vez que la empiezo, aparece
La voz que no alcanza mi pobre razón
Hay una canción que se desvanece
Y deja mis labios en la tentación

Hay que vivir para ver
Como ha sabido crecer
Tanto misterio en la flor
Hay que vivir para ver
Cuanto es difícil saber
Que signo lleva el amor

Hay una canción que se asusta de verme
No se lo que dice, no se lo que ve
Pero algo me lleva al rincón donde duerme
Y me hace velarla una y otra vez
Hay una canción que no quiere saberme
Aunque deja un rastro brillante a mis pies

Hay que vivir

Hay una canción que se va cuando llego
Sospecho se trata de un tema total
Un ama de llaves de todos los juegos
Un pájaro eterno y un sol colosal
Hay una canción que me esconde su fuego
Hay una canción que sera mi final

Hay que vivir",Que Signo Lleva el Amor,1992
Silvio Rodríguez,"Me decido a tararearte 
Todo lo que se te extraña
Desde el siglo en que partiste 
Hasta el largo día de hoy

Me acompaño de guitarra
Porque yo no se de cartas
Y además ya tú conoces 
Que ella va donde yo voy

Lo único que me consuela 
Es que uso dos almohadas
Y que ya no me torturo
Cuando te hago trasnochar

Otro alivio es que en su árbol 
Los pajaritos del alba
Siguen ensayando el coro 
Con que te bienvenirán

El teléfono persiste 
En coleccionar absurdos
Embromarme sigue siendo 
Un deporte universal

Y la puerta está comida 
Donde la ha golpeado el mundo 
Cuando menos una buena parte 
De la humanidad

El cine de enamorados 
Tuvo un par de buenas pistas
Nuestro cabaret privado 
Sigue activo por su bar

Se nos sigue desangrando 
La llave de la cocina
Y yo sigo sin canciones 
Habiendo necesidad

Pueden ser casualidades 
U otras rarezas que pasan
Pero donde quiera que ando 
Todo me conduce a tí

Especialmente la cas 
Me resulta insoportable
Cuando desde sus rincones 
Te abalanzas sobre mí

No exagero si te cuento 
Que le hablo a tu fantasma
Que le solicito agua 
Y hasta el buche de café

En días graves le he pedido 
Masajes para mi espalda
Los peores ni te cuento 
Porque no vas a creer

Hay días que en tu sacrificio 
Acaricio tu fantasma
Pero donde iba el delirio 
No oigo tu respiración

Siempre termino en lo mismo
Asesino tu fantasma
Y la diana me sorprende 
Recostado en el balcón

Ya no sé si lo que digo 
Realmente nos hace falta
Hoy no es día inteligente 
Y no sé ir más allá

Pero cuando puedas, vuelve
Porque acecha tu fantasma
Jugando a las escondidas 
Y yo estoy muy viejo ya

Pero cuando puedas, vuelve
Porque acecha tu fantasma
Jugando a las escondidas 
Y yo estoy muy viejo ya",Tu Fantasma,1992
Silvio Rodríguez,"A veces siento deseos de amor 
Y a menudo no puedo beber 
Para esa hora busque una canción 
Con la que me entretengo la sed 

Tiene delirios de la tradición 
Y otras hierbas que suelo rumiar 
Ya te las voy a cantar

Yo soy como soy 
Y a casi todo el mundo le pedí prestado 
Yo soy como soy 
Y a casi todo el mundo yo le tiendo mano 
Y a casi todo el mundo yo le tiendo mano 
Y a casi todo el mundo yo le tiendo 

Dime que pena te puedo sanar 
Yo quisiera también ser doctor 
Solo deseo que para tu mal 
Tenga alivio mi vieja canción 
Lo que te doy de mortal a mortal 
Se desprende gustoso de mi 
El resto espera por ti 

Yo soy como soy

Se que hay amores que no curara 
Ni la mas esmerada canción 
En todo caso te invito a llenar 
De optimismo este buen corazón 
Vale la pena dejar de llorar 
Y hacer cita con el porvenir 
Vale la pena vivir 

Yo soy como soy",Yo Soy Como Soy,1992
Silvio Rodríguez,"Yo te quiero libre, libre y con amor
Libre de la sombra, pero no del sol
Yo te quiero libre, como te viví
Libre de otras penas, y libre de mi

La libertad tiene alma clara
Y solo canta cuando va batiendo alas
Vuela y canta, libertad
La libertad nació sin dueño
Y yo quien soy para robarle cada sueno

Yo te quiero libre y con buena fe
Para que conduzcas tu preciosa sed
Yo te quiero libre, libre de verdad
Libre como el sueno de la libertad

La libertad, nació sin dueño
Y yo quien soy para robarle cada sueno

Yo te quiero libre como te viví
Libre de otras penas, y libre de mi",Yo Te Quiero Libre,1992
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hoy viene a mí­ 
La damisela soledad

Viene tan despacio, 
Viene en una danza 
Leve del espacio

Lenta, como el tul 
En la brisa suave, 
Niña del azul

Silvio Rodríguez,"Si te dijera, amor mío, 
Que temoa a la madrugada, 
No sé qué estrellas son estas 
Que hieren como amenazas, 
Ni sé qué sangra la luna 
Al filo de su guadaña. 
Presiento que tras la noche 
Vendrá la noche más larga, 
Quiero que no me abandones 
Amor mío, al alba. 
Los hijos que no tuvimos 
Se esconden en las cloacas, 
Comen las últimas flores, 
Parece que adivinaran 
Que el día que se avecina 
Viene con hambre atrasada. 
Presiento que tras la noche

Miles de buitres callados 
Van extendiendo sus alas, 
No te destroza, amor mío, 
Esta silenciosa danza, 
Maldito baile de muertos, 
Pólvora de la mañana. 
Presiento que tras la noche",Al Alba,1994

los montes de tu mapa,

secreta de tu alma

pídeme que viole 
las leyes que te encarnan, 
que no quede intacto 
ni un poro en la batalla,

Silvio Rodríguez,"Enemigo de la guerra
Y su reverso, la medalla
No propuse otra batalla
Que librar al corazón
De ponerse cuerpo a tierra
Bajo el paso de una historia
Que iba a alzar hasta la gloria
El poder de la razón
Y ahora que ya no hay trincheras
El combate es la escalera
Y el que trepe a lo mas alto
Pondrá a salvo su cabeza
Aunque se hunda en el asfalto
La belleza

Míralos, como reptiles
Al acecho de la presa
Negociando en cada mesa
Maquillajes de ocasión
Siguen todos los raíles
Que conduzcan a la cumbre
Locos por que nos deslumbre
Su parásita ambición
Antes iban de profetas
Y ahora el éxito es su meta
Mercaderes, traficantes
Mas que nausea dan tristeza
No rozaron ni un instante
La belleza

Y me hablaron de futuros
Fraternales, solidarios
Donde todo lo falsario
Acabaría en el pilón
Y ahora que se cae el muro
Ya no somos tan iguales
Tanto vendes, tanto vales
¡viva la revolución!
Reivindico el espejismo
De intentar ser uno mismo
Ese viaje hacia la nada
Que consiste en la certeza
De encontrar en tu mirada
La belleza…",La Belleza,1994
Silvio Rodríguez,"Tu sed transubstancia mi sudor 
en vino que bebemos en cada beso 

Tus pies no se hunden 
en los lagos de mis lágrimas. 

Tu saliva siembra la luz 
en la noche de mis ojos. 

Tu voz resucita mis músculos dormidos 
mis latidos sepultados. 

Tus manos, cuando me tocan, curan 
mis heridas más invisibles. 

Tu hambre fecunda peces 
que se multiplican como deseos de humedad 
en el múltiple pan de mi cuerpo. 

cada vez que me amas, 
es un milagro.",Cada Vez Que Me Amas,1994
Silvio Rodríguez,"Fue en ese cine, te acuerdas, 
en una mañana al este del edén, 
James Dean tiraba piedras 
a una casa blanca, entonces te besé. 

Aquella fue la primera 
vez, tus labios parecían de papel, 
y a la salida en la puerta 
nos pidió un triste inspector nuestros carnets. 
Luego volví a la academia 
para no faltar a clases de francés, 
tú me esperaste hora y media 
en esta misma mesa, yo me retrasé. 

Quieres helado de fresa 
o prefieres que te pida ya el café. 
Cuéntame cómo te encuentras 
aunque se que me responderás: muy bien. 
Ten, esta foto es muy fea,

oiga, me trae la cuenta, 
calla, que fui yo quién te invitó a comer.

que no llegues a la hora al almacén.

tendré que olvidarte, 
por mucho que quiera 
no es fácil, ya sabes, 
me faltan las fuerzas, 
ha sido muy tarde, 
y nada más, y nada más,

Las noches te acercan 
y enredas el aire, 
mis labios se secan 
e intento besarte, 
qué fría es la cera 
de un beso de nadie 
y nada más, y nada más, 
apenas nada más. 

Las horas de piedra

Nuestra esperanza

Silvio Rodríguez,"Hay algunos que dicen
que todos los caminos conducen a Roma
why es verdad porque el mío
me lleva cada noche al hueco que te nombra
why le hablo why le suelto
una sonrisa, una blasfemia why dos derrotas;
luego apago tus ojos
why duermo con tu nombre besando mi boca.

Ay, amor mío,
qué terriblemente absurdo
es estar vivo
sin el alma de tu cuerpo,
sin tu latido.

Que el final de esta historia,
enésima autobiografía de un fracaso,
no te sirva de ejemplo,
hay quien afirma que el amor es un milagro
que no hay mal que no cure
pero tampoco bien que le dure cien años;
eso casi lo salva,
lo malo son las noches que mojan mi mano.

Aunque todo ya es nada,
no sé por qué te escondes why huyes de mi encuentro.
Por saber de tu vida
no creo que vulnere ningún mandamiento;
tan terrible es el odio
que ni te atreves a mostrarme tu desprecio,
pero no me hagas caso,
lo que me pasa es que este mundo no lo entiendo.",Sin Tu Latido,1994

Como me haces hablar en el silencio 
Como no te me quitas de las ganas 
Aunque nadie me ve nunca contigo 
Y como pasa el tiempo que de pronto son años 
Sin pasar tú por mi, detenida 

Te doy una canción 
Si abro una puerta 
Y de las sombras sales tú
Te doy una canción de madrugada 
Cuando mas quiero tu luz
Te doy una canción 
Cuando apareces 
El misterio del amor 
Y si no no apareces 
No me importa 
Yo te doy una canción

Si miro un poco afuera me detengo 
La ciudad se derrumba 
Y yo cantando 
La gente que me odia y que me quiere 
No me va ha perdonar 
Que me distraiga
Creen que lo digo todo 
Que me juego la vida 
Porque no te conocen 
Ni te sienten

Te doy una canción y hago un discurso 
Sobre mi derecho ha hablar
Te doy una canción 
Con mis dos manos 
Con las mismas de matar
Te doy una canción

Y sigo hablando para ti

Silvio Rodríguez,"De tres hermanos el más grande se fue
Por la vereda a descubrir y a fundar
Y para nunca equivocarse o errar
Iba despierto y bien atento
A cuando iba a pisar
De tanto en esta posición caminar

Fui punto en multitud por donde fui nadie me detectó y así aprendí
Cuando creí colmada la tarea volví mi corazón a Casiopea

Cumplí celosamente nuestro plan: por un millón de años esperar
Hoy llevo el doble dando coordenadas pero nadie contesta mi llamada
¿Qué puede haber pasado a mi señal? 
¿Será que me he quedado sin hogar? 

Hoy sobrevivo apenas a mi suerte lejano de mi estrella de mi gente

Y ¿por qué el escaramujo 
Es de la rosa y el mar? 
Yo vivo de preguntar
Saber no puede ser lujo

El agua hirviente en puchero 
Suelta un ánima que sube 
A disolverse en la nube 
Que luego será aguacero

Tan comilón del acervo
Que marchito si le pierdo 
Una contesta a mi pecho
Si saber no es un derecho
Seguro será un izquierdo

Qué fino abono nutrió su raíz 
Dándoles tono silvestre 
Dónde estará su matriz

Esperando tu vuelta, 
En la que presientes 
Que nada ha cambiado

Recoges tu pelo 
Tan libre en la tarde

Nunca lo vio preso. 
Te sientas y cenas

Se meta en tu lecho 
Mas, qué estás pensando?
Te tapas el pecho. 

Pero necesitas 
Quedar bien con todo 
Todo que no sea 
Bien contigo misma.

Me veo claramente 
En la mano una noche lugar de aprenderme 
Con miedo y paciencia 
Lo que era el amor

Un planeta tras otro 
Bañado en sudor

Me veo semi alzado 
En la luz de esa hora, riéndole al techo
Riéndole a ella, riéndome a mi

Tan digno de amantes y breves países 
De felicidad

Y yendo a otras guerras 
Privadas también

A los ruidos internos, feliz tristemente

Recorre el universo en su asteroide
Sin órbita, ni puerto, ni partida
Tapa la soledad con todo el frio
De su vida

Un día llegó un pájaro a su isla
Dentro de un pomo que cabía en su mano
Daba tristeza verlo allí encogido
Cantándole al silencio sin respuesta
Sin sentido

El vagabundo nunca oyó a su pájaro
Y lo veía cantar tras los cristales
Hasta que un dia pudo más su sueño
Y lo libró de la escafandra blanca 
De animales

El pájaro flotó hasta congelarse
Como las lá, grimas del vagabundo 
Entonces metió al pájaro en la jaula
Y lo soltó a la suerte con que vino
Sin comprender jamás

Cómo hay quien malversa la vida 
Cómo hay quien invoca una herida 
Como pueden gastar el amor
Yo no sé 
Como si no faltaran cadenas
Como si nos sobraran las cenas 
Como si diera dicha el dolor
Yo no sé 

Si el mal tiempo trae mala fe
Si la desesperación hace blanco 
Y se cierran los laicos colegios
Si se vuelve al sortilegio 
Y aprendices de delfín 
Creen llegar a merlín
Yo no sé 

Si el mal tiempo trae mala fe
Pero a mí lo que me embruja es volar 
Y hechizarme con tus sortilegios
Soy brillante en tu colegio
Subo nota en el amor
Vuelo allí 
Como al sol 
Un colibrí

Abracadabra
Curandera mi palabra
Todo mal pone bien
Sana del odio y vacuna también

Silvio Rodríguez,"La guitarra del joven soldado 
Es pecosa y discreta. 
Es tan tímida que sólo canta 
Pasadas las diez. 

Cuando tocan silencio ella espera una hora 
Y se escurre de puntas, los pies, 
Y en el monte, debajo de un árbol, 
Suelta al viento su amor y su fe. 
Es recluta también 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Revela secretos, 
Se desata por una mirada 
En arpegio de amor. 

Cada instante le pide tonadas y sones, 
Canciones que nunca escuchó, 
Y buscándolas siempre amanece 
Procurando un acorde mejor. 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Hoy tampoco durmió. 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Es la celosa amante que lo ha de seguir 
En la dicha y también en el llanto, 
Pero siempre ayudando a vivir. 

La guitarra del joven soldado 
Es su mejor fusil; 
Es su mejor fusil, 
Es su mejor fusil.",La Guitarra del Joven Soldado,1996
Silvio Rodríguez,"De quererte cantar sufro disnea 
Bastante más allá de los pulmones
Tu sombra brilla hoy en la pelea 
Mayor de la conciencia y las razones
Por ti canto de pecho
Como el sueño en que giro 
Y leve, como aún respiro
Por ti adelanto trecho 
A lo que falta en tono 
Y canto lo que no perdono

Hombre, hombre y amigo
Aún queda para estar contigo
Hombre, hombre sin templo 
Desciende a mi ciudad tu ejemplo

Supiste cabalgar contra quien odia 
Desde su torre de odio y exterminio
Pero, en mi parecer, te dio más gloria 
El alma que tallaste a tu dominio
La medicina escasa
La más insuficiente 
Es la de remediar la mente
Y la locura pasa 
Risueña cuando engaña
Cual odio de la propia entraña

Hombre sin apellido
Un poco de piedad te pido
Hombre, ay, todavía
Que un tanto más allá está el día
De la melena inculta a la calvicie
Del número inicial a lo incontable
Desde la tumba hasta la superficie
Tras breve veinte tan multiplicable 
Me llega un canto alado 
De fiebres de la infancia
Me brota la invención del ansia 
Y entero y mutilado
Furiosamente a besos
Te doy mi corazón travieso

Hombre, hombre sin muerte
La noche respiró tu suerte
Hombre de buen destino
Y hay luces puestas en camino",Hombre,1996
Silvio Rodríguez,"Soy ciudadano del amor
Llevo dogal de belleza
Entre la hombrera y la cabeza
Entre rodilla y cinturón

Haciendo crítica social
Me perfumé de valiente
Creyeron que era disidente
Y no era más que natural

Martí me habló de la amistad
Y creo en él cada día
Aunque la cruda economía
Ha dado luz a otra verdad

El mundo tiene la razón
Puesta en el pan, en el diario
Ese señor rudimentario
Que nos dará la absolución

Ciega
La vida nueva es
Como un verso al revés
Como un amor por descifrar
Como un dios en edad de jugar
Trino
Vete al destino, al punto que será final
Juega a lo que no jugué
Y canta que aunque sin rey mago
Sigo en pie

Seguro estoy requete mal
Debo sufrir algo extraño
Pues ni la hiel ni el desengaño
Me dan canción de funeral

El fin de siglo trae la sien
Cebada de podredumbre
Como invitándome a una lumbre
Que prenderá quien ame bien

Bendito el tiempo que me dio
Una canción sin permiso
Bendito sea el paraíso
Algo infernal que me parió

El día del armagedón
No quiero estar tras la puerta
Sino soñando bien alerta
Donde esté a salvo de perdón",Juego Que Me Regaló un 6 de Enero,1996
Silvio Rodríguez,"Favor, no se molesten
Que pronto me estoy yendo
No vine a perturbarles 
Y menos a ofenderlos
Vi luz en las ventanas 
Y oí voces cantando 
Y, sin querer, ya estaba tocando
Yo también me alegraba 
Entre amigos y cuerdas
Con licores y damas
Mas ¿de eso quien se acuerda? 
Una vez fui famoso
Siempre andaba viajando
Aquí traigo una foto
Actuando

Me recordaron tiempos 
De sueños e ilusiones
Perdonen a este viejo
Perdonen

Ya casi me olvidaba 
Pero, para mañana
Van a dar buen pescado
Hoy nos llegaron papas 
Y verduras en latas 
Al puesto del mercado
En cuanto llegue y coma 
Me voy para la zona
Por lo de la basura
Como la noche avanza 
Los dejo con la danza
El canto y la cultura

Disculpen la molestia
Ya me llevo mi boca
A mi edad la cabeza 
A veces se trastoca
En la alegría de ustedes 
Distinguí mis promesas 
Y todo me parece 
Que empieza
Favor, no se molesten
Que casi me estoy yendo
No quise perturbarles 
Y menos ofenderlos
Vi luz en las ventanas 
Y oí voces cantando 
Y, sin querer, ya estaba soñando
Vivo en la vieja casa 
De la bombilla verde
Si por allí pasaran
Recuerden",Monologo,1996
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hoy a mi puerta un pájaro trinó
Pero abrí y una sombra se echó a volar

Hoy recordé a edgardo, aquel señor 
Fumador de ampolas, que era juglar

Hoy haré una página celeste
Trovadicta, trova ardiente
Hoy, cantando solo con la luna
Ya que se hizo puta la fortuna
Hoy me trovaré para alegrarme
Como edgardo, sin alarde

Hoy recordé a edgardo, aquel señor 
Fumador de ampolas, que era juglar

Hoy a mi puerta un pájaro trinó
Pero abrí y una sombra se echó a volar",Trova de Edgardo,1996
Silvio Rodríguez,"Siempre hay quien quisiera ser distinto
Nadie está conforme con lo que le tocó
El de edad quisiera ser un niño 
Y el rapaz se raspa sus pelusas en flor
Los que tienen nada quieren algo
Los que tienen algo quieren todavía más
Para pretender el mundo es largo
Para conformarse se a inventado el jamás

Un señor quisiera ser mujer 
Y una chica quiere ser señor
Hasta dios sueña que es un poder
Y mariana quiere ser canción

La tolerancia es la pasión de los inquisidores
El buen ladrón quisiera no tener que robar
Le deben al silencio la voz los ruiseñores
La eternidad no es más que un truco 
Para continuar

La libertad sólo es visible para quien la labra 
Y en lo prohibido brilla astuta la tentación
Nacer a veces mata y ser feliz desgarra
¿a quién acusaremos cuando triunfe el amor? 

Un señor quisiera ser mujer 
Y una chica quiere ser señor
Hasta dios sueña que es un poder
Y mariana quiere ser canción",Y Mariana,1996
Silvio Rodríguez,"Mi unicornio azul ayer se me perdió
Pastando lo deje y desapareció
Cualquier información bien la voy a pagar
Las flores que dejó
No me han querido hablar

Mi unicornio azul
Ayer se me perdió
No sé si se me fue
No sé si se extravió
Y yo no tengo más
Que un unicornio azul
Si alguien sabe de él
Le ruego información
Cien mil o un millón
Yo pagaré
Mi unicornio azul
Se me ha perdido ayer
Se fue

Mi unicornio y yo
Hicimos amistad
Un poco con amor
Un poco con verdad
Con su cuerno de añil
Pescaba una canción
Saberla compartir
Era su vocación

Mi unicornio azul
Ayer se me perdió
Y puede parecer
Acaso una obsesión
Pero no tengo más
Que un unicornio azul
Y aunque tuviera dos
Yo solo quiero aquel
Cualquier información
La pagaré

Se me ha perdido ayer
Se fue",Unicornio,1997
Silvio Rodríguez,"Una mujer se ha perdido 
Conocer el delirio y el polvo
Se ha perdido esta bella locura
Su breve cintura debajo de mí
Se ha perdido mi forma de amar
Se ha perdido mi huella en su mar

Veo una luz que vacila 
Y promete dejarnos a oscuras
Veo un perro ladrando a la luna
Con otra figura que recuerda a mí
Veo más: veo que no me halló
Veo más: veo que se perdió

La cobardía es asunto 
De los hombres, no de los amantes
Los amores cobardes no llegan a amores
Ni a historias, se quedan allí
Ni el recuerdo los puede salvar
Ni el mejor orador conjugar

Una mujer innombrable 
Huye como una gaviota 
Y yo rápido seco mis botas
Blasfemo una nota y apago el reloj
Qué me tenga cuidado el amor
Que le puedo cantar su canción

Una mujer con sombrero
Como un cuadro del viejo chagall
Corrompiéndose al centro del miedo 
Y yo, que no soy bueno, me puse a llorar
Pero entonces lloraba por mí
Y ahora lloro por verla morir",Óleo de Mujer con Sombrero,1998
Silvio Rodríguez,"Ya te estoy recordando, Rosana,
Aunque no te hayas ido,
El lucero que brilla mañana
Es lo que te he querido.
Ya te estoy recordando, elegida,
Como un reo en la sombra
Resucita el color de la vida,
Lo acaricia why lo nombra.

Ni un centavo te cuesta este beso,
Pues mi alma lo paga.
Sólo espero lo mismo por eso,
Hasta el fin de la saga.
Cuando escriban la vida los buenos,
Al final vencedores,
Se sabrá que no usamos veneno
Como aroma de flores.

Brotará de la sangre ternura,
Inocencia why espejos
Donde irán a correr travesuras
Nuevos niños why viejos.
Servirá de señal cada huella
De las horas felices.
Se sabrá tanto de las estrellas
Como de cicatrices.

why el camino que emprendas, Rosana,
Será mejor a veces,
Porque en otros momentos, cubana,
Tu llorarás con creces.
Ya te vas. Yo no me quedo why no atino
A saber qué ha pasado.
Sólo sé que, por causa o destino,
Ya no estás a mi lado.
",Rosana,1998
Silvio Rodríguez,"Hoy viene a ser como la
Cuarta vez que espero
Desde que se que no vendrás mas nunca
He vuelto a ser aquel cantor del aguacero
Que hizo casi legal su abrazo a tu cintura
Y tu apareces, en mi ventana
Suave y pequeña, con alas blancas
Yo ni te miro, para que duermas
Y no te vayas

Que maneras mas curiosas
De recordar tiene uno
Que maneras mas curiosas
Hoy recuerdo mariposas
Que ayer solo fueron humo
Mariposas, mariposas
Que emergieron de lo oscuro
Bailarinas, silenciosas

Tu tiempo es ahora una mariposa
Navecita blanca, delgada, nerviosa
Siglos atrás inundaron un segundo
Debajo del cielo, encima del mundo
Así eras tu en aquella tarde, divertida
Así eras tu de furibunda compañera
Eras como esos días en que eres la vida
Y todo lo que tocas se hace primavera
Ay mariposa!, tu eres el alma
De los guerreros que aman y cantan
Y eres el nuevo ser, que hoy se asoma
Por mi garganta

Silvio Rodríguez,"Olivia despertó por la mañana 
Como suele hacer la gente 
Mas o menos con el sol 
Era un sábado mas en su ventana 
Era una invitación para la suerte 
Era una semejanza del amor 
Mientras trenzaba hijas y calor 
Con la soledad 
Era soledad, salia el sol 

Olivia en su península poblada 
Por la lentitud del día 
Por el tiempo sin hacer 
Sobre su condicio iba clavada 
Como una diosa de la luna fría 
Que a las estrellas quiere conocer 
Y dio a una piedra errante de comer 
Con su soledad 
Era la soledad y vio llover 

Olivia no sabia que la noche 
Tiene puentes de aguacero 
Para llegar a su umbral 
Olivia no sabia que hay un coche 
Y un precipicio al borde del cohero 
Y oyó decir que un astro hinchaba el mar 
Y salio de su isla a caminar 
Sin la soledad 
Era la soledad, oyó cantar",Olivia,1999
Silvio Rodríguez,"Con polvo del Arauco 
Con piedra del Azteca 
Con sangre del esclavo 
Es la resurrección 
Que enciende mariposas 
Why las arroja al viento, 
Que dá al volcán su toca 
Why al trueno su canción. 
El sol ha sido izado 
Por sus primeros sueños, 
Que aullan despertando 
Por la convocación. 

El polvo con el polvo, 
La piedra con la piedra 
Se juntan como rostros 
Why surge la ciudad. 
La antigua cordillera 
Dibuja el sortilegio 
Why al viento vá, afilando 
Cantando libertad. 
Retornan los guerreros 
Al grito de la tierra. 
De nuevo la leyenda 
Se hare realidad. 

De polvo sin mentiras, 
De piedras con entrañas 
Sabiendo que la vida 
Es dura como es, 
Los muertos no equivocan 
Su cita con el alba: 
Los muertos tienen bocas 
Why corazón why pies. 
Los muertos han llegado 
El tiempo los convoca. 
Los muertos son estrellas 
Que no tienen revés.
",La Resurreccion,2000
Silvio Rodríguez,"Al Rey de las Flores 
Lo conocí por la tarde, hare algún tiempo. 
Me llamo la atención su tono 
De arco iris en la piel 
Why su corona de papel. 

El Rey de las Flores 
Tiene su pueblo en un bosque muy remoto, 
Dos pulgadas detrás del sol. 
Cada inquilino en una flor 
Why en cada piso está el amor. 

El Rey de las Flores tiene lagartos 
Que cantan de salto en salto, 
Tiene batallones de abejas chiquitas 
Why arañas, babosas why aves bonitas. 

El Rey de las Flores trabaja why trabaja, 
Su pueblo también trabaja. 
Derrumba los bosques de hierba, tan altos. 
Navega en los charcos de agua del campo. 

El Rey de las Flores 
Tiene sus fábricas dentro de la tierra. 
Cada obrero hare una flor 
Que en primavera crecerá; 
Si no, una mosca las lloverá. 

Sobre los floridos campos del Rey de las Flores 
Veo a mi hijo why llamándolo hay una voz: 
Quedó partido en dos mitades 
Por una bomba que calló.
",El Rey de las Flores,2002
Silvio Rodríguez,"Viajamos entre la tormenta,
Después de la explosión de Dios.
Cada relámpago nos muestra
Fantasmagóricos de amor.
A cada paso se hunde el lodo,
Salta un reptil, acechan diez.
Cada segundo es como el cobro
De lo que resultamos ser.

A bordo de esta expedición
Va un loco, un albañil,
Un nigromante, un ruiseñor
Why un beso espadachín.
Nos falta un día, un niño, un don
Para sobrevivir.

Primero fuimos los heraldos
Llevando buenas del Señor,
Pero excedimos su mandato
Cargando el peso del dolor.
Hoy somos ángeles caídos
Junto al que fuimos a curar.
Temen que a nuestros propios hijos
Les enseñemos a volar.

A bordo de esta expedición
Va un loco, un albañil,
Un nigromante, un ruiseñor
