Jody Miller,"Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry in other words until I die
Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines

Yours until the poets run out of rhymes in other words until the end of time
I'm gonna stay right here by your side do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in this world can drive me away cause everyday you'll hear me say
Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until two and two is three
Yours until the mountains crumble to the sea
In other words until eternity baby I'm yours

I'm gonna stay right here by your side
Till stars fall from the skies baby I'm yours
Until the rivers all run dry baby I'm yours
I'm yours until I die baby I'm yours",Baby I'm Yours,2000

Jody Miller,"Sometime I wonder why you do these things to me 
Sometime I worry girl that you ain't in love with me 
Sometime I stay out late, yeah I'm having fun 
Yes, I guess you know by now you ain't the only one 
Baby, sweet things that you promised me babe 
Seemed to go up in smoke 
Yeah, vanish like a dream 
I wonder why you do these things to me 
Cause I'm worried 
I just can't seem to find my way, baby 
Ooh, the nights I spent just waiting on the sun 
Just like your burned out cigarette 
You threw away my love 
Why did you do that baby 
I wonder why, why you do these things to me 
I'm worried 
Lord, I'll find out anyway 
Sure going to find myself a girl someday 
Till then I'm worried 
Yeah, I just can't seem to find my way 
Yeah, I'm a hard working man 
When did I ever do you wrong? 
Yeah, I get all my money baby 
Bring it, bring it all home 
Yeah, I'm telling the truth 
Sweet things, sweet things that you promised me 
Well I'm worried, I just can't seem to find my way, baby 
I'm worried about you 
I'm worried about you 
Tell you something now 
Worried 'bout you, child 
Worried 'bout you, woman

Jody Miller,"The school board says ""he can't come to school, no more""
unless he wears his hair like he wore it before.
The PTA and all the mothers, say he ought to look like the others.

Home of the brave, land of the free
why won't you let him be what he wants to be

The kids all laugh at his hair and funny clothes.
And more than once he's gone home with a bloody nose
he's not like them and they can't ignore it. So they all hate him for it.

Home of the brave, land of the free
why won't you let him be what he wants to be

It really burns me up, when they put him down
He's the only one whose saying something in this whole town
Instead of those the trouble they hand him, why don't they try to understand 
him.

Home of the brave, land of the free
why won't you let him be what he wants to be
he never hurt nobody,
why won't you let him be what he wants to be
he just a little bit different.
why won't you let him be what he wants to be
You got to understand him.
why won't you let him be what he wants to be

Jody Miller,"Let's all go down to the river 
There's a man who's walking on the water
Come along with me all 
I want to see this man walking on the water
Well he can raise the dead from the grave 
Change the water and turn it into wine
He can make the lame walk he can make the donkey talk
And open up the eyes of the blind
Oh let's all go down to the river

Jesus is the man at the river 
And he's washing people's sins away
He can save the soul if you give him control 
Be ready for that judgment day
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river
Let's all go down to the river",Let's All Go Down to the River,2000
Jody Miller,"If you think her eyes are brighter look at mine
If you think her lips are softer look at mine
If you think her love is stronger don't you hang around much longer
(Stop awhile take a time and get yourself to my place) and look at mine

If you think her clothes are better look at mine
If she writes you nice love letters look at mine
If you think her heart is willing don't you wait to make that kiilling
(Stop awhile take a time and get yourself to my place) and look at mine
Look at mine look at mine look at mine I've got everything you need all the time

If you think her smile is sunshine look at mine
If you think her looks are so fine look at mine
If you think her future's better just forget the day you've met her

Jody Miller,"Looking out on the morning rain I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have face another day.
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
 
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(What you've done to me')
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside.)
And I just want to be 
(Want to be)
Close to you. 
You make me feel so alive!

You make me feel like a natural, natural woman.

You make me feel like a natural natural woman",Natural Woman,2000
Jody Miller,"Somewhere, a party's goin' on
Someone's there that should go home
But he's the life of the party
So his friends won't let him go, oh no

He's havin' a real good time
Tellin' jokes and drinkin' wine
And if someone's waitin' for him
You'd never know

But at home, she's lookin' out the window
Thinkin' about the good times
She remembers holdin' back the tears
And wishin' he was safe at home

Inside, her two lovin' arms sure do miss him
Two lips that long to kiss him
And once more whisper
""Baby, I love you""

Back at the party, he's all smiles
And his mind is a million miles
From the woman
That keeps on lovin' him more and more

One more dance, a little more wine
He's not too worried about the time
'Cause he knows
She'll be waitin' there at the door

But at home, she's lookin' out the window
Thinkin' about the good times
She remembers holdin' back the tears
And wishin' he was safe at home

Outside, she sees the car lights
She hears the door and knows he's alright
And though he's been a million places
She never looks for lipstick traces

And in her heart, she knows he's wrong
But she's so glad to have him home
And once more, she whispers as a tear falls down
She whispers once more, she whispers, ""I love you""",There's a Party Goin' On,2000
Jody Miller,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow,2000
Jody Miller,"He walks like a man
And he talks like a man
He schemes like a man and whenever he can
He dreams like a man
But it's the little boy
It's the little boy in him I love

He's strong like a man
When he's wrong, he's a man
When he's right he's a man
'Cause he never ran
He'll pride like a man
But it's the little boy
It's the little boy in him I love

They say in every man
You'll find a little boy
And every now and then
When he's happy or blue
That little boy comes shining through

He walks like a man
He talks like a man
He lives like a man and since our love begun
He gives like a man
But it's the little boy
It's the little boy in him I love
(He walks like a man)
But it's the little boy I love

But it's the little boy I love

But it's the little boy

Curtains in the window, snowy white

I heard a mournful sound

   Round each other we will twine

Now I've hurt you and it hurts me 
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other 
Without really meaning to

And we'll sing a true love song
And we'll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

   How dear to my heart how precious the moments
   We stood shaking hands and singing a song

My burden is heavy my way has grown weary
I have traveled a road that is long
And it would warm this old heart my dear brother
If you come and sing me one song

In my home beyond the dark river
Your sweet faces no more I will see
Until we meet where there's no more sad parting
Won't you come and sing for me

can't find the joy

I know I hurt you when I said goodbye 
And I don't know the reason I ever stopped believin 
I never needed anyone but you

Can fix you up

Jody Watley,"Have you ever been stabbed in the back
By someone you thought was really cool
Did they steal your heart or was it money
Or was it lies they told
Strangers just disguised as your friends
Never again ?cause now you know

That friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most
Where are your friend

Friends are hard to find
Friends, yours and mine
I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Smiles they hide behind
Never know what's on their mind
Could be true deception

Friends are hard to find, so be careful
You could find an inch or mile if I pay you
But some ain't that bad, but one might back stab
To get the fake tips of what one might have
Bite the hand that feeds you, leave the people who need you
For those who hold you back and mislead you
To be a needle, don't get lead on unleaded
The wrong direction, a dead end's next then
Heed the detour, life's like a seesaw
The ups and downs, and I'll bet there'll be more
Potholes and obstacles in our path, that's righteous
At times you need a hand to fight this
Way of life, straighten up, take the door to the placid
And don't you act two-faced
?Cause jealousy and envy, and you still act friendly
You could find the end and pretend to be

Friends will let you down

Where are your friends, yeah

I'm talkin' ?bout your friends

Used to me kiss me, tell me you missed me
But now you try to glaze me, play me and diss me
Uh, wide awake, ready to break, so we argue
What happened to the kisses, and, ""Why, how are you?""
Forgot about the times when I rhymed when I bathed you
Dreams was the only little things that I gave you
You still ain't thankful, you're still complainin'
Used to be a quiet storm, but now it's rainin'
Farther than ever, I'm thinkin' whether
If we should be friends, let it end, is it better
To forget or remember, your body's tender
The rhymes that I send her, makes her surrender
The feeling of capture, caught in a rapture
No woman can match ya, so when I'm lookin' at ya
Paint a perfect picture so you can remember me
But you can find the end if you pretend to be

Friends will let you down
Friends won't be around
When you need them most

No river's too wide to make it across
All you have to do is believe when you pray

And then you will see the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
Hold on your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find, you
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

And when it's time to face the storm, 
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm, 
I know we'll survive, we'll survive
And when it seems as if your end this growing year
End is growing near
Don't you dear give up the fight
Oh, no just put trust beyond the skies

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry, cry
I hear your voices when you call me, call me
I am your angel, your angel

And when all hope is gone I'm here, 
When all hope is all gone
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are

Jody Watley,"There's something 'bout the morning sun, a day's begun anew
Reminds me to appreciate the mystery of you
To see a bird soar in the sky I've often wondered why
We take so much for granted, we're too blind to see the view

Sometimes I lose my way
Just existing everyday
Drifting away from where my heart belongs
When my heart belongs to you

And it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify
That it all begins with you

The more of life I live to see, I feel more like a child
The lessons that I have to learn I know will take awhile
And if it takes eternity, I hope your plan's for me
Surround me with the gift of joy and make my days complete

Embrace me with your love
And help me rise above
Show me the way to keep the faith
So I won't forget to say

That it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify
That it all begins with you

Oh, there's love in wind my hope is alive
When I keep my eyes on you
Oh there's peace in my heart 'cause I've got a friend
Who'll forever be the strength to carry me through, carry me through

I know it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify
You're the reason why, and it all, all begins with you",It All Begins With You,1991

We're forced to look, yo baby you off the hook
Checking your measurements, it's precious and delicate
Highly intelligent, it's elegant elements

I put the magic wand on her, and drop the bomb on her
Tender touches, now I lust for lady lucious

That never belonged within your plans

And why do I keep falling for

Then they say ""goodbye""

Because I'm right here

I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I'll give the world to make you mine

Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain we can do it all night
Out to tour the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot

But I got the master key

Life is funny ain't it (yeah)
Sometimes you can end up with
Somebody you really don't wanna be with
And others left to figure it out
Check it

She was more than a women, a goddess for all it seems
All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the groovin' love was on
But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone

In a tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
(Secret memories in her mind)
Secret memories in her mind
How could love be so unkind?
Heartbreak time (my heart is breaking)

Just faded pictures in a broken glass (broken glass)
Like a mirror revealing (I see, I see you)
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past? (Way back long ago)
'Cause it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass (Joe help me out!)

As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face
I could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way
Then she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends
To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose

In a tattered picture book (tattered picture book)
Was a photograph she took (she took, yeah) years ago

Just keep spinning 
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
'Cause she's lost inside the past

I don't now what I would do without it
I only know I live and breath for your love

You dried my tears, you cared for me

Coppin a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearing PJ's

I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown (hoe) wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down pro-fessional, I'm gonna let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere

Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make a chick (come)

Joe,"I never believed in dreaming, it never got me very far.
I never believed that love could find me, like an arrow through the heart.
I never believed in miracles, or building castles in the air.
Not until that day I found you, turned around and you were there.
From the day you came, you gave me, a whole new point of view.
I've been touched by an angel, it's impossible, but true.

I believe in you.
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
I believe in you.
And I believe our love will last always.

I never believed in fairy tales, tho sometimes I wish I could,
I never believed that golden slippers could ever find the perfect foot.
I never believed in magic, or that wishes could come true,
But your very first kiss changed all this, something only you could do.
You made me a believer, you made me trust again,
You showed there's a pot of gold, at every rainbow's end.

I believe in you.
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
I believe in you.
And I believe our love will last always.

Only love, sets you free,
And if you serve to fate, then you're my destiny.
Now I know, now I see.
Anything can happen, if you just believe.

I believe in you.
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.
I believe in you.
And I believe our love will last always.

I believe in you.
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place.

Joe,"Hm, hm, hm, hm
Something ain't right, hm, hm-uh
Something just ain't right
Lord have mercy babe
Listen here
Tell me when was the last time
You brought her roses home from work
Tell me when was the last time
You rubbed her feet when she said they hurt, hm
Tell me when was the last time
You bought a card to tell her how you feel
Don't even know when was the last time
You lit a candle for a late night meal
Tell me

[Chorus]
How long will it be 
Before you treat her like your queen?
And how long will it take 
Before she starts coming home too late?
And how long will it be 
Before she starts running in the streets?
You better take the time to treat her like your lady

You probably don't know when was the last time
You stopped to open her car door
And tell me when was the last time
You heard say baby do it once more
Tell me when was the last time
You didn't have an argument
Don't even know when was the last time
You told the truth about where you been

Now if this don't apply to you
(If this don't apply to you)
Keep doing what you do
(Keep doing what you do)
But if this shoe fits you well
Take a minute just to ask yourself
(Just sixty seconds now)

[Chorus]

Now see what's old to you
Is just like new to the next man
What you don't do for her
She'll find somebody else who can
If you don't want to lose out 
On the best thing you ever had
You better take it from me
You'll only end up just a lonely man
See I know what I'm talking about

Joe,"I never believed in dreaming, it never got me very far 
I never believed that love could find me, like an arrow through the heart 
I never believed in miracles, or building castles in the air 
Not until that day I found you, turned around and you were there 
From the day you came, you gave me a whole new point of view 
I've been touched by an angel, it's impossible, but true 
I believe in you 
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place 
I believe in you 
And I believe our love will last always 
I never believed in fairy tales, tho sometimes I wish I could 
I never believed that golden slippers could ever find the perfect foot 
I never believed in magic, or that wishes could come true 
But your very kiss changed all this, something only you could do 

You made me a believer, you made me trust again 
You showed there's a pot of gold, at every rainbow's end 
I believe in you 
I swear that forever from today, no one will ever take your place 
I believe in you 
And I believe our love will last always 
Only love, sets you free 
And if you serve to fate, then you're my destiny 
Now I know, now I see 
Anything can happen, if you just believe

Everyday I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that you're everything, even more
If only I could find you?.

Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in june
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you?
I'm the desert without the sand
you're the woman without a man
I'm the ring without a hand
I'm missing you?

Driving round thought I saw you pass me
Rear view mirror playing tricks on me
'cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
But my loneliness got the best of me
'cause my hearts so weak?

Back to back against the wall
Always there to catch me if I would fall

If I was in trouble, when you was in trouble
Never gave a damn if I was wrong or right
Never backed down if we had a fight

Now you've gone away
Always thought that you'd be here to stay
See you on the other side, we will ride again

We would ride like the wind on the stairways of sin
I can't believe all the wrong would turn
Now that you're gone, how can I go on?
You were a rose in a concrete world

No no, no no
No no, no no, no no, no

Ghetto to ghetto, it's the meadow to meadow
Tryin' to survive day to day
Livin' crazy was the only way

You were my strength when I was weak
Young and gifted, you were unique
You were far too good for this world, oh

Now you've gone away
Always thought that you'd be here to stay
See you on the other side, we will ride again

I'm back, no Belve, just bottles of Don
With the same role plays that's about to go on,
Any stagnation, I rise beyond
Get it right, understand ma, ties are strong
From the streets where it all started, back in school
To the dough stacks,and nigga start actin' fool
Who's be the loud type and like to flash the jewels
Hit something nice then broadcast the news,
Facts and weed, this slow track that we
Did it all in the hood, had to leave
Asthmatic, guess I had to breathe
Short nigga wait up, suppose to grab the 'vees
Blasted for few winters, rejuvenated
Return like you remembered, but more swifter
Stronger than your malt liquor,
Money, hoes and clothes, don't let them hoes get cha,

If you lie, that's the only way I let you inside
Drop them or not, probably for the love of the block
See me solo in a photo, hands under my cock
For face, the white clock and tainted shades
Take for fake, got a face that just say for raise
Get in the mix, sittin' up in cinema six,
Multi-complex, go before the end of the flick
It's just me, besides I'm just a G
Wit the O in the front, I know what you want

Wait til the lord they don't hit us,

Bring some cups in the clubs and toast with me,
So small crispy, man I flow sippy

Now I'm choked up (I can hardly eat)

Always heard you talk
Never really listened

And I ran your love in a muck

It hit me like a flash a light
I realize, you are my life
And now, I really love you
Yes I do, yes I do

Like a guilty man turned innocent

Baby, won't you be my wife
Accept this ring tonight

Now, I was a blind man who spent his whole life in the dark
No trees, no bees, no Central Park
And I realize, the love in my eyes
You're the perfect work of art, lady

It hit me like a flash of light
I realize, you are my life

You should have left the first time that he hit you
But instead you just stayed and cried

But you told them to mind their B.I.

You had so much going on in your life
Since that man came along and abused you

Joe,"I remember when we were so inseparable
Our love was so unusual
So young and innocent, I don't know where it went
But it's gone, gone, gone, long gone

I believe
There's another man in your life
It's killing me
'Cause I thought I finally found my Mrs. Right

Perfect yesterday, slowly fade away
Disappear without a trace and I don't know where she's gone
She used to call me only, now, she won't
She used 2 luv me only, now, she don't anymore

Where did I go wrong?
Would have seen the sign if I wasn't filled with self-illusion
I know I should walk away
But my heart just won't obey and it's so, so, so, so strong

'Cause I believe
There's another man in your life
It's killing me
'Cause I thought I finally found my Mrs. Right

Perfect yesterday, slowly fade away
Disappear without a trace and I don't know where she's gone
She used to call me only, now, she won't
She used 2 luv me only, now, she don't anymore

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, why should it be a love casualty?
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, somebody better, come, pray for me
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, why should it be a love casualty?
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, somebody better, come, pray for me

Ooh, I still love her

Said I'll be right back 
Don't trip

Took a walk and in the rain
Dinner by candle-light, every night
She was everyman's delight

Had a dream [Incomprehensible]
Bentley and humor and I fell in love
Instantly the way she put that thing on me

I have kissed the most exotic faces
From London to Honolulu
Made love in the most romantic places
What more can one man do

Livin' in a world of girls
It's like swimming in a sea of pearls
Tastes like caviar, watching shooting stars
She tastes like caviar, but you're shooting stars
Like silk to the touch, diamonds in a ruff

Had a girl who was a beauty queen
Most beautiful one to me
Straight out of a magazine, centerfold
Took a ride on my [Incomprehensible]

Puerto Rican, Dominican, Americana
And beautiful Rio Janeiro
And they all look so good to me, oh

I have kissed the most exotic faces
From London to Honolulu
Made love in the most romantic places
What more can one man do

It's like swimming in a sea of pearls
She tastes like caviar, but you're shooting stars

Like a ride in an air balloon
Through the sky on a night with a silver moon
Like the first time lovers kissed
Like the first time lovers with come true

Like a Saturday sun
Like a rush when you know
You're found that one
It feels so good to me

Whoa oh
Alright now

Sunshine
From the first time that we met
Helpless
You took my heart I must confess
Deep in your eyes
There seemed to be a look that said
Hello, is it me you're searching for

Suddenly my sunshine turn to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
You didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans
And it hurts so bad
Someone tell me

Why are all the good girls, taken everytime
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says Hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
Taken everytime
Taken everytime

Dancing
With your body close to mine
Then you kiss my lips girl
Girl I thought it was a sign
I want you forever
But good intentions never win
I've got that feeling
Tonight I'll be alone again

'Cause my mind is crowded with these lonely thought
And it all has to do with you
Now I have been here and I've been there
Even told my friends I didn't care
'Cause when it all hit me that you would never forgive me

Now, I'm living in a house where love could of been
But dreams only lasted for the moment
But the pain doesn't end, it keeps going and going
Now I found out some things in life just don't work out
Gotta get myself together, 'cause you're gone now
But the pain doesn't end, it keeps going and going

No regret, but I can't get myself confused
So those pictures on the wall have to come down
I'm already in a messed up mood
Now love's been warm and it's been cold
But I never had a heart break live this old
'Cause when it all hit me that you would never forgive me

So Tell me (Love's gone away)
Why nothing ain't right, nothing ain't right
Trying to be strong, but I can't, trying to be strong
Another whole day without you in my life
Trying to go through these days
I really don't think you understand
Why nothing ain't right, nothing ain't right
Trying to be strong, but I can't, trying to be strong
Another whole day without you in my life

The things I've been thinkin' bout give me your ear.
'cause I don't normally do this so bare with me through this.
There are so many things that I
Want to say. but let me start by simply
Saying I thank you. darling just because

I used to love someone that I didn't like we used
To want to break up every other night.
I used to think relationships were a lot of stress.
I used to think that pain was a part of
Happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way,
But I don't want us to become
Another used to be.

I hope what I'm saying don't discourage you in any kind of way
Cause I do believe that you have
The potential to be everything I need.
I hope that you can really understand that I would hate
To be with someone new, and tell them what I'm telling you.

I used to love someone that I didn't like.
We used to want to break up every other night.
I used to think relationships were a lot of stress.
I used to think that pain was a part of
Happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way,
But I don't want us to become
Another used to be.

'cause it would only be another waste of time
And another moment to be erased out of my
Mind. another memory a part of history.
I can't forget 'cause it keeps on haunting me.
Now that your here is evidently clear,
But I don't ever have to have this worry again again, oh

I used to love someone that I didn't like.
We used to want to break up every other night.
I used to think relationships were a lot of stress.
I used to think pain was a part of
Happiness. now all that's changed since you've come my way,

Joe,"Not so long ago, I was not so popular
I couldn't find a girl who was into me
I searched for things to blame, maybe I was strange
But I knew one day it would all change

Now I'm making joints that turn the club up and down
Carousel going round and round
Crazy how they all feel me now
I still remember

I remember them girls that didn't want to talk to me

With a million girls

From London to LA
I own a few cafe's
I ain't trying to boast
But I got that dough
I made a video so you could see the life I live
Gotta casa across from Sammy Sosa's crib
Laying out by the pool
Model chicks running around in the nude

Can we have a one night stand
Every girl wanna take me home
Most these girls I would have never known
I don't have to try
Before you know it hands is on their thighs
Before we get into some kinky shit here's the million dollar question

If he wasn't that rap cat
Would you still do that
If he wasn't Freeway would you still wanna leave with him
Roll with him, got a whole lot of soul with him
Are-O-see got a whole lot of team with him
Can't be with him
No fake hoes with him
Keep the vest closed just in case the 4-4's with him
Now, Joe with him and they making it pop
Silly broad what you think we forgot
Man I remember back in the days
When he had waves
I had corn braids and no chains
Now ya'll smell me
Go in any party that I want rocking a skully
Mutha fuckas is all frilly
Now she running up to me
Screaming I can get her on the news
Say my voice get her in the mood
Just get her to the room
I hit her once and I'll leave
Shit leave

I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla night

All the bitch need is a blunt and a Pelle, if that

[Joe Budden]
Dudes wonder why I'm M.I.A.
It's cause I'm back real quiet on the back of the bike in M-I-A
You can get up out that Hyundai boo
Lookin like she off the runway too
Meet me at the crib you can come straight through
Never shoes or pumps, 
straight boots like she strip at Sue's Rendezvous
But oops ? come cool with it, what you want do with it
Joe ma, remember the name and get used to it

Whoa, whoa-ohhhh, whoa..",Not Your Average Joe,2004
Joe,"Listen

Looking back, reminiscing on
Caught a brother doing bad, and you put me on 
You told me not to be ashamed of what I got
Never mind them hatin' niggas up and down the block, babe 
You held it down and the bills got paid 
She said, ""Go ahead baby, do your singin' thing
And when God blesses us I want a Lexus
With a hide away mansion in the Hamptons""

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven 
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl your like a star I feel so high, 
Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me

Girl if you take that back, there would be no cure
I would sail there forever, like a ship with no shore 
What makes me a man, any fool can see
You're more then a woman to me

Look at us, living luxury 
And I been thinking maybe we should start a family 
A girl for you, and a boy for me 
Matching stones separate guests, would you marry me
And if you'd have me I'd gladly give my life
Today I'd take this vow to make you my wife
Nothing temporary you know its quite contrary
Just you and me for an eternity

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl your like a star I feel so high
Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me

But every time he home, he beatin her and smackin her

You need diamonds from Jacob that's black and blue
Water front property you see the sun risin

So when you around my team there's no need to be nervous
I hit it from the back pull out your tracks

Putting up a false bravado
When I lost you, I lost my winning ticket to lotto
Still
Every time I raise my glass
I try to drink away my past
To the world I might appear to be the life of the party
But they don't see me

Oh, I never thought I'd be the one missing
Oh, I can't take this emptiness
And I can't keep going on like this
And I can't keep pretending that this don't hurt like a mother, babe
I know that it's crazy for me to come over
I had to see you
I know I got to change, girl
I'll do that quick
You need to take me back 'cause the sex was sick

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Oh, baby
Remember when we used to ride the bus
Girl, how we came up
Fine Korean chicks and all that
I'd give it up just to have you back
'Cause money's only paper, girl
And this house don't feel like home when I'm alone
Whenever you see me
Baby, remember

[Chorus]

Y'all don't see
You only see what you see on the TV
This is my reality
You got to get to know me

Every time I raise my glass

Hop in that rover and come over, I got a package for you

I wanna give it to you girl, just the way you like
Make sure you wear that little see through that I like
It's here the moon, candles burning, got the mood right
It's just between me and you, that's what I like

When you here with me, it's like a fantasy
We go far beyond, then you imagined it would be
Just one kiss so intense, makes me crave your body
I can't control it, to late to slow it, I can't wait for you to show it

If you'd only knew, that I've a thing for you and I want it everyday
Gotta keep it to myself 'cause I shouldn't act this way
But you broke me down, I mean, broke me down, I can't think of nothing else
I can't wait no more, so walk through to the door

Baby, where you at? Baby, where you at? 
Baby, where you at? Baby, where you at?
Every word to touch you down; it's playin' in my head
Like a Scarface crime scene, ain't no bringin' it back
Those tears didn't mean much then, but now I know
That you said you don't feel it; the wind starts to get cold
(Only) she's a woman; like a car, I replace it
(Mostly) I wonder if she saw this bullet comin' like this
(Only) words that I can hear in my ear
It's the gesture, you gon' see this soon as you plannin' in the field

(Baby, where you at?) I just recognize I'm livin' life alone
(Baby, where you at?) I just, I just wish you call me; damn, this phone
(Baby, where you at?) That's if I have four weeks
My whole life just flashed before me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how foolish could I be?

Wild as can be 
(Never) never fear bein' humble (humble)
Got in and out to face my fear
May never have a choice again
To be honest with that one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of talking you off that stage

They say you never know what you have until you lose it
You promise your girl somethin', you better do it
You can't tell a women you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love; you gotta prove it
Back then our relationship was the truest
Romance, slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on, I became foolish
Now you're gone, everything ruined
But, girl, this is Papoose
I'm on your favorite track
I know your friend's in your ear, but, baby, come back
And I never let you down, so later for that
I told you I was gon' make it; I'm the savior of rap
And I work hard; you don't gotta cater for Pap
I tie my own doo rag, lay back and relax
You don't even gotta accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it; acknowledge me

Oh! Oh! Baby! If any one event, it was just like me
Oh! Oh! Babe! Treat her like this wasn't last week
Won't you call, babe? (Won't you call?) You know the song, babe

And nobody couldn't become between us

Now, why would I do it, baby, baby?
I don't deny that there is some attraction
But they lie about my reactions
I could never, never hurt you, baby
Never, never, never

'Cause you think that I've been fooling around

Before you start your third degree
You would know exactly how I feel

Don't you let them take away this love that we have, baby
No, baby, no

If I really didn't love you, baby?
Why would I buy you a diamond ring
If I really didn't love you, baby?

Best case I can change a life

You see you ain't really living

To be there for you, to love you all night long
It's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here, and I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do

Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold?
Treat you like you're nothin' when you're worth more than gold
Girl to me you're like a diamond, I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure, I'll give the world to make you mine

I'll put a string a pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain we can do it all night
I'll touch the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch

All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do

I'll do them for you

'Cause we got a lot to look forward to, 1, 2, what ya gonna do?
What good is a diamond? Nobody can see it
I hear he got you on lock down but I got the master key, yeah

I'll light a thousand candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothin' can be sweeter than the sound of makin' love

Had on my new Air Ones
I was gonna pull out the coupe and drop the top
I was gonna ride around and hug the block

I got a few hours, I might as well as stay
Now I'm gonna lay back and watch her drop her top
Now I'm gonna record the s--t rewind and watch
Ooh ooh ooh ooh now after 2 hours of footage
Ooh ooh ooh ooh her body couldn't continue to do it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh she looks at me and says please don't go nowhere

She wants a sugar daddy
She wants me to keep giving her the magic
She loves it cause I can do it all

She got me feeling like a bad wish
Y'all already know what this is

And them knocks look like buttercups

And take you to the third round
And you been waiting all day
Or you just missing me
Don't worry girl I ain't going nowhere

Backing it up and gripping the bed frame

Joe,"Here on this night so silent
I pray to heaven to bring you home
Snowflakes have turned to rain
Rafters defrost on my window pane
Can you hear the children carol?
Singing songs of joy but not for me
Pierced through my heart like an arrow
Holiday pictures of you and me
Come to the tree
We can light this night together
Just you and me
The way it used to be
It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you, without you
So hard to, if I had a thing to say
It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you, I pray
Pray that you'll be the gift the angels bring
Guilt follows me like a shadow
If given the future, the past I'd change
Your gentle touch, it stays with me
The love you gave was so unique
The way you care, the love we share
Even now I can see you standing there
I see the ghost of Christmas all around
Your smiling face, I like this happy sound
Oh girl, come to the tree
We can light this night together
Just you and me
The way it used to be

It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you, without you
So hard to, if I had a thing to say
It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you, oh, baby
Pray that you'd be the gift the angels bring
No mistletoe, no midnight low, so crazy
Living here without you in my life
No eggnog toast, no cuddles close by the fire
Without you I always spill a tear
No sharing gifts, no snow bound trips, so crazy
Living here without you in my life
No reason to shop, no end, no top by the fire
Without you I always spill a tear
Just you and me
The way it used to be
It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you
So hard to, if I had a thing to say
It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you
I don't wanna be home without you
Pray that you'd be the gift the angels bring
I pray, I pray, I pray
If I'm sitting home, yeah, yeah
It ain't Christmas
If I sit at home without you
Pray that you'd be the gift the angels bring",It Ain't Christmas,2010
Joe,"Baby baby since you've been away
The skies are gray, my world is fading
I see love is walkin' 'round my way
The holiday, the celebrating
With everyone with smiles upon their face
Anticipating
But the stars are not for me cause deep inside my heart is aching
When your out there on the road
I'm missing you, I can't hold on (I can't hold on)
And on this special day

[Chorus]
Baby come home, baby come home
This Christmas night, (this Christmas night) don't leave me home alone
Don't leave me alone, baby come home (callin' on you)
It's just not right, for you to leave me alone
Make sure you're home

Colored lights and Christmas ornaments
Through frosted windows, candles glow (Oh wee)
Love is sharin' with all the Christmas joy
I stuffed your ice out in the snow
There's a fire burning bright
But you're not here to hold me tight
On my knees I hope the angels ?????
When your out there on the road
I'm missing you, I can't hold on (Oh lady)
And on this special day
But your working

[Chorus]

I got a present waiting for you here when you get home (Yeah)
I can't wait to see you wrapped up in my arms baby
All I want this year is that you get one precious gift
Share this special night, special night
Share this special night

A day for so much fun
I had my white T on
Had on my new Air Ones
I was gonna pull out the coupe and drop the top
I was gonna ride around and hug the block
Then she called and said I'm on my way
I got a few hours, I might as well as stay
Now I'm gonna lay back and watch her drop her top
Now I'm gonna record the s--t rewind and watch
Ooh ooh ooh ooh now after 2 hours of footage
Ooh ooh ooh ooh her body couldn't continue to do it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh she looks at me and says please don't go nowhere
Give me a second to breathe

And take you to the third round

And you said you were through

You put your finger on my lips, and whispered to me
Please don't say a word, just take it

Didn't plan on this morning after

It's like girl we put it down in this bed

Would you love me and leave me girl you planned it so devious
Thought you were bringing your love back instead it's ""dear Joe, baby I'm gone""
Now all I got left here of you is your lipstick as the signature, sincerely yours

We shook the world for hours, now it's dead silence, oh
Don't take your love away you know it belongs right here

As the sun shines in on your side of the bed
I stare at that empty space where you lay
Cause I kissed you beneath your waist, body and lip, tightened your grip
You said you thought that you were ready to come back to me
And after all that good loving, my question is baby why can't we

Girl I've taken care of you, so far so good.
And you never have to worry, just stay with me.

Whether in the mansion or in the hood.
This is how we vow to remain.
Now the times are harder than they've ever been
So close to throwing the towel in.
I need you to appreciate what I'm doing for you.

What is trying when I've giving you my heart
Nothing left at all, what do you want?
What is winning when I've given you my soul?
My heart of gold, it's yours to own.
You want me to do, do the impossible, do the impossible.
Girl I've done everything to be just a man,
I can't do the impossible, do the impossible.
I know I tell you that I am,
But I'm not Superman.

Not to contradict myself that I can provide,
But the fight is tough, when your opponent is time.
Baby when you looking foul now?
The struggle we will prevail now,
But sometimes we need to just wait it out.
But I need you not to doubt me, not no more,
Just stay calm and look cute and show some poise.
And baby if we happen to strike out, there's always another around.

What is trying when I've giving you my heart

Can a person really go to God himself,
To ask him to grant your wish.
Either way you lose, cause I may not come back with it.
Hope you see that I'm willing to give my life for you,
Girl I shouldn't have to.
But I really wanna meet your demands.

Money real good but money bringing me more problems
Go and do things, be my Mary Jane
Made a touch in your light, I take it away
Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment
Roll you up, light you up
Show you how I own it

Come a little closer, girl I wanna tell ya
Clothes off your body baby
I wanna get high off your love tonight
I want to play the naughty, can you play the last night?
Do it over naughty, be that T and thug life
Just let it rotate
To my lead, everywhere I come so

Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment
Roll you up, light you up
Show you how I own it

I'm gon measure up
Nothing beats this feeling I know
Except the greatest love
One for now and one for the road
Til I come touch er up
When this gonna end I don't know
But now I'm in love with my slow

I only met er once, a little marijuana
Money real good but money bringing me more problems
Go and do things, be my Mary Jane
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment
Roll you up, light you up
Show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane
My my my my Mary Jane

Light it up, pass it around
Burn it up baby, then blow it up",Mary Jane,2013

I gotta find me a girl
Whoa oh
Alright now

Sunshine
From the first time that we met
Helpless
You took my heart I must confess
Deep in your eyes
There seemed to be a look that said
Hello, is it me you're searching for

Suddenly my sunshine turn to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
Your eyes didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans
And it hurts so bad
Someone tell me

Why are all the good girls, taken every time
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Every time I says ""hello""
Then they say ""goodbye""
So why are all you good girls
Taken every time (Taken every time)

Dancing
With your body close to mine
Then you kiss my lips girl
Girl I thought it was a sign
I want you forever
But good intentions never win
I've got that feeling
Tonight I'll be alone again

Suddenly my sunshine turned to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
Your eyes didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans

Baby, where you at? Baby, where you at?
Every word to touch you down; it's playin' in my head
Like a Scarface crime scene, ain't no bringin' it back
Those tears didn't mean much then, but now I know
That you said you don't feel it; the wind starts to get cold
(Only) she's a woman; like a car, I replace it
(Mostly) I wonder if she saw this bullet comin' like this
(Only) words that I can hear in my ear
It's the gesture, you gon' see this soon as you plannin' in the field

(Baby, where you at?) I just recognize I'm livin' life alone
(Baby, where you at?) I just, I just wish you call me; damn, this phone
(Baby, where you at?) That's if I have four weeks
My whole life just flashed before me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how foolish could I be?

Wild as can be 
(Never) never fear bein' humble (humble)
Got in and out to face my fear
May never have a choice again
To be honest with that one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of talking you off that stage
(Only) she's a woman; like a car, I replace it

[Chorus]

They say you never know what you have until you lose it
You promise your girl somethin', you better do it
You can't tell a women you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love; you gotta prove it
Back then our relationship was the truest
Romance, slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on, I became foolish
Now you're gone, everything ruined
But, girl, this is Papoose
I'm on your favorite track
I know your friend's in your ear, but, baby, come back
And I never let you down, so later for that
I told you I was gon' make it; I'm the savior of rap
And I work hard; you don't gotta cater for Pap
I tie my own doo rag, lay back and relax
You don't even gotta accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it; acknowledge me

Oh! Oh! Baby! If any one event, it was just like me
Oh! Oh! Babe! Treat her like this wasn't last week
Won't you call, babe? (Won't you call?) You know the song, babe

But I don't remember what was said
In this dream of black and white
We were talkin' all through the night

About life and of love
And I don't want to lose it
Oh, was it real?
Or was it really just a dream?

Have you seen it all before
Pictures passing, patterns fading off?
Does your life look like painted glass
Is it hard to see through anything [Incomprehensible]

Is this life and this love
Just an illusion
Or is it real?
Or is it really just a dream?

You can dream with your mind
You can dream with your head
When the dream is unspoken
Then the dream's never said

You can dream with your eyes
You can dream with your soul
Oh, I've been dreaming, oh, I've been dreaming
Man, I've been dreaming
But I just don't know

Dream, I can't explain
'Cause when I awoke
It faded again

So is this life and this love
Just and illusion?
Or is it real?
Or is it really just a dream?

Change your face under the desk, your pencil
Just a booth away you trace and stencil
When the pilot light is on the lights they flicker out and on

No you're never coming down
No, you're never coming down

Pack the bag before your leave
Iron out the torn up sleeve
And run away from everything

Open window pulled down shade
Torn up sheet the bed you made
Anything I could have said
To make you stop and think again

Joe Arroyo,"Me acostumbraste a vivir a tu modo
Yo que nunca fui un ser conforme
Me enseñaste a mi una clase de amor
Con tu experiencia especial
Lo comento para que entiendas hoy
Que yo nunca te he olvidado
Tolere toda tu obsesión
Tus depresiones y mal humor.

Al final yace un maniático amor
Otro títere que controles
Te olvidaste del fantástico amor
Que yo te solía brindar
Lo comento para que entiendas hoy
Que yo nunca te he olvidado
Yo que fui de tu demencia
Tus desvanes e indecisión.

Que se ve,
De tú, a mi modo
Caprichosa, pechichona, tan linda haciendo el amor

Que se ve,
De tú, a mi modo
En punto, obsesión, con pasión yo la medí

Que se ve,
De tú, a mi modo
Y es que está buenísima

Uno tal para cual
Calla boca de clavel
Uno tal para cual
Quiero tenerte otra vez
Uno tal para cual
La vil cubana llamó otra vez
Uno tal para cual

Me duele ver que en ti crecen ilusiones
Y mientras tanto yo no quiero hacerte daño

Pero por ti descubri­ que la vida es bella y saldré adelante 
Por ella es que late fuerte mi corazón 
Pero contigo seguro que podre querer y amar de nuevo

Voy a vencer el miedo yo voy a adorarte

Joe Arroyo,"Hay noches de arreboles
Que incitan al amor
Y en los alrededores
Se enciende el ardor
Son noches de ilusiones que
Como hoy te llaman
Y te dicen mi cielo
Cada día, te quiero más

Hay noches de arreboles que
Te incitan vida mía
Temblando de emociones
Me das tu pasión
Son noches de arreboles que
Como hoy, cual flama
Encienden corazones
Ansiosos, al amor

(Si) Noche de arreboles como la de hoy
Te incitan y te entregan al placer del amor

Son noches de emociones
Son noches de pasiones
Son noches de rubores
Llenas de desilusiones de amor

Noche de arreboles como la de hoy (Si, como la de hoy)
Te incitan y te entregan al placer del amor

Son noches de temores
Pero que noches de dolores
Son noches que me llaman
Que me empujan
Que me impulsan
Y me dicen que
Que me entregue a la pasión

Ahora que te he conocido
Oye bien lo que te digo
Donde vayas yo te sigo mujer
Pues mi amor llevas contigo

Noche de arreboles como la de hoy (Noche de arrebol)
Te incitan y te entregan al placer del amor

Son noches de temores
Pero que noches de ilusiones
Son noches de ilusiones que me llaman
Que me empujan
Y me impulsan que
Que me dicen que
Que me entregue a la pasión

Noche de arreboles como la de hoy (Si, como la de hoy)
Te incitan y te entregan al placer del amor

Oye mama no me llores
Mira que te traigo flores
Oye olvida los temores
Que que imaginaciones
Ardientes corazones

Ilusión, que va

Noche de arreboles como la de hoy
Te incitan y te entregan al placer del amor

Tu cu tu cu pa
Tu cu tu cu pa
Tu pa ca tu pa ca
Tu pa can bo

Así me suena el corazón de amor
Cuando siento las pasiones

Se acabó",Noche de Arreboles,1999
Joe Arroyo,"Sufro mucho al saber que no te has muerto
Y al mirar aquel retrato (no te has muerto)
En tu rostro yo comprendo
La maldad de tu querer
Falsedad en tu mirar (no te has muerto)
Amor sólo para perder
Así es, vida, tu querer

Por eso te digo:

Sabré olvidar, mujer
Y yo, sabré olvidar
Oh no no no no no nooo
Sabré olvidar, mujer
Y yo, sabré olvidar

Si tu quieres te perdono
Pero deja de pecar (no te has muerto)
Y como una magdalena
Confiésate, aprende a amar (no te has muerto)
Sólo así te salvaras
Pues yo como un chacal (no te has muerto)
Seguiré por mi camino
Cantando, riendo siempre, y así yo sabré olvidar

Sabré olvidar, mujer
Y yo, sabré olvidar
Oh no no no no no nooo
Sabré olvidar, mujer
Y yo, sabré olvidar... analiza!

Sabré olvidar, mujer
Y yo, sabré olvidar
Oh no no no no no nooo
Sabré olvidar, mujer
Y yo, sabré olvidar... así!

Sabré olvidar, mujer

Oh no no no no no nooo
Sabré olvidar, mujer

Joe Ascione,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1996
Joe Ascione,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Joe Ascione,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows,1998
Joe Ascione,"Pack up your troubles and just get happy

Joe Ascione,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,1999

What a wonderful thing a sunny day
The cool air after a thunderstorm
The fresh breezes banish the heavy air
What a wonderful thing a sunny day

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face

Shining is the glass from your window
A washwoman is singing and bragging
Wringing and hanging laundry and singing
Shining is the glass from your window

But another sun
That's brighter still
It's my own sun 
That's in your face
The sun, my own sun
It's in your face
It's in your face

When night comes and the sun 
Has gone down
I start feeling blue
I'd stay below your window
When night comes and the sun 
Has gone down

Joe Ascione,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings",Volare,1999
Joe Ascione,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again,2000
Joe Ascione,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

I never knew what they could do.

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found my future at last

Joe Augustine,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

I'll learn by easy stages

I'll get up and do a nifty.

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Joe Battaglia,"Tell me lawyer what to do 
I think I'm falling in love with you 
Defend me from the way I feel 
Won't you give me some advice 
On how to handle my private life 
I'm sure we can make a deal 
I confess I'm a fool for men with a clever mind 
But your intellect ain't no match with this heart of mine 

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

Your sense of justice I'll embrace 
But your defense don't help my case 
I'm deep in trouble with the law 
Something about authority 
Seems to bring out the bad in me 
Hey lawyer gotta catch me when I fall 
Oh they say that you match your wits with the best of them 
But I know when I'm close you're just like the rest of them 

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

So put your books aside 
Loosen off the suit and tie 
Gotta open up your heart and let me in 
Open up your heart and let me in",At 94th Street,2007

You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam
With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggaz ramblin on about the paper that they getting stop it
I got more money than you in my little pocket

Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South

To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out

Joe Benjamin,"Hey, baby, how about this dance?
Why?
'Cause it takes two to do this dance

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone

But

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Let's do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love

You can stare at the moon by yourself
Take a laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot, go to pot on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone

But, listen here

Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance

Joe Benjamin,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise

I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001

And she pulls me into her bright golden wing.
Bright golden wing.

West on 80 and it won't take too long, 
'Til the road starts climbing up to mountain time.

The girl I know there, she lives free and easy, 
And she shows me wonders and she takes my mind.

And she's wild as eagles, 
She's as sweet as honeysuckle, 
Her life's flowing like a mountain stream.

And she takes me somewhere, 
And it's good to be there,

I see it shining in the hay.
There's something golden in my hands,
And then I go and let it slip away.

With eyes that are broken, my feelings are spoken.
It's time for the waters to break.
I know where I should be, and I'm gonna make it there.
I won't let you be my mistake.

The days go by like chapters from a book,
I'm skipping pages to the end.
There's a story that I'll never know,
The one about the man who makes amends.

With eyes that are open, my feelings are spoken.
It's time for the waters to break.
I know where I should be, and I'm gonna make it there.
I won't let you be my mistake.

The moment's uncovered, I must seize the day.
This goal that I hold high - won't let it be lost for all time.

I know where I should be, and I'm gonna make it there.

This I see
But I'll remember happier times
Life it hits me
Comes faster now day by day
Places that I've been
Are not the place I wanna be
Never trade you for the world
Never do the things I used to
I guess it's not good enough 
This I see
And I'll remember happier times
Friday comes and goes
I guess I won't talk to you anymore
So many things unsaid
So many things I wanna say
Never trade you for the world
Never do the things I used to
I guess it's not good enough 
This I see
But I'll remember happier times
And Now remember happier times

Board up the windows and head for the trails

If I could freeze time in my own hands

Left my home with the shirt on my back
Built my empire on a dry haystack
To break it down a one by one
And back in Cali and tired and alone

I brought this on by my own hands
The precious disgrace from my own hand
If I could freeze time in my own hands

Traces of life blowing in the sand
The cornerstone of my piece of dry land
So hand me that hop and some of that wine

Joe Bonamassa,"Sinners, Monks and Thieves all share the air we breathe
Smoke, Swords and Fire, bravemans true desire
For free men must fight tonight all in the glory of war
We sit in waiting every mile on Hadrian's Wall
With steel dirt and sand
We all have stake in the land
For many will not see
Morning sun rising, flags on the horizon
Thus begins the battle of Hadrian's Wall
Tonight they will come, 4,000 chariots strong
River of red flowing down, all in the name of Galaman's crown
For many will not see
Morning sun rising

Over the horizon
Lead by arrows
And the release of the dragon
Blood rivers flowing
Man die without knowing
We fight as legions
Against a crown of treason

Never thought I'd live to see another day

Burn down the Sun
How can you be so cold?

Will break this spell
What will become of me?
It took my breath
So hard I fell
Lost in a shell, ghostly
And the rain falls down
On this lonely child
And I could not feel

To grieve

Battle worn
And it's so real
I got to go
I'm on my way
To another land
Where I can stay
I can feel the afterburn
There lies my freedom

They turn
I will discover
