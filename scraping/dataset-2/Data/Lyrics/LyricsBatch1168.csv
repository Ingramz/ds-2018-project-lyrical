The Pilgrims,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,
The Pimps,"Within this dime-a-dozen world
I swear they must've broke the mold
'cause you're the only soul I've met
That I would kill to call my own.
Let it be known, I'm not aggressive, or possessive
All I know is, I would kill to make you mine
& I am usually not this bold
Let it be known....

I never wanted to be anybody's anything....
Anything at all,
I'm rather small, yet all my shortcomings stand tall
I've crawled upon my hands & knees
Out of the fear that I could fall
& through it all it's left me withered,
Feeling bitter bought & sold,
Been told I'm not the nicest person
That you'll ever get to know
Let it be known....

I never wanted to be anybody's anything....
Weaving through this dust
I trust nobody else but us
I must admit It'd take some years
For me to walk without this crutch
So on & such, I'd still be fucked
If I am forced to walk alone
& should I crumble at your feet
I'll hold us both accountable
Let it be known....

I never wanted to be anybody's anything....",Rocket Science,2000

Comin' in on a wing and a prayer

The Pine Hill Haints,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2007
The Pine Valley Cosmonauts,"Walking slow to the graveyard I've lost everything I could lose
Now I've even lost my baby I guess I've got the drunkard's blues
It was down at Big Joe's barroom on the corner beyond the square
Everybody drinkin' good liquor the regular crowd was there
So I strolled out on the sidewalk began to look around
Looking everywhere for my baby but that sweet woman can't be found
It was down at St James infirmary I found my baby there
Stretched out on a long white table so cold so pale so fair
So I strolled back down to the barroom to get another drink of gin
The next thing you know I'm reeling rocking and drunk again
Sixteen coal black horses all hitched up in a line
In that pretty buggy she's ridin' goodbye ol' gal of mine
Walking slow to the graveyard I've lost everything I could lose
Now I've even lost my baby I guess I've got the drunker's blues

The Pine Valley Cosmonauts,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart

The Pine Valley Cosmonauts,"There was a time when I thought of no other and we sang our own love's refrain

But I won't be blue always,

And I tried to put my thoughts in a song

We never talked it out
Now she?s gone so you can knock it out

She caught me runnin round and set me free

And I?m needin her sweet love calls me

When a man is being loved
He takes things for granted
Can?t see himself falling

I did her wrong
And I can?t blame that girl for being gone
Well I was cheating on her all along
And I can?t blame that girl for being gone
I guess I had it comin

The Pine Valley Cosmonauts,"I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, ""Dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleading in my nose
I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me
They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail
I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl
The girl I loved so well

The Pine Valley Cosmonauts,"Poor ellen smith, how was she found
Shot through the heart, lying cold on the ground
Her body was mangled and all cast around
Blood marks the spot where poor ellen was found

They picked up her body and carried it away
Now she's a-sleepin' in some lonesome grave
Who had the heart, and who had the brain
To shoot my little darling on that cold lonesome plain?

They picked up their rifles and hunted us down
They found us a-loafin' all around town
The judge may convict me, and god knows, he can
But I know I'll die as an innocent man

I've been in this prison for seven long years
Each night I see ellen through my bitter tears
I got a letter yesterday, I read it today
The flowers on her grave have all faded away

The warden just told me that soon I'll be free
To go to her grave 'neath that old willow tree
I'm free from the walls of that prison, at last
But I'll never be free from my sins of the past

Saw the shadow slip away from my house
So I hurried straight and looked into her room
And I found out that it was my loving spouse

So I waited in the shadows until morning
And the gun that I held was trembling in my hand
No I did not mean to give them any warning
For the devil on my shoulder had command

And they sentenced me to die right away
But before I leave this courtroom please your honor
There is something more that I would like to say

Yo wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up 
The wisdom we apply Son soak this shit up 
If it was sess Son niggaz would smoke this shit up 
So wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up 

Yo yo yo we are street soldiers of the dark side of the planet 
I kill killing orders like a lieutenant 
Hit the planet Earth then explode like a human cannon 
The universal author, born to kill saga

Brain surgeon is aversions my purgin' mind urban 
Scientists found killed and wrapped up in curtains 
Casualties, flashbacks, now simply that

Professional assassinator professor 
Assassinate your mind state and broke the metal plate 
Lyrical Nostradamus, psychotic mind of Sadaam 
Ex-con, attack the Pentagon 
with unorthodox firearm from Vietnam 
I crucify 'em, like Muslims murdering Jews from Jerusalem 
Now who's the supreme lyricist? You can't seize this 
When I die, my name'll be worshipped like Jesus 
War visual individual incriminate the criminal 
My culture nickel put holes in your face like dimples

Brains get unfrozen when they oppose, as we unfold 
Futuristic scrolls that was prophesied scriptures 
Fitting an untold, I roll with my skull and bones 
Made of solid gold, skin is closing up 
Approach your home, with a war, Armageddon in my home 
Wisdom mind ruler mental intruder 
From the tribe of Judah 
Devils disappear like they went through the 
Bermuda, triangle, erupting on Ryzarector tracks 
like volcanoes, so God swear to me 
I appear two years sample revolution in the burning cup 
Constitution, learned too much, came off must return 
Observe the facts, delivered by, blacks 
Soon as we unite the sky cracked 
A group of UFO's formed a seven in the heavens 
God celebrate devils death day signal 
Jail let loose the criminals, bystanders died 
Waiting for miracles we giving you

Yo, I make your heart thump like tree stumps 
Be crackin' concrete chumps released once 
The Earth shifts, vocal points clips he wrote and missed 
Killer vocalist, load his fist blessed with loaded gifts 
Golden clips, shotty slipped like psychotic hits 
In soldier flicks, who wrote the shit superior 
Mines combine the modus click 
Enterprise like German spies, keep my eyes on Soviets 
Stay Russian my direction I'm wettin' like a leaf bone 
Freak poems, seek thrones, to call home where freaks bone 
To each his own, chrome zones, be cloned like chromosomes 
So the chrome, the golden toned champ whip rollin' bones 
Fire's on, blazin' hot trails at night, barren ville 
Shotty still collaborating on tracks with Bobby Steels 
Generate a mil, Killa Bee law, kill or be killed 
Know the ledge, finally, our justice has revealed 

[Chorus]

The forty third conviction, incarcerated in hell for eternity 
But my mentality and chemistry made me celestial through the galaxy 
Sparks friction, generating through evaporation 
Slay through meditation, your body is now liquidation 
Even your hemoglobin is swollen with corrosion 
Amputated and rated physical zone disintegrated 
That's what niggaz face when fuckin' with the Sunz of Man 
Go to the dungeon I could lead a hundred men, with a golden pen 
Forced to intercept with the click from Shaolin 
Killin' devils, scatter they ashes over the sea of Mediterranean 
That's my trademark, PS burned in my victims heart 
I be the Star from afar illuminating through the dark 
Another burning face of death 
The initiation of the Mason, 186 my name's left in the Book of Revelation 
Reminiscing about the days, raising hell 
Representative of a mind, able to lead a city what technicality of mankind 
Mistake trying to keep me behind the closed doors of reality 
All three eyes to the revolution can now escape the blind state of confusion 
Trials and tribulations of the original nation 
Leaves a headache, the only chance of elevation

But the blisters on my skin they tell me different
Bad dreams-sugarcoated tabs from hell
Drowning in the wishing well I save for you

Something here ain't exactly right
Someone turn the wheel before I drown

Sometimes I see these things
That don't exist

Too far gone to stop, too scared to move

And move through the scars
So careful you are
To surrender a thing

But Jesus ain't comin'
So don't waste your time
Not yours and not mine
You're only dreaming

And while you were scheming
The silver, the sheets
Far above the leaves
I snuck into your scene

Don't lie there looking
Behind your troubled walls
Wicked as they are
You're not deceiving

And if I could find your heart
I would pull it from your chest
And smash you with my fist
Til it was beating

And if there's a hole inside
Heaven in your bed
'Cause the angel that you kissed
Just left you bleeding

I know it ain't easy
To keep roundin' on
When the voices in your skull
Are always screaming

Broke into your prison
And dropped the sleeping guards
Painted flowers on the bars
And snuck you out the yard

So afraid to speak her mind, it's such a shame
Cause what a brilliant mind she has

[Chorus]
And now she's been introduced to confidence
She doesn't see, that she is bordering on arrogance
When will she learn, to come back to the middle

He is, a young black man, grew up without his father
And now it falls into his hands, to protect his mother
Cause if he doesn't, well then who will, his older brother lives in fear
Of everything, especially, trying to fill his father's shoes

Respectively, they go to extremes, of masculine and feminine
Chasing dreams, but they keep on falling
Cause they don't know no balance
When will they learn, to come back to the middle

You must take the good with the bad, and you might hit the wall
Sometimes you'll fly and sometimes you'll fall
There isn't any way, to avoid the pain
But it's getting burned, that's how you will learn
To come back to the middle

Needing to protect your self now that is just a part of life
If you let your fears keep you from flying, you will never reach your height
To get to the top you must come back to the middle
When will we learn, to come back to the middle

Come back to the middle, Come back to the middle
Don't make no mind about falling down
Cause it's when you're in that valley
You can see both sides more clearly

But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters 
Hit you so you don't forget us 
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella 
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation 
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby... 

And all this love, is waiting for you 
My baby... Sweet Darling... 
And all this love is waiting for you 

Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down 
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around 

Ran into your boy, had heard he'd spread the word 
That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese, 
And pissing me the fuck off. 
The first thought of committing a felony never left 
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L, 
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I 
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers 
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you 
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun 
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne 
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home 
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness 
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation 
If I'm incarcerated 
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous 
Who tell us the opposite of that, 
Forever you and Brat 
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame 
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame... 

And all this love, is waiting for you 
My baby... Sweet Darling... 
And all this love is waiting for you 

Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down 
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around 

And all this love, is waiting for you 
My baby... Sweet Darling... 
And all this love is waiting for you

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

The Pioneer Creek Gang,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way",Bitch,1999

The Pipettes,"I knew a girl and her name was Judy
She used to do things I thought were rude
But I never said anything to her face
'Cause my friends thought she'd kick my arse all over the place

Used to think she was kinda cool
(Kind of cool)
Saw her walking all around the school
(Around the school)
All the older boys would stop and turn their heads
All the older girls wished that she was dead

Judy, what you gonna do
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you

Now me and Judy we're the best of pals
(Best of pals)
She took me dancing to the early hours
(The early hours)
And she showed me things I've never seen
Mum always asked me where I'd been when I'm with

Judy, what you gonna do
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you

When you go home at night
Are you still looking for a fight?
You know you're mum is not that mean?
But still you want to rip out her spleen

Judy, what you gonna do
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you

What's in your head?

At four in the morning, not a stitch to wear
'Cause you ignored my warning
You thought it was special, you thought I was wrong

I don't love you, I don't want you
If you think that this is cruel
Then you should see what my friends do
I don't love you, I don't want you
Leave me alone, you're just a one night stand

I saw you across a crowded room
You smiled at me and made my heart go boom

Baby did it hurt when you fell from heaven?

We could talk about lies
He said we could talk about rumours
We could do whatever I like

Why not try something new? Because there's no need for any talking in what we're about to do

Rest, your pretty head, you pretty head
(Just rest, just rest, just rest your pretty head)
Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty head

You know I'm all for conversation, I'm really quite romantic you know,
Why not get right to the point, its not that often we are left alone
No offense, when you get going you really can be quite a bore, now don't take this the wrong
Way, but my heels are getting sore

Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty head

We spent a winter and a spring, just listening not talking, come weather, rain or shine,
No-one ever told you then, but conversations in my head helped me to pass the time

And how are you upon this bright
And sunny morning
I hear your brother Ted
Got caught for speeding
But was let off with a warning
I hope he's learnt his lesson
And the next time he goes out will drive with care
It doesn't pay to drive too fast
All it does is make your life last shorter

I know you won't believe this
But it happens to be true
I am a loner
My only real companion is dog I'm very fond of
His name's Homer
He follows me wherever I go
And of course I do my best to feed him
It's not the easiest of tasks
When you consider unlike cats
They're broader

Do what you want to within reason
But remember take your time
Nothing stops for those
Who can't afford to wait
The best advice that I can give you
Is to hold on to your head
And as long as you are good and kind
You'll always be a friend of mine
And it's true to say that a good friend is hard to find
But I'd like to think that you are
A friend of mine
 
Good morning Sarah Jane
And how are you today
Tell me is that your mother
She looks a lot like you
Though come to think of it
You look like one another
It's funny how with likenesses
Most people have a difference of opinion
They said that I was like my dad
Now they say that I'm just like his daughter
 
Do what you want to within reason
But remember take your time
Nothing stops for those
Who can't afford to wait
The best advice that I can give you
Is to hold on to your head
And as long as you are good and kind

Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops

The kind of September 
When life was slow and oh so mellow 
Try to remember 
And if you remember 
Then follow 
Why does it always seem the past is better 
We look back and think 
The winters were warmer 
The grass was greener 
The skies were bluer 
The smiles were brighter 
Can it be that it was all so simple then 
Or has time rewritten every line 
And if we had the chance to do it all again 
Tell me 
Would we? 
Could we? 

Memories like the corners of my mind 
Memories 
Misty watercolor memories 
Of the way we were 
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind 
Smiles we gave to one another 
For the way we were 

Oh can it be that it was all so simple then 
Or has time rewritten every line 
And if we had the chance to do it all again 
Tell me 
Would we? 
Could we?

What's too painful to remember

I'll tell you my story so you'll understand
What it means to be broke, dropped, and fired in one day
To wake up in the morning with the feeling that it doesn't matter anyway
Once upon a time things were going my way
Nothing ever happened that could bring me down
Thinking that the good times were always gonna stay
But it's been a long time since I've seen a sunny day
Living in the burb's, waiting for the repo man
To take away my car due to insufficiant funds
I got nowhere to go, and my wife just ran away,
With my lawyer and my credit cards, but that's ok,
They never worked anyway
Growing up I listened to my parents as they said:
'Go to school get a job, and then you've got it made'
Maybe that formula worked back in their day,
But I can tell you brother that a lot of things have changed
Looking through the window on to the driveway,
Watching for the repo man 24 hours a day,
Stepping outside, I raise my .45
Giving up the future for today
It never worked anyway, I' m wating for the repo man

We can kiss like mothers
We can sleep like brothers
We can walk like lovers,

Softly crawl into my shell and wait it out till everything is well

Life memories silver and goal,
What makes good times so hard to hold
Save it for the right time when we'll start again

Trying to find myself
You can never walk away from where you are
But right here at home, next to you so all alone,
Is no know one that you've ever known

Why save it for the right time
When that's just pretend we can't never have this day again
Love is waiting on the shelf
While I'm too scared to be a friend
Wandering around the world trying to find myself
I turn around one day and there you are...

And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

Down in New Orleans

The only thing a drunkard needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
The only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He'll fill his glasses to the brim
He passes them around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is bumming from town to town

Go tell my baby sister,
Never do what I have done
To shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

It's one foot on the platform
And the other one on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to spend my life

Cradle me where Southern skies
Can watch me with a million eyes
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Cover me with heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song thru the trees
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That fine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

And don't I know I've reached my goal

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees

A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Knows that I have to be

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through

Made long for the strong undergraddie

The Platters,"After one whole quart of brandy,
Like a daisy I'm awake.
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation,
I've done pretty well I think,
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. 

He's a fool and don't I know it,
But a fool can have his charms,
I'm in love and don't I know it,
Like a babe in arms.

Love's the same old sad sensation,
Lately I've not slept a wink,
Since this half pint imitation,
Put me on the blink.

I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I'll sing to him, each spring to him,
And worship the trousers that cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

When he talks, he is seeking,
Words to get,.off his chest.
Horizontally speaking
He's at his very best.

Vexed again, perplexed again,
Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heart's antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

Romance finis.
Your chance finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",1999

Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along

We'll so no man,

And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

The Playmates,"While riding in my Cadillac, what, to my surprise,
A little Nash Rambler was following me, about one-third my size.
The guy must have wanted it to pass me up
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Refrain:
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

I pushed my foot down to the floor to give the guy the shake,
But the little Nash Rambler stayed right behind; he still had on his brake.
He must have thought his car had more guts
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

My car went into passing gear and we took off with dust.
And soon we were doin' ninety, must have left him in the dust.
When I peeked in the mirror of my car,
I couldn't believe my eyes.
The little Nash Rambler was right behind, you'd think that guy could fly.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

Now we're doing a hundred and ten, it certainly was a race.
For a Rambler to pass a Caddy would be a big disgrace.
For the guy who wanted to pass me,
He kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn.

Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
Beep, beep. (Beep, beep.)
His horn went, beep, beep, beep. (Beep! Beep!).

Now we're doing a hundred and twenty, as fast as I could go.
The Rambler pulled alongside of me as if I were going slow.
The fellow rolled down his window and yelled for me to hear,
Hey, buddy, how can I get this car out of second gear?",Beep Beep,1991

And I'd toast all me neighbours both distant and dear
And I'd shoot back great belly-crippling buckets of beer

Wouldn't give you me the price of a half pint of beer 
Wouldn't give you me the price of a cup of good cheer

To write his name upon a shithouse wall
But before I die I'll add my regal scrawl
To show the world I'm left with sweet fuck all

It isn't the mice in the wall
It isn't the wind in the well
But each night they march
Out of that hole in the wall
Passing through on their way
Out of hell

They're the things that you see
When you wake up and scream
The cold things that follow you
Down the boreen
They live in the small ring of trees on the hill
Up at the top of the field

And they dance on the rain
And they dance on the wind
They tap on the window
When no-one is in
And if ever you see them

Pretend that you're dead
Or they'll bite off your head
They'll rip out your liver
And dance on your neck
They dance on your head
They dance on your chest
They give you the cramp
And the cholic for jest

They're the things that you see
When you wake up and scream
The cold things that follow you
Down the boreen

They sing on the rain
They dance on your eyes
They dance in your brain

Remember this place
It is damp and it's cold
The best place on earth
But it's dark and it's old
So lie near the wall
And cover your head

I had a couple of drinks in town
A few more at the port
I puked up on the gangway

They helped me to a table
Poured whiskey down my throat
They sat me at a table
And I lost my watch and coat

Then we drank some gin
Then we drank tequila
I think that's what did me in
Then we drank some brandy
And the women had a dance

That we could play the game of ""chance""

We crowded round the table
With our money in our hands
I ended up on the other side
Without a penny in my pants
I woke up in the toilet
When we got to Holyhead
The doors were all a-banging
And I wished that I was dead

We got on board the train
And then we had a drink or two
Started playing poker
But the booze ran out at Crewe
Some people started sleeping
Others looked for duty free
Some bastard started singing

He then sang ""Paper Roses""
""Boolavogue"" ""Eileen Aru""

Then I found some gin
I sat down in the corner

For a day on the rant with some music and more
They'd drink porter in Maura's way over in fore
And they never get drunk but stay sober

There was Harry the banjo and Dunne of the swan
With whose bone from the wing he'd beat the bodhran
And the song that he'd sing was of ganders and all
And they never get drunk but stay sober

There was woods on the guitar and auld squeeze box too
Who came from a time before aeroplanes flew
He'd sit in a corner and mule quite a few
And they never get drunk but stay sober

There was Mahon the singer who knew all the songs
And never was known to put a foot wrong
He'd sing through the night till the break o' the morn
And he'd never get drunk but stay sober

A bottomless pit if ever there was one
More porter he'd lower that there was in the land

Where scars of old dry rivers run
Night unfolds, a coal black shroud
Across the hard and stony ground

To the thunder of the Lorca train

Flaming steal swift as wind
Wires hum the rails ring
Smokestack burning fiery sparks

Towns asleep by empty roads
Churches rise from crooked roofs
Cloaked in darkness nothing stirs
Grow smaller darker disappear

A million stars that shed no warmth
Your nightmares all come out to play
In the silver light
Wait for sunrise in the east
Long shadows crawl across the plain
The ghosts of night will disappear
And lay your fears to rest

Steam hissed up, the hot coals glowed
The furnace blazed, the wheels they rolled
On tracks of iron, straight and cold
The silver moonlight danced

Orange in the engines glow
Gleaming pistons whirling cranks

Across the blood red plain
And every step and every breath
Brings me nearer home

They whisper in the wind
And when the dawn lights up the sky
I'll see my land again

A hot wind blows the scrub and dust
Across the barren land
Well, the trees stand bare like skeletons
And the mountain's all torn down

No birds are singing now
And faraway a city stands

When I was older, I drank in bars
When I was young, well, I chewed the leaves
When I was older, I drank with thieves

I found a love, she gave me dreams
She left me drunk in New Orleans
So cold and lonely, so all alone
I wished my heart was made of stone

I took the cold bright needle
I used it as a sword
My eyes have seen the glory of
The coming of the Lord

I burned across the Delta
I swam across the Ford
My eyes have seen the glory of
The coming of the Lord

When I was a young man, standing on this road
My empty belly, an aching hole
An old man said to me, ""Kid don't you know?""
That it's the same wherever you go

I gambled in two graveyards
I won against the odds
With the saints and with the saviors
With the maggots and the Gods

I cursed the things they showed me
I could never see again
And the howling of the wind at night
I wrote upon the rain

I found the thing for which I prayed
And came back home to the USA
With a heart of stone, so now I know
That it's the same wherever you go

Wherever you go
Wherever you go

Wherever you go
Wherever you go

Come, come here we come
Come, come here we come
Come, come here we come

One morning last July

She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself

From Galway to Dublin Town

Till my plough turns rust colored brown
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside

The Pogues,"Alligators snap at your ankles
And branches snap at your brain
If I ever get through this swamp alive
I'll nevermore pray for rain

This must be the place
And still it somehow don't seem right
Something in the moon could change
These endless days to lonely nights

I take a stroll down by the sea
And walk along the pier
Then I slip and hit my head
Now's the time to fear

I see the surface, see the rocks
See my past fly swiftly by
I feel the water in my lungs
And wake up screaming for my life

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Card sharks and blue harps
And dolphins who leap
In my blue heaven
Where I can laugh and I can weep

Black shapes zip into corners
The big lads start to crawl
To holes of their own making
In the cracks within the wall

Snakes and rats and spiders
I know that they're still there
I pray to God that I may sleep
Without a hope, without a care

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Felines and sea lions
And rain on the beach
In my blue heaven
With angels who aren't out of reach

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of Pontchartrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Nightingales sing
And the bells they will ring
In my blue heaven
The bells of Hell
Go ding a ling a ling

The Pogues,"POGUES - LORELEI 

You told me tales of love and glory
Same old sad songs, same old story
The sirens sing no lullaby
And no-one knows but Lorelei.

By castles out of fairytales
Timbers shivered where once there sailed
The lovesick men who caught her eye
And no-one knew but Lorelei.

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see...

I've thought of you in far-off places
I've puzzled over lipstick traces
So help me god, I will not cry
And then I think of Lorelei.

I travel far and wander wide
No photograph of you beside me
Ol' man river's not so shy
And he remembers Lorelei.

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see.

If I should float upon this stream
And see you in my madman's dream
I'd sink into your troubled eyes
And none would know 'cept Lorelei.

River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see.

But if my ship, which sails tomorrow
Should crash against these rocks,
My sorrows I will drown before I die
It's you I'll see, not Lorelei",Lorelei,1991
The Pogues,"I dreamt we were standing
By the banks of the Thames
Where the cold grey waters ripple
In the misty morning light
Held a match to your cigarette
Watched the smoke curl in the mist
Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us
Smiling at me

I awoke so cold and lonely
In a faraway place
The sun fell cold upon my face
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell
Turned to the wall
Pulled the sheets around my head
Tried to sleep, and dream my way
Back to you again

Count the days
Slowly passing by
Step on a plane
And fly away
I'll see you then
As the dawn birds sing
On a cold and misty morning

Down Rain Street

Father McGreer buys an ice-cold beer
And a short for Father Loyola
Father John's got the clap again
He's drinking Coca-Cola
Down on Rain Street

Bless me Father, I have sinned
I got pissed and I got pinned
And God can't help the state I'm in
Down on Rain Street

There's a Tesco on the sacred ground
Where I pulled her knickers down
While Judas took his measly price
As Saint Anthony gazed in awe at Christ
Down on Rain Street

I gave my love a goodnight kiss
I tried to take a late-night piss
But the toiled moved, so again I missed
Down Rain Street

I sat on the floor and watched TV
Thanking Christ for the BBC
A stupid fucking place to be

""Walk with me"" was her command
I dreamt we were walking on the strand

That night on Rain Street, somebody smiled

Wailing away on the wall on the strand
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned

You remember when the ship went down
You left me on the deck
The captain's corpse jumped up
And threw his arms around my neck
For all these years I've had him on my back
This debt cannot be paid with all your jack

I dreamt I met with Behan
I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day

On the crux of life's philosophies

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn
Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me
But the rope always was slack
And now that I've a pile
I'll go down to the Chelsea
I'll walk in on my feet
But I'll leave there on my back

Because I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke
Seemed the wisest of philosophies
There's nothing ever gained
By a wet thing called a tear
When the world is too dark
And I need the light inside of me
I'll walk into a bar
And drink fifteen pints of beer

I am going, I am going

He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
And they all looked very happy in the morning

But Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks when he'd had too many pours
So sad to see the grieving and the people that I'm leaving
And he took the road for god knows in the morning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again

So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)

To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane

The years went by, the times had changed I grew to be a man
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
And ended up a barman in the morning

I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
And some people left for heaven without warning

How to find your way to the end of the night
When there's nowhere left to turn
How to keep the last embers of the fire alight
When there's nothing left to burn
How to say goodbye to the ashes that fly
From the cheap metal urn

My baby's gone so far away
She's never coming back to me

She said go to sleep
You got to save
Your anger and rage for the living
'Cause they're no damn good in the grave
And don't waste your time in forgiving
The ones who just don't know how to behave
There's heaven and hell in the world that you live in
But I'm in a different place

The corner girls, they come and go
Dreaming of a ticket home

If the spirit conjures your genie
To lie beside me in my dreams
The wind is blowing a melody

We'll sit up late and watch TV

The Pogues,"The shaman came a calling
He was howling at the moon
He offered me a vision
On the end of a silver spoon
He said he'd give me dreams
That all were in his powers
If only i would follow him
The universe was ours

Walked a thin white line to the coffin club
Downstairs from the devils den
Had a large double Jesus
Chased down with a shot of zen
The last thing i remember
Was lying in the tank
And when i came around again
Everything was blank

Floating high above the world
Out on the astral plane
I'm bouncing like a pinball

I met god on primrose hill
That's where he came to me
He stepped out of his saucer
I got down on my knees
From his lips came just one word
He left me all aglow
I sat down and had a smoke
And watched the flowers grow

The bats are in the belfry
And the bubbles in the bong
The secret of the universe
Is hidden in this song

The shaman left a crawling
As the dawn broke the gloom
Talking in some other tongue
And laughing like a loon
The early morning sunlight
Splashed colours on the wall
And i don't know if it ever
Really happened at all

And the bubbles in the bong

I'll turn to stone, let the rivers flow,
And wash me to the sea

And mother, wake me early in the morning

At the time, I was working for a landlord

And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore
And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore

And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink

I recall we took care of him one Sunday
We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls
And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real
But all I know is I left that place without a penny or fuck all

And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
And mother, wake me early in the morning

I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores

Down by the Kardomah and the Centrale
To the mews running through the backstreets

The Pogues,"As I walked down by the riverside
One evening in the spring
Heard a long gone song
From days gone by
Blown in on the great North wind

Though there is no lonesome corncrake's cry
Of sorrow and delight
You can hear the cars
And the shouts from bars
And the laughter and the fights

May the ghosts that howled
Round the house at night
Never keep you from your sleep
May they all sleep tight
Down in hell tonight
Or wherever they may be

As I walked on with a heavy heart
Then a stone danced on the tide
And the song went on
Though the lights were gone

And the North wind gently sighed
And an evening breeze coming from the East
That kissed the riverside
So I pray now child that you sleep tonight

When you hear this lullaby
May the wind that blows from haunted graves
Never bring you misery
May the angels bright

Watch you tonight
And keep you while you sleep",Lullaby of London,1994

The Pogues,"Have you ever walked the lonesome hills and heard the curlews cry?
Or seen the raven black as night upon a windswept sky?
To walk the purple heather and hear the westwind cry
To know that's where the rapparee must die

Since Cromwell pushed us westward to live our lowly lives
Some of us have deemed to fight from Tipperary mountains high
Noble men with wills of iron who are not afraid to die
And who'll fight with Gaelic honor held on high

A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell, you who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell for the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers whom you robbed of their birthright
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight

Of one such man I'd like to speak a rapparee by name and deed
His family dispossessed and slaughtered they put a price upon his head
His name is known in song and story and his deeds are legends still
And murdered for blood money was young Ned of the hill

And you've robbed our homes and fortunes, even drove us from the land
You tried to break our spirit but you'll never understand
The love of dear old Ireland that will forge an iron will
As long as there are gallant men like young Ned of the hill

A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell, you who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell for the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers whom you robbed of their birthright

And all our love's together
Must I recall again
Joy would always follow
After pain

Let us stand face to face
While underneath the bridge
Of our arms entwined slow race
Eternal gazes flowing
At waves pace

Let night fall, let the hours go by
The days pass on and here stand I

Love runs away
Like running water flows
Love flows away
But oh, how slow life goes
How violent is hope
Love only knows

Let night fall, let the hours go by
The days pass on and here stand I

The weeks pass by in vain
Time never will return
Nor our loves burn again

And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind 'fore the hurricane begins
The hour when the ship comes in

Oh the seas will split and the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound and the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And the boat that drifts on to the shore line
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a touchin'
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

The foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Jerk from their beds and think they're still dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

Then they'll raise their hands sayin' we'll meet all your demands
We'll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath they'll be conquered, yeah

The Pogues,"The dawn shines her light to scare off the night
The sun from his slumber is woken
And the bells are ringing out as the town crier shouts
Words too strong to be spoken

There's a rumble in the ground and the air fills with sound
Trumpets in the wind are a blowing
And the townsfolk peep through the curtains of sleep
To the sound of the cocks all a crowin'

The winds may blow
Come rain, come snow

Clouds in the sky are unfolding
And the birds on the wing like angels they sing

Banners and flags are a waving
And the flowers all a bloom, blow kisses to the moon
As blossom falls on the paving

The winds may blow
Come rain, come snow
Today's for you and me
I gave my heart to you my love
You gave your heart to me

Strangers from Delhi to Dublin
Are swept off their feet as they kiss on the street
And the waters like champagne are bubbling

The Pogues,"My girl could break my heart
And tear my soul apart
Couldn't see myself living in a world
Without her

She's a tear, she's a scream
Takes me high but my worst dream
Could I survive living in a world
Without her?

My mommy said open the door
I didn't want to be that boy
All my friends told me I'd pull through

But all that's said and all that's done
Won't persuade me that I'm wrong
I know I'd die living in a world
Without her

All my hopes and all my dreams
Rest with her or so it seems
I never want to see the world
Without her

She's a saint, she's a clown
Picks me up when I'm down
There'd be so much missing from the world
Without her

Tangled up in falling vines
She took my hand, I know she's mine
Pickin' up the pieces of the past

Well, I awoke before the dawn
Dreamed we'd fought and she had gone
Now I know how it feels
Without her

An empty club, when we first met
Sharing our last cigarette
How could I have lived in a world
Without her

The sweetest girl I ever had
She's the best, she must be mad
There's no way I living in a world
Without her

We walked four miles to get back home
Through the crowds we walked alone
She told me all about her last stand

The sun came up and lit the scene
She looked so fine, so I see
There's no way I'm living in a world
Without her

There ain't no way I am living in a world
Without her
There's just no way I am living in a world

The Pogues,"The night stank of diesel
A stranger came to town
A cold wind blowing
And the rain pouring down

Street lights flicker
And the power lines moan
The moon beat down
On a river of bone

Someone put the lights out
No one make a sound
You won't find a thing
Down in Oretown

Foundry spits fire and smoke
Air's foul and choking
Sky is full of sulphur
Hills flat and broken

Black fogs and whirlwinds
The thunder and rain
Open drink madness
Purple mad pain

The circus is over
Exit the clowns
Nobody's laughing
Down in Oretown

The ship's in the harbor
Cargo's been pawned
Barrooms spilling sailors
All shipwrecked at dawn

Smelling of salt and rust
Uniform's torn
Came looking for flowers
Only found thorns

Dreaming of mermaids
In pearly white gowns
Captain is sleeping
Down in Oretown

There's a man down on mainstreet
Eyes all aflame
Laughing in the thunder
Of the Number 9 train

Selling old postcards in rusty frames
A thousand views of Oretown
And they all look the same

Dressed up in sandals
A barbed wire crown
A lot of people lost their minds
Down in Oretown

Lock up the lawman
Let go the thief
Round up the grey men
Nail them to a tree

This town was a palace
This town was aglow
Well, the sky burned orange
And the iron river flowed

The night stank of diesel
A stranger came to town
The night folded over

The Pogues,"Tosspint rises early
Sprung from a nightmare's claw
Thrice crows the dawn cock
The mist is on the moor

Tosspint cries from croaking gills
Thank God I'm not forsaken
From the hellish depths of sleep
At last I am awakened

Tosspint flushed his kidneys
Rained a golden shower
Pleased to piss a good pot full
He shat upon the hour

Tosspint filled his belly
With tripe and ox's tongue
Sucking pig stuffed with figs
Into his guts he flung

Full belly and the dance is merry
Where hunger reigns no strength obtains
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

Tosspint drinks lustily
And pees against the sun
All around the hoary oak
The laughing maidens run

Tosspint warms his codpiece
To the flour adds the yeast
In the field by Tanner's Mill
He plays to two-backed beast

Twist the spigot, close the hole
Stoke the fire and blow the coal
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

[Incomprehensible]
Where hunger reigns no strength obtains
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

Tosspint fell foul of dogma
And slipped into a schism
The trial was quick, the sky grew dark
They led him from the prison

Tied him to a stake of oak
Lit a fire of wood and coke
The crowd sang out ""His bacon's smoked!""
The bells rang out ""Tosspint's croaked!""

Tosspint under flaming sky
Walks through the fires of Hell
Where bestial demons threw the damned
Screaming as they fell

Into the pits of burning coals
Tosspint throws up his last bowl
Mingled with the soup
His soul

Tosspint rises early
Sprung from a nightmare's claw
Thrice crows the dawn cock
The mist is on the moor

Twist the spigot, close the hole
Stoke the fire and blow the coal
The wheel spins, the gurdy hums
Ring the bells and beat the drum

And all our love's together
Must I recall again
Joy would always follow
After pain

Let us stand face to face
While underneath the bridge
Of our arms entwined slow race
Eternal gazes flowing
At waves pace

Let night fall, let the hours go by
The days pass on and here stand I

Love runs away
Like running water flows
Love flows away
But oh, how slow life goes
How violent is hope
Love only knows

Let night fall, let the hours go by
The days pass on and here stand I

The days flow ever on
The weeks pass by in vain
Time never will return
Nor our loves burn again

Slow flows the Seine

And took the men and marched them up the hill of pain
And Lorca, the faggot poet they left till last
Blew his brains out with a pistol up his arse

But ran away in terror to search the town instead

With a fiver in my pocket and my ole dancing bag

One evening as I was lying down by leicester square
I was picked up by the coppers and kicked in the balls
Between the metal doors at vine street I was beaten and mauled
And they ruined my good looks for the old main drag

Would dribble and vomit and grovel and shout
And the coppers would come along and push them about

The Pogues,"On the fourth of July eighteen hundred and six
We set sail from the sweet cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand city hall in New York
'Twas a wonderful craft, she was rigged fore-and-aft
And oh, how the wild winds drove her
She'd stood several blasts, she had twenty-seven masts
And we called her the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses' hides
We had four million barrels of bones
We had five million hogs, had six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bales of old nanny goats' tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover

There was old Mickey Coote who played hard on his flute
When the ladies lined up for his set
He was tootin' with skill for each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his sparse witty talk he was cock of the walk
And he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance when he took up his stance
And he sailed in the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Jimmy McGurk who was scarred stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracey from Dover
And your man Mick McCann from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

For a sailor it's always a bother in life
It's so lonesome by night and by day
'Til he launch for the shore and this charming young whore
Who will melt all his troubles away
All the noise and the rout, swillin' poitín and stout
For him soon the torment's over
Of the love of a maid, he's never afraid
An old sot from the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in a fog
And that whale of the crew was reduced down to two
Just meself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock, oh Lord what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around, and the poor old dog was drowned

And how would you bloody know?

And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed

Then prayed and bled some more

Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

All I could do was hate him
While ray and Philomena sang
Of my elusive dream

I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me

So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking

And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees

But they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows out
They took you out into the street and kicked you in the brains
So you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all again
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer

You remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howl
There was lousy drunken bastards singing ""Billy In The Bowl""
They took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurch
So you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the church

Now you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocks
And they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a box
Then they'll take you to Cloughprior and shove you in the ground
But you'll stick your head back out and shout ""We'll have another round""
At the graveside of Cuchulainn we'll kneel around and pray
And God is in His heaven, and Billy's down by the bay",The Sickbed of Cuchulaínn [Live][*],2005
The Pogues,"I dreamt we were standing
By the banks of the Thames
Where the cold grey waters ripple
In the misty morning light
Held a match to your cigarette
Watched the smoke curl in the mist
Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us
Smiling at me

I awoke so cold and lonely
In a faraway place
The sun fell cold upon my face
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell
Turned to the wall
Pulled the sheets around my head
Tried to sleep, and dream my way
Back to you again

Count the days
Slowly passing by
Step on a plane
And fly away
I'll see you then
As the dawnbirds sing
On a cold and misty morning

The Pogues,"Billy ran around with the rare old crew
And he knew an arsenal from Tottenham blue
We'd be a darn sight better of if we knew
Where Billy's bones are resting now
Billy saw a copper and he hit him in the knee
And he took him down from six foot to five foot three
Then he hit him fair and square in the do-re-mi
That copper won't be having any family

Hey Billy son where are you now
Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow
Where are Billy's bones resting now

Billy went away with the peace-keeping force
Cause he liked a bloody good fight of course
Went away in an old khaki van to the banks of the river Jordan
Billy saw the Arabs and he had 'em on the run
When he got 'em in the range of his sub-machine gun
Then he had the Israelis in his sights, went a ra-ta-ta
And they ran like Shiites

Hey Billy son where are you now
Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow

One night Billy had a rare old time,
Laughing and singing on the Lebanon line
Came back to camp not looking too pretty
Never even got to see the holy city
Now Billy's out there in the desert sun
And his mother cries when the morning comes
And there's mothers crying all over this world

And the yanks they were within
And the tinker boys they hissed advice

So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip
To the shores where his father's laid

I stood there nearly lifeless
An old man in the corner sang
Where the water lilies grow
And on the jukebox johnny sang
About a thing called love
And its how are you kid and whats your name
And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin a rovin a rovin Ill go
For a pair of brown eyes

I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While ray and philomena sang
Of my elusive dream
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

Good night and joy be with you all

And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass

They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had

When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

The Pogues,"Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
In the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a Rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days",Maggie May [#],2008
The Pogues,"It was 1962 
I was two years out of school 
When I got on board a boat 
That was bound for Liverpool 
The day I went away 
I remember it so well 
Said goodbye to the North Wall 
And bid a fond farewell 

When I got down to the smoke 
It was 1963 
I got a job doing meals on wheels 
Round NW3 
I was terrorising grannies
For ten lousy bob a week
I was smashed and blacked
And drunk and yawning in NW3 

In the filth and piss they lived in 
They would sometimes hum an air 
Or talk in tongues of madness 
Keeping time upon a chair 
And for their wrists a numbered tab 
In Westminster morgue 
On a cold hard slab 
When I was still a young man 
In NW3 

Now I'm spent of love and rage
And I'm going home again
Never did nobody wrong
Never earned a decent wage
So thanks for sweet fuck all
Once more look at the North Wall
Say goodbye to all of that
And bid a fond farewell

At the top of the Pentonville Road 
I watched the sun setting 
The town spread out before me 
Looked beautiful to me 
Away from all the sighing
The suffering and the dying
I dreamed of the future 
Of the young and the free 

But the years they went by quickly 
Now I swear I won't return here 
Where each day just bring me closer 
To the final misery 
My kids will never scrape shit round here 
I won't die crying in a pint of beer 
Or eat their stinking meals on wheels

I never minded the rain on my face 
I knew the sun lived in some other place 
I had to go I just needed the space 
But I'm not down for the first time 
Maybe I'll always be the one and only girl for me

The Pogues,"'Twas in the merry month of June from me home I started
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut the stout black thorn to be on the shores to Dublin
Brand new pair of brogues rattlin' o'er the bogs
Fightin' all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack follol de rah

In Mullingar that night I rested tired and weary
Left the room next morning feeling bright and airy
Had a drop of the pure to keep me heart from sinking
That's a Paddy's cure whene'er he's on the drinking
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required
Till I was sick and tired of the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack follol de rah

In Dublin next arrived I thought it such a pity
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
When I took a stroll all among the quality
Me bundle it was stole in the neat locality
Something crossed me mind when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Asking for the rogue, they called me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack follol de rah

From there I got away, me spirits never failing
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared that no more room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubblin'
When off Holyhead wished that I was dead
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack follol de rah

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly
Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobblin'
With a loud ""hurray!"" joined in the affray
Quietly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

The Pogues,"Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
And they all looked very happy in the morning

Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
When he'd had too many powers
So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving
And he took the road for god knows in the morning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
(Far away) sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)

To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane

The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
And ended up a barman in the morning

I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
And some people left for heaven without warning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone

He asked me all the details of the train that they went on

The Pogues,"McCormack and Richard Tauber are singing by the bed
There's a glass of punch below your feet and an angel at your head
There's devils on each side of you with bottles in their hands
You need one more drop of poison and you'll dream of foreign lands

When you pissed yourself in Frankfurt and got syph down in Cologne
And you heard the rattling death trains as you lay there all alone
Frank Ryan bought you whiskey in a brothel in Madrid
And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the Yids
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair

And in the Euston Tavern you screamed it was your shout
But they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows out
They took you out into the street and kicked you in the brains
So you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all again
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair

You remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howl
There was lousy drunken bastards singing ""Billy In The Bowl""
They took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurch
So you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the church

Now you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocks
And they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a box
Then they'll take you to Cloughprior and shove you in the ground
But you'll stick your head back out and shout ""We'll have another round""

Lights awake down a misty lane
See a rainbow every time it rains.

Lost in the stars with the satellites

The Pogues,"The cadillac stood by the house
And the yanks they were within
And the tinker boys they hissed advice
'Hot-wire her with a pin'
Then we turned and shook as we had a look
In the room where the dead men lay
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip
To the shores where his father's laid

But fifteen minutes later
We had our first taste of whiskey
There was uncles giving lectures
On ancient Irish history
The men all started telling jokes
And the women they got frisky
By five o'clock in the evening
Every bastard there was piskey

Fare thee well, going away
There's nothing left to say
Farewell to New York City boys, to Boston and PA
He took them out with a well-aimed clout
And we often heard him say
I'm a free-born man of the USA

He fought the champ in Pittsburgh
And he slashed him to the ground
He took on Tiny Tartanella
And it only went one round
He never had no time for reds
For drink or dice or whores
And he never threw a fight until the fight was right
So they sent him to the war

Fare the well, gone away
There's nothing left to say
With a slainte Joe and Erin go
My love's in Ameri-kay
The calling of the rosary
Spanish wine from far away
I'm a free born man of the USA

This morning on the harbour
When I said goodbye to you
I remember how I swore
That I'd come back to you one day
And as the sunset came to meet the evening on the hill
I told you I'd always love you
I always did and I always will

Fare thee well gone away

The Pogues,"We signed up in San Antone, my brother Paul and me
To fight with Ben McCulloch and the Texas infantry
Well the poster said we'd get a uniform and seven bucks a week
The best rations in the army and a rifle we could keep

When I first laid eyes on the general I knew he was a fightin' man
He was every inch a soldier, every word was his command
Well his eyes were cold as the lead and steel forged into tools of war
He took the lives of many and the souls of many more

Well they marched us to Missouri and we hardly stopped for rest
And then he made this speech and said, ""We're comin' to the test""
Well we've got to take Saint Louie boys before the Yankees do
If we control the Mississippi then the Federals are through

Well they told us that our enemy would all be dressed in blue
Well they forgot about the winter's cold and the cursed fever too
My brother died at Wilson's Creek and Lord I seen him fall
We fell back to the Boston Mountains in the north of Arkansas

Goddamn you Ben McCulloch
I hate you more than any other man alive
And when you die you'll be a foot soldier just like me
In the Devil's infantry

And on the way to Fayetteville we cursed McCulloch's name
And mourned the dead that we'd left behind and we was carrying the lame
I killed a boy the other night who'd never even shaved
I don't even know what I'm fightin' for, I ain't never owned a slave
So I snuck out of camp and then I heard the news next night
The Yankees won the battle and McCulloch lost his life, yeh

Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
Some of them fell into Hell

I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms

I sang you all my sorrows
You told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song
To all those little girls and boys?

Now, the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
But there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams, the measure of my dreams

Sometimes I'd wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I'd hear you talking in my head

I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the first times
I never think about the last

Acting out an untold story like a 
Wounded child

Won't hide

Returning from the war
Though I know she knew the truth
She also knew much more
And the answer that she gave to all of us
Whispered low saying
True love survives
True love survives

Is she dreaming does she know
A secret I can't see
Maybe there's a trace of truth
In all that she believes

For one day I took a look deep down inside
A voice cried saying true love's alive
True love survives

Only love will last forever true love will survive
Only love will last forever true love will survive

True is love is never-ending
It's giving all and not pretending
It's holding on although your heart 
Feels dead

Easy days, that's when love can make you feel

We'll have those easy days when we can lay around
And let the children play
And let choirs of angel sing our love to the world

And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

When the sky's blue above and you're happy
Dreamin' of who you love but you only
Make believe he is near
There so much for you to see, do and go here
So relax your mind I'm sure you'll find

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

Needing things, when I have so much.

Day by day they make their way.
And they find more in life thank I can see.
Tell me,

When will I learn to resist
Wanting things,
Touching things that say ""do not touch.""
Peo-ple that I meet seem to think I am strong,
They don't see inside of me.

Can make you see and feel

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone

And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

That's why it seems like a dream
Got me hypnotized
And I know that's right

Seems like a dream

Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will

The Pointer Sisters,"As the midnight moon, was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
Seein' what you wanted to see

Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night

Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooo, we got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I've got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush

I found somebody who will understand

And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night

Flowers arrive
Who else would think of that but my guy
He's all heart and all mine
Ooh, and I don't have to be Miss Perfect One
For him to love what he sees
I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found he's every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
Ooh, what he does just keeps my heart in love
My baby he's a goldmine
Ooh, all he does just keeps me here in love

Five times a day
He calls me up to say, ""How ya doin' babe?""
He's just that way
Leaves me little notes by my coffee cup
The sweetest poetry to me
Ooh, and every night he tells me with his touch
The way he moves just makes me want to scream

His eyer were fire, my heart was cold
My arms were ready for new love to hold
He makes me feel something that I've never known
When you find someone like him, you don't let go

Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine

I can feel the little things that he does
What I found is every woman's dream

I couldn't sleep a wink
And I could only get unconscious
If I'd had to much to drink

There was somehow, something wrong somewhere,
And each day seemed grey and dead
The seeds of desperation
Were growing in me head

I needed inspiration,
A brand new start in life,
Somewhere to place affection,
But I didn't want a wife

And then by lucky chance I saw
In a special magazine
An ad that was unusual,
The like I'd never seen,

""Experience something different
With our new imported toy,
She's loving, warm, inflatable
And a guarantee of joy""

She came all wrapped in cardboard,
All pink and shriveled down
A breath of air was all she needed
To make her lose that frown

I took her to the bedroom
And pumped her with some life,
And later in a moment
That girl became my wife

And so I sit her in the corner
And sometimes stroke her hair
And when I'm feeling naughty
I blow her up with air

She's cuddly and she's bouncy,
She's like a rubber ball,
I bounce her in the kitchen
And I bounce her in the hall

And now my life is different
Since Sally came my way
I wake up in the morning
And have her on a tray

She's everything they say she was
And I wear a permanent grin,
And I only have to worry
In case my girl wears thin

First you make a stone of your heart
And if you find that your hands are still willing
Then you can turn a murder into art

There really isn't any need for bloodshed

Then it avoids an awful lot of mess

If you're flushed with your very first success

It's a habit-forming need for more and more
You can bump off every member of your family
And anybody else you find a bore

And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand

And when you've made your secret journey
You will find this love you miss

I listened to his words
I strained to understand him

But you've no excuse for the people you abuse

Sack your roadies in Birmingham
When your record is platinum, you can stick it to the bath

Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away there's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore

With our new imported toy
She's loving, warm, inflatable
And a guarantee of joy""}

To make her lose that frown}

And pumped her with some life
And so in a moment later
That girl became my wife}

And sometimes stroke her hair
And when I'm feeling naughty
I blows her up with air}

I bounce her in the hall}

Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away there's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

On your hand his golden rings like he owns a bird that sings.

When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.
The priest has said my soul's salvation is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion.
I keep the faith in my fashion.

When we dance angels will run and hide their wings.
(I will love you more than life if you'll only be my wife.)
(I'm gonna love you night and day. I'm gonna try in every way.)
When we dance angels will run and hide their wings.
(I'm gonna find a place to live, give you all I've got to give.)
(I will love you more than life if you'll only be my wife.)
If I could break down these walls and shout my name at heaven's gate,
I'd take these hands and I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate.
Cathedrals are broken, heaven's no longer above,
And hell fire's a promise away I'd still be saying I'm still in love.
Still in love, still in love, still in love, still in love

He won't love you, like I love you.
He won't care for you this way.
He'll mistreat you if you stay.

Come and live with me.
We'll have children of our own.
I would love you more than life if you'll come and be my wife.
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.
When we dance.
(I'm gonna love you night and day. I'm gonna try in every way.)

But all he ever thinks to do is watch.
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch.

Only the rush hour hell to face.
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes.
Contestants in a suicidal race.

So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to sigh in

News guy wept and squarely told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, had no room to spare
I had to cram so much everything in there

All the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
Never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

And I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years stuck on my eyes

They were not to be believed

Like a most improbable dream, improbable dream

But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here let me show you

This thing is called a present
And the whole thing starts with a box
A box? Is it steel? Are there locks?
Is it filled with a pox? A pox, how delightful, a pox

If you please just a box with bright colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow
Bow? Bow? But why? How ugly, what's in it? What's in it?
That's the point of the thing, not to know

It's a bat, will it bend?
It's a rat, will it break?
Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake

Listen now you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land
Now pay attention we pick up an over sized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

Oh, yes, does it still have a foot? Let me see, let me look
Is it rotted and covered with gook?
Hmm, let me explain there's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

Small toys, do they bite? Do they snap or explode in a sack
Or perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys?
What a splendid idea, this Christmas sounds fun
Why I fully endorse it, let's try it at once

Everyone please not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last

For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
At least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told that he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
And sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms

And on a dark cold night under full moonlight
He flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited though they don't understand
