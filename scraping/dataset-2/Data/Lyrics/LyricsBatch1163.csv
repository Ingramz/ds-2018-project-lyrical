The New Amsterdams,"I know that it burns like poison in the pill
You sing in your sleep, it echoes in the hills
You can't hear a word
You can't hear my broken will

The world through a windshield
Is callous and cheap
I toss and I turn I can't get to sleep
Counting the hours
The days that turn into weeks

I've been wrong, but it's alright
They've been long and lonely nights
I was lost till I found you
I'm turnin' out the light
I'll stay if you want me to

Somehow my time got outta my hands
I just wanna stop, master commands
Telling the truth won't be this way again
A long ways away, but you're never alone
I look at the sky, over our home
I'll be around; a few more miles to go

I've been wrong, but it's alright
They've been long and lonely nights
I was lost till I found you
I'm turnin' out the light
I'll stay if you want me to

You don't have to say it
You don't have to speak
I've been away, worried and weak
Don't say a word

I've been wrong, but it's alright
They've been long and lonely nights
I was lost till I found you
I'm turnin' out the light
I'll stay if you want me to",Turn Out the Light,2006
The New Amsterdams,"Your ghost is haunting the alleyways
Pacing the tracks where you tread
Seeking the solace of sleep
Maybe you don't know you're dead

Witness the worst of your history
Only to chase it again
Discreet but curiously
Repeating the act in the end

Lonely and grieving will your god take me too
This won't be the memory I will carry of you
I watch the sea, you lied to me
I will wait but the day never comes

Tempt me to change things
Because I've got the will and the blade
But my sins have cursed me
So I wander the rest of my days

Lonely and grieving will your god take me too
This won't be the memory I will carry of you
I believed it killed me
It's too late for the truth

I watch the sea, you lied to me
I will wait but the day never comes
Your ghost is haunting the alleyways
Maybe you don't know you're dead
",Your Ghost,2006
The New Amsterdams,"You tell me I've got better things to do but I'm all spent
Tally up the time that I've been waiting here for you
Haven't seen you in so long
I blink and then you're gone

Had a conversation with a friend, you're a big part
He's in that place with you that
I used to be in story like a scar
A novel?s worth so far that you'll write

Shouted the thing, I'm drowning in the drink
And I get lost in the memories
And so it seems all too common themes
You got lost, you got a way out

I had a dream the other night, we were good then
And you told me all about the better place you're in
I know you just too well
It?s hard for me to tell if you're lying

Shouted the thing, drowning in the drink
And I get lost in the memories
And so it seems all too common themes
You got lost, you got a way out

Shouted the thing, I'm drowning in the drink
You got lost, you got a way out
Shouted the thing, drowning in the drink
You got lost, you got a way out

Way down the river I can hear her whistle blow.

Can't you hear that rumblin' sound
Lord, I think we've run aground
No fathoms below

We're muckin' bottom, and here comes ol' Dixie
Singin' who's got that cotton to sell?
Ah, but when she's passin'
We're risin' high on her swell.

We're on the move again.

These two riverboats, racin' up the river,
Then ol' Dixie runs aground
There she stands high and dry,
And we're walkin' right on by

We're gonna roll that cotton down

Lot of cotton, you can bet.
You can ask anyone you meet,

The New English Rock Ensemble,"By horse, by rail, by land, by sea, our journey starts
Two men incensed by one man's journey from the past
In Iceland, where the mountain stood with pride
They set off with their guide
To reach the mountain side

Roped as one for safety through the long descent
Into the crater of volcanic rock they went
Look up from our telescopic laair,
One star for us to share,
We continue on our prayer.

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.

Memories of a life on earth go flashing past,
Of home, of Grauben, friends of whom he's seen his last
Contemplating what his life's been worth,
While trapped beneath the earth,
An embryo at birth

Pain and fear destroy the beauty I have seen,
Of caverns, where no other man has been
Silurian epoch hosts me as my grave,
My final blow I wave,
A life too late to save

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.


Five days out on an infinite sea, they prayed for calm on an ocean free,
But the surface of the water ws indicating some disturbance.

The raft was hurled by an unseen source, two hundred feet, with
  frightening force
And a dark mass rising showed to be a giant porpoise

Rising out of the angry sea, towered the creatures' enemy,
And so the two sea monsters closed for battle

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye, stained ocean red
Moving close to their raft's side, the two men prayed as one and cried
""Save me, save me, save me, save me""

The serpents' fight went on for hours, two monsters soaring up like towers
And driving downn to the depths in a single motion

Suddenly, the serpent's head, shot out of the water bathed in red
And the serpentine form lay lifeless on the ocean

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye stained ocean read
Battle won, a victor's pride, the three men thanked the Lord and cried
""Praise God, praise God, praise God, praise God.""

Journey on through ages gone, to the centre of the earth
Past rocks of quartz and granite, which gave mother nature birth

Burial ground of ancient man, his life no more is seen,
A journey through his time unknown, I wonder where he's been

Wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been

The shore now gone behind the hills, a forest in our sight,
Rocks and distant mountains, bathed in waves of blinding light

Forests from far gone time, no living man has seen,
A private prehistoric world, for you and I a dream

Brownish hue dicates my eye, no colour hides their fear,
Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere

Creatures twisting under trees, huge monsters soaked with rage
Hidden deep below our earth, a frightening, bygone age

Their shepherd came, now long extinct, a huge primeval man
The three men filled with disbelief, just turned as one and ran.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

I feel much better when the sun has lost its glow
When the light of day is fading away
And there are shadows wherever I go
Yes the light is fading and I'm masquerading
As a poet with something to say
The inspiration's gone and I can't turn it on
It's been the same since she went away.

Than an Irish man who worked an honest day
From Steamboat Row, in rain or shine, he'd make his way down to the mine
Along the dusty road he'd travel
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine
He said he'd never go back down again
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could
Kept on walkin' down that road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

That his days were quickly coming to an end

To the place where she was dwelling,

And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say

And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

And every stroke to her did say

And I will die of sorrow.

But I said it so you'd feel involved with this song

Are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned
Because I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
I hope I didn't just give away the ending

We caught a fey taxi driver
I smiled the ride was free
I felt like Amsterdam
She wanted more drugs and maybe me
I told her dealer I was broke
He hired a cameraman
We did a porno film for coke
I hear I'm big in Japan

Are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned
Because I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
I hope I didn't just give away the ending

We went back to her kitchen 
Put the coke in a can
Tied up a TV minister
In walked her dad
He started drinking coffee
Too much sugar on the go
He fell dead on the floor
He thought the coke was sweet ?n low

Well are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned

Boy she was upset but then just stole her dad's wallet and
I drove him to the hospital
To sell all of his donatable body parts
And this is when she dies
They brought a depressed junkie in
She shot his cyanide up
I guess she thought it was Errol Flynn
I'm blamed in the confusion
The police being phoned
I don't even love you
We weren't even friends

It's just that I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
Uh huh
I can't take it alone
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending

But didn't know in '63 he had died

Does she think I'll rob her and run
When I ask her she gets her gun

And isn't it wonderful to be alive

So original in her black lipstick
Listening to some obscure band
That's okay she's helping the environment
By sipping pure water and such
Then she screams we better start thinking about

I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

And show the world all the love in your heart 
The people gonna treat you better 
You're gonna find, yes you will 
That you're beautiful as you feel 
Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing 
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by 
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing 
And they don't see it showing, why do I? 
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face 
And show the world all the love in your heart 
The people gonna treat you better 
You're gonna find, yes you will 
That you're beautiful as you feel 
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness 
In a world where tears are just a lullaby 
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness 
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

The New Seekers,"sometimes it just don't pay to get out of bed
seems like the whole world is overworked and underfed
but life is lovely with sweet surprises
you never know what it will do
and just when you plan on another rainy day
the sun comes shinging through
somebody's singing a brand new song 
something in the words you never heard before
it isn't the symphony just a simple melody
but it's a song about love we can always use one one more
sundown you're rundown
sad eyed long faced
alone without a friend
not much more you can do 
just when you plan another lonely night 
she reaches out for you

nobody you meet could ever see 
the loneliness there inside you.

Hey there! Georgie girl
why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try, or is it the clothes you wear?
You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy.
So shed those dowdy feathers and fly a little bit.

Bring out all the love you hide and 
oh, what a change there'd be,

The New Seekers,"Aeons ago the legends tell we rode onward
Led astray by the northern chaos gods
Calm before the storm we came from the north
Horses roamed in the open landscaped

The scald sang to their kings
Only he who battle wins
The scald sang to their kings
Let the battle he fought to the won

Tremble with fear for the banner of our kings
War now calls heed to the battle
Hear our swords clinging in the wind
Men cast from their saddles horses roar and scream
Descendants of wrath and the kingdoms of fear

The might we possess burn like fire
The will remain in our northern hearts
More scalps to be won, an eye for an eye

Aeons ago the legends tell we rode onward
Led astray by the northern chaos gods
One by one by the northern tribe you fall
One by one, die by the strongest of them all
Still there's only greatness sunged in those who fell
Who battled strong to win these wars
One by one we took your lives

Grey mist swirl across the meadows
Where battles once ruled the steps
Where the ancient armours of bronce
Are buried and corrored by time
Strong where those who won the war
And the legends tell only of wrath
As brothers of the northern tribes
They guarded the horders of chaos
We leave this Battlefields ground
Red where the rivers of blood
Unforgotten by the ones
Born of strength and glory

Hear our swords clinging in the wind
Men cast from their saddles horses roar and scream",One by One,2006

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.

Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,

And never tilts at all

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.

And he just does the rest.

Through the window
We're riding with the sun 
I feel your heart beat
The morning light plays in your eyes
With floating blue and white skyline
A city in the skies for Isabella
We're gazing through the clouds
We sail the wind rose (four winds)
The break of day sparks my desire 
And ocean waves won't quench the fire 
We kiss we're high, we're riders in the sky
The city lies below
A silhouette, a glow
A tale of passion
I close my eyes (full flaps downs)
You hold me tight
We touch the ground

Our hopes are riding over the city
We search the busy streets
We're not alone here

And if it starts to rain 
We'll take a train",Isabella,1987

The Newbees,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

The Nicholas Brothers,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo,1998
The Nicholas Brothers,"I was strolling out one evening by the silvery moon
I could hear somebody singing a familiar tune
So I stopped a while to listen
Not a word I wanted to miss
It was just somebody serenading something like this

Mandy
There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee
So don't you linger
Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?
Come along and let the wedding chimes
Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

[Chorus]

Oh, what a wonderful day
Cupid, the parson, he'll say

I'm feeling kind of nervous to hear the wedding service
Now we'll hear the wedding bells, soon we'll hear the baby yells

Wait just a minute, my dear
I have the ring, never fear

What a fine ovation from all of our relations

Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita,1996

The Nields," want to be beautiful, so I got a magazine
But it made me so sleepy, and now I'm in a dream
A voice says, ""Go down to the river between the bridge and the ravine
And don't come out of the water till your light shines clean""

I put my head underwater, it's like my childhood room
But the water won't clean me, it smells like women's perfume
How can I wash my sins away with the water from this poisoned stream?
And how can I get my light to shine when I don't know if I can be redeemed?

Chorus

I saw the Rocky Mountains on a dirty TV screen
But when I tried to polish it, I found that it was clean

You let me be who I want to be
And we'll be easy from now on, from now on

Chorus

Why can't I be easy, why can't I be easy like you?

For you I would give the songs I write, the words I pray, the morning light

He takes that Woody Guthrie pose
And says, ""I'll buy you cigarettes when you get older.""
But that's not what we want anyway
We came out to hear him play
Our own curbside concert, Friday at the Circle K
Hey hey, hey hey, Friday at the Circle K

We gather every week
To hear our own rest stop poet, though he can't really sing on key
Who cares? There's music in the streets
And he plays his guitar as if she's a girl like me
And now he's looking my way
And I can't think of one thing to say
La da da da dee da, Friday at the Circle K
Hey hey, hey hey, Friday at the Circle K

And when he touches me, it thrills me down to the curb
But if he saw my fantasies, he'd know how I am disturbed!
They go like this:

I follow where he goes
To Greenwich Village and San Francisco
He shows me everything he knows
And he will be a singer and I will be a singer too
And he will play guitar every day
And I will play guitar every day

Put a smile on my face and some shoes on my feet
Tend to overlook what I've been through
Lived a life in the sun now the damage is you

'Cause it goes round round round
Round round round
The sun goes down down
Down down down

Shining alone my star of Rio
Driving along the moonlit sands
Shining alone
And all I feel
Slipping like pearls right through my hands
Shining alone my star of Rio
You'll always light my empty skies
Although you're gone I still can feel
You're always there and for tonight
You will be my guiding light
'Cause my Rio she's a riddle

When I look into your turquoise eyes
There's no doubt in my mind, I'll be safe 'till I die
Turning every coin that I ever earned
Just to be with you, hope you want me too

'Cause she's a real go-getter
She's got a lot at stake
She's a desperate woman
She'll always win you over when no one else will be there

She had all sensible shoes and said

So tell me something new
I should be spending
My time with you

I should be holding hands with you
I should be making love with you

To steal the queen of Neverland
'Cause I was in her neighborhood
Feeling just like Robin Hood

With only our love to protect us
Hoping they won't detect us
Through the castle's open air
Sliding down the spiral stairs

I do believe I have a plan
To steal the queen of Neverland
I slipped into her room and said
""Come with me the king is dead""

In the name of lustful just rewards
As knights shall fall upon their swords
And grant this poor boy's wish tonight
To make the queen a noble wife

I do believe I have a plan
To steal the queen of Neverland
When I come breaking down her door
She's the one I'm looking for

It's wrong, all right, all right

I'll do whatever I must do
Scale the walls to be with you
And word will spread throughout the land

The Night Watchmen,"I'll tell you all the story of Beauty
A long-legged high-heeled lady
She ruled the streets like she was a queen
She was hot and black and mean
Beauty fell in love with a girl
Who was white like a string-of-pearls
Her name was Mandy Moans-in-the-Morning
She was a curse and she was a blessing

Well I ain't no demon sister
But I ain't no angel too
Before you can walk on me
I'm gonna walk out the door on you

Late one night at The Blue Dog
Full of whiskey and beer and gin
Beauty saw her lover Mandy
Dancing with a beast of a man
She said, ""Papa get your hands off my baby
Papa get your hands off my girl
Papa you best be careful
Or I'll take you out of this world""

Well I ain't no demon sister
But I ain't no angel too
Before you can walk on me
I'm gonna walk out the door on you

Beauty drew a gun from her thigh
There was a struggle and there was a fight
There was a shot and a puddle of blood
And a man laying there on the rug

That was the end of Beauty
A long-legged high-heeled lady
Her body was hung from an oak tree
When the sun went down on Sunday
They dug up Beauty's bones
And put them on display

Music and words will kill me or save me once again

Spending money like a rich kid
Drinking like a camel's hump
Lovin' you like a dead man or a writer stuck in a slump
Well I wrote this song on the back of a bag that once held a bottle of gin
Now you gamble somewhere between heaven and hell waiting to cash it all in

The only way to live is to love again or just burn out in love’s flame
Music and words will kill me or save me once again

Now I can’t stand up and you won’t sit down

Come on and dance like the devil is the leader of a country that is ruled by the wealthy few
And the armies of the angels got their rifles pointed at you and they're coming down to show you the truth
Are you tired of all the politics or just blind to all the lunatics?

But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack

Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness

The Nightwatchman,"On Monday I wished it was Tuesday night
So I could wish for the weekend to come
On Tuesday I wished that the night would pass
So I could call you on the phone
Now a man can spend a lot of time
Wondering what was on Jack Ruby's mind 
And time is all I have without you here 

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too
They're out there making history
In the Lenin Shipyards today
And here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

There's always room for one more soul
Down in the Human Zoo
I don't want you to come here though
I want to come home to you
Somebody's knocking at the door
Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

On Friday I wished there was something more
To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday
Oh will this torment ever end
Sometimes I get a notion to put a torch
To the tools of my trade
Here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

The Nightwatchman,"Battle hymns for the broken, battle hymns for the misled
Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten and the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

Can you explain to the mothers and the fathers of those
Who come riding home in coffins in their military clothes?
Shiny medals pinned to their dead teenage chests
While the trumpets blare and you lie your best
So ask all you want from the dusk till the dawn
The answer's still, no, 'cause, brother, I'm gone

Battle hymns for the broken, battle hymns for the misled
Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten and the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

Can you explain away the sleight of hand and the criminality
Of spending souls for oil? Well, in the mirror I can see
I am the path that leads down, I am the dark and bloody hall
I'm the reaper, executioner, hangman, judge and the law
So tie a yellow ribbon 'round the oak tree on the lawn
But the cavalry's not comin' 'cause, brother, they're gone

Battle hymns for the broken, battle hymns for the misled
Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten and the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

So I'm sharpening my shovel, I'm firing the kiln
I'm blind and I am purposeful, a martyr on the hill
The dream you might be dreaming might be someone else's dream tonight
I'm the whisperer of misgivings, I'm the fading tail light
I'm the call for retribution from the back of the smoke filled hall
I'm the vow of bitterness, I'm the poison in the well

I've a photographic memory of the deeds I will avenge
I'm the cold in the river hollow, I've a hat-pin, I've a plan
I don't care of cause or consequence, head shaved and body lean
I'm the go-getter, the score settler, I'm the shadow on the green
And there's a flock of blackbirds flying, nearly ten thousand strong
Who set off this morning and, brother, they're gone

Battle hymns for the broken, battle hymns for the misled
Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten, for the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

À part sucer la rue dis moi tu sers à quoi?
J'reste au rez-de-chaussée pour pas voir ces pétasses
Parce qu'ils viennent nous sucer quand on monte à l'étage
Pourtant ils le savent
La confiance est trompeuse, elle est parfois létale
Ta loyauté t'emmène à l'hôpital
Et si t'as la mentale tu garderas la vida
Mais si tu l'as pas c'est la mort inévitable
Même avec des gros sous faut rester respectable
Que du gros pas de détails on fait graille le bétail

""À chaque fois qu'tu les baise c'est comme si j'les baisais""
Si t'es trop gentil ils vont t'prendre pour un p'tit
T'appuies sur des pédales, t'avances au ralenti

Under branches lit up by the moon.
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore,

As the days disappeared far too soon.
Now I wandered much further today than I should,
And I can't find my way to the three-acre wood.
So help me if you can, I've got to get 

Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one. 
You'll be surprised, there's so much to be done, 
Count all the bees in the hive, 
Chase all the clouds from the sky, 

Back to the days of Christopher Robin, 
And Pooh. 
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do, 
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose. 

He came to me asking help and advice, 
And from here no one knows where he goes. 
So I went in to ask of the Owl, if he's there, 
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear.

Just to see if he's alive
Then he'd sing his banjo song of Santa Rosa

Whoa-oh, high and low-oh-oo
Then one day, sang ol' Craig,
I'll be free to go my way

Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love

She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven

She promised someday to become my sweet wife

Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go

I shut down every young girl I found

That saved a wretch like me

My heart to fear.

How precious did that Grace appear

We have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home.

His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"We met on the highway, she flagged me down, 
Had a flat on her Stingray with nobody around 
I helped her out, she said climb in 
So I ditched my ol truck just to see where the party would end. 

We spent the weekend in Reno in the honeymoon suite, 
Never saw the casino, barely took time to eat. 
I never dreamed she would take me this far 
But by Sunday that lady had taken a hold of my heart. 

It's a modern day romance, a new kind of game 
With no time to slow dance in the fast lane. 
I tried to love her without any strings 
But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain. 

She never said good-bye, just a note by the phone 
Said "";thanks for the good times, but it's time to move on.""; 
Well I'm out here walkin' with my thumb in the air 
Wondering where she might've gone and why I even care.

I know that they don't understand her

[Chorus]
She's just dancin' to the beat of a broken heart
Searchin' for comfort with strangers in the dark
It's just her way to fight another lonely night
Dancing to the beat of a broken heart

She's the center of attention
Every time she comes in here
And as she dances by my table
I see the traces of the tears
There's someone somewhere she's not over
She's just looking for a shoulder

I left Tennessee very much alive
And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-ridin' that Tennessee stud

I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hos like the Tennessee stud

We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande
I raced my hos with the Spaniard's foal
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and the gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee stud

The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

A-Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too

We loped right back across Arkansas
I whoop her brother and I whoop her pa
When I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was A-ridin' that Tennessee mare (whoa, boy)

The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hos like the Tennessee stud

We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide
We came into Big Muddy then we forded a flood
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud

There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor
A little hos colt playin' 'round the door
I love the girl with golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare (They're good hoses)

And how a promise never made can not be broken
And can never break your heart

And all her crinolines were billowing
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.

As each of them was drawn inside her dream,
And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet
And hollered at her ""dance little jean""

'Cause I knew what this get together meant
How it ended year of tears and sad confusion
That the little girl had spent.

But we played as long as they stayed

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"She's history
No one would give her a star on the walk
She'd have a hundred if pillows could talk
Where have I seen her before?
She's the face on the cutting room floor

It's no mystery
Acting in school at the tenderest age
Lit up the room when she stepped on the stage
Came to la for some more
She's the face on the cutting room floor

She had visions of contracts
And thousands of people in line
To see her;
Knocking on door after door after all of this time,
Now she's not sure

Up in hollywood
Stayed with an agent she met in a bar
Laughed when he told her he'd make her a star
Where has she heard that before?
She's the face on the cutting room floor

One night he told her that she'd never get anywhere
In her clothes
That's what it takes to play movieland musical chairs
Now she knows

Goodbye hollywood
Leaving tonight on the 2:30 'hound
Sunrise or sunset she won't be around
But they'll replace her with so many more
She's the face on the cutting room floor
Poor little face on the cutting room floor

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"Way back in my memory there's a scene that I recall 
Of a little run-down cabin in the woods 
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold 
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back 
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong

But mama kept the Bible read, and daddy kept our family fed
And somewhere in between I must have grown 
'Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin' 
Takes me down the road to where I want to go

Now I know it's a long, hard road 
Sometimes, I remember when I stay up late at night
When the sun up came, we got up and went 
In the shadows of a working day, our moonlight hours spent 
Singin' songs along with grandma's radio

Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack
Livin' in my memories all in vain 
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like 
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain

Mama played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where my name is known

Now I'm gone, and it's a long, hard road

It could be all right, so fine

Or try to put yourself above it,

To the mornin', my woman, and love.
Tall pine trees are pointin' us easily to heaven above.

They take the chill away fine.

There's a worn red chair by the window
That we found at a sale down the way
When some old women said that they needed more room for the winter.
People like pullin' at the stuffin' when they sit down.
It helps passin' the time.

That you feel to good to go away.
And you make me feel fine.
And you make my world a warmer place
By the sparklin' of your diamond face.
On a frayed spot put a little lace.
And you make me feel fine.
Warm as the mountain sunshine
On the edge of the snow line
In a meadow of columibine.

Oh little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for
What you got on your mind.
Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.
Maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is
Slightly less than devine.

In the walls that are keepin' me warm.

Wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car

I found the notes to hang them on
I fround a way to play with the meaning of things
And I came up with a couple good songs.
And so I oughta have an easy answer,
I oughta have some pretty things to say,
But I haven't found the combination
That'll make you change your mind and wanna stay.

So I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket
And I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours

Listen to the laughter of the children
She scratched on the back of a bill
As we climbed past the road to the schoolhouse
On the burnt crust browning pan hill
To where they don't take sad for an answer,
A place at the corner of your heart,
Where music meets with memories,
So you can recognize the feeling from the start

How I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket?
I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours
They'll put us on the radio so you'll know that I am yours

I've driven this road as a friend
I've driven this road as a slack-jawed tourist
And I'm drivin on it once again
It might be cold and long and lonely
But she's waiting on the other side
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And joyfully I ride.

I climb through georgetown, silver plume
The tunnel at lovelands cove/cold?
The lake on the left is a little low
Route 9 is the breckenridge road? ?
There's a sign right below copper mountain
Telling wheter independence runs free/where the weather & independence run free
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And that's where I wanna be

In the evening shadow of red butte
Up the lane from the slaughter house bridge
The first cabin the moonlight strikes as it crests the cleft in hunter crick ridge
Up frombetween old red and smuggler
Rising high on a piano bench there
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And what lies between beware
What lies between, beware

And the red sandstone sentinels rising high on either side
As I follow the eagle valley
Through the canyon where the saints reside
In mt snowmasss majesty south
And east out of glennwood springs
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
Where the roaring river sings
Where the roaring river sings.

With nothing but the blue between me and japan

You'd never know that it was christmas eve.
The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,
And the temperature is 84 degrees.
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.

From telluride to boulder down below
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow

I remember christmases when I was just a boy
In the morning I would run to see the tree.
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.
Now the sun is setting in the california sky
And I can't find the spirit anywhere
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye

Fall asleep laughing with the whipporwill

In a small room with your love on my mind

The snow will come when geese are callin'

How Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes

And a sapphire belly

By the side of the sea
Took odds to turn back
To the moon in the trees

Where a green cloud of birds
In a flock of a thou'
Yelled from one to another
It's morning out loud

""It's morning, it's morning
It's morning"", they cried
From the edge of the treetops
To the edge of the skies

""It's morning, it's morning
It's morning"", they cried
So open your heart
When you open your eyes

And the sound of their voices
Together did blend
Forming chords of awakening
If I'm not here again

For they shouted
Never again would they fly
In such numbers across
Such a primitive sky

And they noticed my heart
As it sank to the sand
Do not hurry they called
It's all part of a plan

So many times that my memories are worn

Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

Late last night when it all shut down

I went looking for trains on the torn up tracks
With a weary conductor, he just turned his back but he's still there

Looking up old lovers and long lost friends
Just to reminisce like the veterans and survivors

Say he got alittle stale and he's been replace
Still we all bowed our heads when he said grace at the diner

Now it all begins to look the same

We have come into this lifetime
With only a few things on our side
Although we are only mortal men
The choice to change is yours and mine
And it all seems cleaner in the rain
And it all begins to look the same

Now the laughter turns to tears
Now the seconds seem like years
Oh but I'm still holding on
Driving through the tears

Only one world we've been given
Earth - wind - sea - air
We're burning holes into the morning sky
And we have learned not to care
And it all seems cleaner in the rain
And it all begins to look the same

Now the laughter turns to tears
Now the minutes seem like years
But I'm still holding on
Driving through the tears

And it all seems cleaner in the rain
And it all begins to look the same
Now the laughter turns to tears
Now the days seem like years
I hear the gods begin to cheer
As we watch our sky disappear

This is my Exodus
This is my Wire
Send it to those who care
I'm still holding on ",Wire,1995
The Nixons,"I would fly away
I would fly to heaven
Tip toe in the back 
If I knew where it was at

I could smile this way
I could smile forever
Vision in my mind
A place that has no time

Come take me there
While the world is laughing, it looks so sad
Come take us there
And I'll show you what its like
Make it rain

I could smell this way
Could go on forever
I'll never clean myself
You can all go straight to hell

[Chorus]
Come take me there
While the world is burning, it barely turns
Come take us there
And I'll show you what its like

Make it rain, make it rain forever
Make it rain, and I'll stay for dinner
What are we having tonight?

When I close my eyes, I can see forever
Never be myself, I could never be anybody else

Make it rain, make it rain forever

The Nixons,"Here I am again,
Overwhelming feelings
A thousand miles away
From your ocean home
Part of me is near

Thoughts of what we were invade
The miles that stand between
We can't separate
Your all I hoped you'd become

Sister I see you
Dancing on the stage
Of memory
Sister I miss you

Fleeting visits pass
Still they satisfy
Reminders of the next
Overshadow goodbye
Our flames burn as one

Sister I see you
Dancing on the stage
Of memory
Sister I miss you

All I am begins with you
Thoughts of hope understood
Half of me breathes in you
Thoughts of love remain true

Here we are again saying goodbye
Still we fall asleep underneath the same sky
You're all I knew you'd become

Sister I see you
Dancing on the stage
Of memory
Sister I miss you

Entwined, you and I
Our souls speak from across the miles
Intertwined, you and I
Our blood flows from the same inside
Half of me, breathes in you
Thoughts of love remain true

I see you, I feel you
When I close my eyes
I see walking there...
I see you dancing in my mind",Sister,1996

How far away are you slipping

And I couldn't break the darkness
Even staring at the sun

You walk with angels until you need to sin
You only think about me never
You keep your promise maybe for a day
You swore it only would get better

Can we take this track

There was a time that I felt I had guide
But I'm needing a revelation
I've been spit out and spit on

She continued the wanting, the needing, never quite receiving
Inside of her shell she kept her emotion
She could only imagine the feelings but never quite reach them
And she lies as she leads you away
And she smiles as she fades away

Despite all her burns she went straight to the fire
And the flame took the skin from the bone 
And the bone from the heart and the soul
If I could find a way to relieve all the hurting
I'd take all of the joy from the sky and put it back where it belongs
And she lies if she says she's okay

Down a pathway through an open gate

There the truth is so hard to say
Still it chills my heart

There's something I should keep for my own
I couldn't tell you everything
Got secrets that you wouldn't want to know

It's only dark
I'm freezing

And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see
Then she turned away and said,
""Once I loved, but love is dead""
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

She said, ""I cannot cry
And I cannot give or feel or even try""
And her voice was hard and cold
Then her sweet young face looked old
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

Through the endless days and nights
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)
Through the endless days and nights
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow
Love was sleeping, sleeping

She looked at me
And her smiling tears were warm and sweet and free
And the moonlight kissed her eyes
As it mingled with our sighs
And she whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

Since I can't have you
I will never fall in love again

I wrote this song and I'm a man
That was raised so tenderly
By folks that taught me good from bad
Well I've seen what I've seen
Worked out what it means
And I will never fall in love again

I've lost my youth I can't hide
This fact I know so well
Places that I've seen so many times
Seem so strange everything's changed
I will never fall in love again

I will never fall in love again
This time I speak the truth
A broken heart is hard to bear
I will conclude
Since I can't have you
I will never fall in love again",Never Fall in Love Again,2007

Is to silence the song
That seduces you
Why?
'cause you need that desire in your heart to survive
And you need that burning fire in your soul to know 
You're still alive
So catch me when I fall
Or did I dive at your delight?

In my heart I can fly
And I cannot disguise my love
There is no time
And I wouldn't know how
Constellations tonight
Are so fiercesomely bright, my love
I have no fear
I am Atticus now

Remember what I lost like hot coals in my hand from days gone by
Like Pandora adored the euphoria as her heart raced
Like love lost you've got to try even in vain
Feels like you'll go insane
But you're the hardest instrument that I've ever had to play

In my heart I can fly
And I cannot disguise my love
There is no time to

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful girl to 
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now
Here she comes

Doesn't look a thing like she does,
But she talks like a gentle soul,
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain
I don't know,
Higher now than ever before.
I know we can make it if we take it slow,
Let's take it easy,
And watch it roll.

We're burning down the highway skyline,
On the back of a hurricane, 
That started turnin',
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young
Back when you were young.

It ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a while. Hey!

Every once in a while.
Woo.

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful girl to 
To save you from your old bad ways
Pray forgiveness, boy.
Watch it now
Here she comes

And I don't look a thing like she does, 
But I talk like a gentle soul,
More than you ever know.

I'll never look a thing like she does, but I,
Talk like a gentle soul,

And release the highs, just let them fly
While I say whassup to grandma, in the sky

I'm chillin' in the studio, listenin' to Ace
About platinum hits, and how high to climb
And how many MC's really can't rhyme
But I get a dime for the wax I press
It's all a mind state that leads to stress
Them evil spirits, but I can't hear it
Like my girl Giant told me said you got to clear it
So I release and find my peace

When MC's blow up, and they get large
And forget, basin they styles on a hit

With acts like Green and my man Superb
Where rhymin' is first and the fame is third
So I walk around town with the full cassette

I feel about three inches tall
I wish I could crawl back under the covers

Would my heart be right with you?

More than just this song and dance
But that's all you saw to begin with
So that's what I gave you at last

I'm empty as a desert well
But I built the walls of this mirrored cell
It was a spiraled game of show and tell
And you beat me every time

And asks, ""Hey sir, what can I get for you today?""
I try to be polite and make nice conversation but
The foods no good she doesn't seem to even notice me here

Her shoulders slumped, I see her tear stained eyes
Head back through the double swinging doors
Serving pies was not her goal in life
I leave a tip like I think Jesus would and smile

Thanks a lot, have a nice day
And I'm on my way
Jesus what would You do?
Can You teach me how to love like You? ohh

I wanna give You everything
But I've got nothing of my own at all
And if I give what I have not got
Will You fill me up and make me whole, yeah

I see him sitting by the side
Of the building near the street sign
He's got a sign saying, ""I will work for food""
He looks up with his glazed over eyes says

""How 'bout a dollar for a veteran, a fellow American?""
Empty stomach, empty mind, empty soul
Have I got the time to feed him a little broken bread? No
Do I toss up a prayer as I walk on by or give him a tract?

And a weak fake smile
Or do I take the time to show him a little love?
Don't feel like I've got anything to give
So I guess, I've got nothing to lose, yeah, e, yeah

I wanna give You everything
But I've got nothing of my own at all
And if I give what I have not got
Will You fill me up and make me whole?

I come back a couple weeks later
See the same apron, same stains
Same splint end hair pulled back
She comes near and says

Hey mister, your smile picked me up
The other day, just thought I'd say thanks
Well, I don't know why it takes
All my effort to try, yeah, e, yeah

Looking in their eyes

And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking

Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing

And I sent you away, oh Mandy

Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin
thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't want to see me stackin G's
They after a playa but I won't let em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine 
I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down the four-five beware of stangers 
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me 
before the penitentiary

I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!"" 
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps 
and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody want to see 
but them youth don't trouble we 
because they fall victim to what they see hey!

And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight

We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't living so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause GED wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20 down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York

I had the master plan, I'm in the Caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TEC's to take over this projects
They call him Two-TEC's, he tote two TEC's
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon' to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally lounging, black
Sitting back, counting double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch, swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble

Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mould her now
Trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges, seeing syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, bagging five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, mothafucka

Want to get they little brother to wet me up

Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus

Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?""

She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)

Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping

Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

'Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit

And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight

The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down

50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat

And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course

The Notorious B.I.G.,"So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin', maybe I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggas know, that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggas sayin', ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks is
Natural to eat you niggas like chocolates

All I want is bitches, big booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches
From stayin' in my business, what is this? 
Relentless approach, to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfuckin' meet again
Huh, I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin' helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
What's love got to do
When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin' by the tons
Niggas wanna know, how I live the mack life
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Yo let—let—let me ask you a question yo
Yo, would you kill for me?
Hmmm, yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch

Yeah, just me and my bitch

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin' gats, in a Coach bag steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

So when did you first start rappin'?
Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18
So how did you first get started? Who influenced you?
Ain’t nobody really influenced me, you know what I’m saying? 
I was just tired of being on the streets, you know what I’m saying? 
Had to get up off that, you know
I see. So where you from?

Mm you actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit you fucked her every time you see her
You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you, ""why the fuck Big don't want me?""

Yo Big this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night, that's my best friend and we don't get down like that

Yeah motherfucker this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me, you be disappearing and shit, and I'm waiting in the cold

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila

Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick

I get swift with the lyrical gift

So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit

A big black motherfucker with G

Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let’s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex, and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing, they know Big be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast you, but I have to, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fucking polka dots

Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A, don't fuck with B-I, that's that
Oh I, thought he was wack. Oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now, hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented, car weed scented

Bite my tongue for no-one

Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga, Pop, from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me 'cause now I'm warning you
I got the MAC, nigga tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the Black Talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'ma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming

(C'mon motherfucker) I'm only comin' to pass the gat
(Just bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on)
Are we gettin' close, huh?
(It's right over here)
Are you sure this Biggie Smalls crib man?
(Yeah I'm sure motherfucker, c'mon!)
Ahh fuck, it better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck right here
This better be this motherfucker's house

The Notorious B.I.G.,"I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, ""What you talkin' bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...

T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
And it goes a little something like this

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in ICU
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my MAC unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
I make it hot (niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)

Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Get a hold of yourself, nigga!)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder, if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Yo, I'm on my way over there, man)

Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Yo, I'ma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga, Pop, from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me 'cause now I'm warning you
I got the MAC, nigga tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the Black Talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'ma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming

Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you to be happy
You to have the best of things
To be down with me, baby
'Cause your lovin', it's so good

You're giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down

She's fillin' your head with he said, she said
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran
Y'all stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals
I made you, why would I play you?
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home

You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things

Yo, would you kill for me?
Hmmm, yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin' gats, in a Coach bag steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, uh, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch

Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18

I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or white-skinned or black, baby I drop

Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia

Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed

Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex, and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo

The 2-for-5 dollar hits, the blue tops
Gotta go, Coolio mean it's getting ""Too Hot""
If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two Pacs
Get it? Tu-pac's

Time to separate the pros from the cons
The platinum from the bronze
That butter soft shit from that leather on the Fonz
A S1 diamond from a I class don
A Chandon sipper from a Rosé nigga, huh?!

Cristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather
The M.A.F.I.A. keep cannons in they Marc Buchanans
Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow, tossing ya
Mad slugs through your Nautica, I'm warning ya

I, Poppa, freaks all the honies
Dummies, playboy bunnies, those wantin' money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nothin'
But penetration, unless it smell like sanitation
Garbage I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Gucci down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi
Girls peep peep when they see me
Navajos creep me in they tepee
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet
Stop it, if you think your gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns get it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya
I'm clockin' ya, Versace shade watchin' ya
Once ya grin, I'm in game, begin
First I talk about how I dresses this
In diamond necklaces, stretch Lexus's
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper, help ya reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
Now sing the break

Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan
Schemin'
Don't leave ya girl 'round me
True player for real ask Puff Daddy (yeah)
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, payin' car notes
While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke?
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nuttin' left to do but send her home to you
I'm through can ya sing the song for me, boo?

I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know
Give me one more chance
(One more chance)
I got the good love, girl, ya didn't know

So, what's it gonna be, him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crush linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp; I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion, flyin' into all states
Sexin' me while ya man masturbates

Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewind

You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed

Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit

Scalin' fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' ya heat in the passenger seat

But I can and I will doe, I probably chill doe
Even though situation lookin kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase

Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, ""Don't blast here's the stash,
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!""

My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it

Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall

This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, day dreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be more gone than freemen
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screw faces, when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (What)
To old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what) specialize
In killin' wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, these Cristal chips
Bought to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit

That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall

That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray for my downfall

We used to hold the gold, now we floss with diamonds
Niggaz want my team to stop shinin'
Pray my fame start declinin'
Windin' like girlies
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
In moonlights, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start (What)
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp A La Carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eatin' clams and mussels
Octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack you
Give her a package to push, 'cause I work dem hoes
Pendejos, I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mill' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Today's agenda
Got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges
To leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killin's clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies
Kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo' life is on the shelf
We mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit' put bombs in yo' moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby
They shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies
That all out
I got gats that blow the wall out
Clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout
Word is Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me
Fuckin' real
Here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, 14-5 a piece
Enough to cop six, by the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps
Brick a piece
Capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream
No one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1 point 5
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life
Frank pay attention
These muthafuckas is henchmen
Renegades, if you die they still get paid
Extra probably, fuck a robbery
I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook
We can both pull burners, make the muthafuckin' beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin'
My life in that man hands, while he jus' decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol

Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on
Mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, caught a jooks
Heard it was sweet, 'bout 350 a piece
Ron bought a truck, 2 bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's the raw vantage, came back, speakin' spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, 20 carats
Here's a criminal
Nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby's mother's brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast, weeded
Took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated
He mean it
Nothing To Lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything, the game, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
'Specially if my daughter cryin', I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the signs

Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook
We can both pull burners, make the muthafuckin' beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin'
My life in that man hands, while he jus' decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol

We agreed to go and shootin' silly
Because niggas could be hidin' in showers with Mac Billy's
So I freaked 'em
The telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in '91, stole a gun from her workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blaze they place, long story
Glo' seen my face, got shook
Thought a nigga was comin' for the safe
Now she breakin', shut up, 112, what's shakin'
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear
They look gay
In a black Range Rover
Been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't leave
Ron, get the gasoline
This spot, we 'bout to blow
Let's get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats know
It's room 112
Right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline
The nigga pass me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flammable
My hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two
Opposite sexes
One black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin' patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin'
I saw her brains hit the floor
Ron laughin'
I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least 12 times in the chest
Spint around, shot the chick in the breast
She cryin', headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin' but Franco faces
The spots hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin'
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin', pistol grippin'
I know they clippin'
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us
I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it
Through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant

And taped up his wife

Wet em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4, I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7, this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10, a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up

But tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed

Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore

Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, enough money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us

Or our drop Mercedes

Now, what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers? Shot-callers? Brawlers?
Who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah livin' the raw deal 
Three course meals spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros, over in Rio Dijanery
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word
Swimmin' in women wit' they own condominiums
Five plus Fives, who drive Millineums
It's all about the Benjamins, what?
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what 
(I wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga)

Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Willona
From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringin', gondolas with the man singin'
Italian music down the river with your chick clingin'

Wanna bumble with the Bee, huh?
Bzzz, throw a hex on the whole family
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Have your friends singin', ""this is for my homie""
And you know me from makin' niggas so sick
Floss in my Six, with the 'Lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines
Get your own shit, why you ridin' mine?
I'm a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380's in Mercedes, Puffy, hold me down, baby!
Only female in my crew and I kick shit like a nigga do
Pull the trigger too, fuck you (uh, uh, uh)

I been had skills, Cristal spill
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me
In my asshole, undercover, Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (uh-huh)
My West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that for life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
Better now than never, business before pleasure
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?

Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
So when you hear somethin' make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
Our music keeps you movin' what are you provin'?
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'm a make you love me baby
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nothin' but choked
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And B.I.G. you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a win cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uh) you rakin' up plaques

In The Commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin' I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin' your fam' destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Crystal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The girl-boy killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two Midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placin' them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P.Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Uh, check it out, uh
I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!
Fuck all that pretty shit
Takin' it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggas know the deal
Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop?  Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin' for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin' through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin' of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, one seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin', I'm clappin' your way

Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental

Wanna be ballers? Shot-callers? Brawlers?
Who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah livin' the raw deal, three course meals spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros, over in Rio Dijanery
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word
Swimmin' in women wit' they own condominiums
Five plus Fives, who drive Millineums
It's all about the Benjamins, what?
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what (I wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga)

Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Willona
From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown
Pinkie ringin', gondolas with the man singin'

If it's murder, you know she wrote it
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated

Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me

In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed ""thug life"" and emptied the clip

Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school new school need to learn though
I burn baby burn like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho potato
Niggas know, the lyrics molestin' is takin' place
Fuckin' with B.I.G. it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on the masses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I'm Crooklyn's finest
You rewind this, Bad Boy's behind this

I seen the light excite all the freaks
Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back
Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings
Hammer cock, in the fire position and

Get live motherfuckers
Ready to Die motherfuckers

Come here, come here
Open your fucking mouth, open your, didn't I tell you don't fuck with me? Huh?
Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me?
Huh? Look at you now
Huh? 
Can't talk with a gun in your mouth huh?

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Venue after venue, I've been through
Come up to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex' door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'ma roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Rosé
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes
Get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke la
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming ""Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance""

These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen Bitch means number one and two
Wifey, y'all ain't got to like me
Go 'head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
You don't wanna play around (with me)
Hunnies just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together
And that we gonna have a kid together
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house

Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose

My son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap, he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying

We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that

He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating

And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music

I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous

The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave",Ms. Wallace (Outro),1999
The Notorious B.I.G.,"The motherfucker was amped
Nigga was motherfuckin' hyped up
The nigga just grabbed a nigga,snuffed a nigga
And it was on from there, the motherfucker, was not stopping him homes
(What the rest of his niggas do?)
Man, them motherfuckers was ready for anything
Them niggas was packing burners, niggas ready to fight with them
Whatever they had to do homes
Niggas on the real flip mode holmes
Niggas coming out like a motherfucker
Niggas was ancy like come on, come on, motherfuckers

Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Ay yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock
I'ma tell them, ""It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit""
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

I got seven MAC-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga
