Public Enemy,"She wants a lover right now
But not no brother
Her man gotta have a lotta money
To get under her cover
Now she's a fine sister
But up here she's missin' it
She says she want to learn about life
No old black bull shit
At the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby
She's 19 now and it drover her crazy
And now every time
She turns around
All the people in the neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing

Meet Mr. successful
I guess he's blessed yeah
But he happens to be a brother
Who only wants blue eyes and blond hair
Now this young mister
He don't like sisters
He couldn't find that special one
He know why he missed her
He says sisters wasn't good enuff
They only wanted his green stuff
That's why everytime he turned
Around all the people
In the neighborhood
Looked and got mad
And sang

I try to tell my people
There should not be any hatred
For a brother or a sister
Whose opposite race they've mated
No man is God
And God put us all here (yeah)
But this system has no wisdom
The devil split us in pairs
And taught us White is good, Black is bad
And Black and White is still too bad
That's why every time I turn around
All the people in my neighborhood
Look mad and sing",Pollywanacraka,1990
Public Enemy,"And you thought the beat slowed down
Power to the people
Get on up, get into it, get involved
Feel the bass as the cut revolves
To the brothers wit the eight oh eight
Like I said before PE got a brand new funk
Turn it up, boom the trunk, yeah
Internationally known on the microphone
Makin' sure the brothers will never leave you alone
To my sisters
Sisters yes we missed ya
Let's get it together make a nation
You can bet on it, don't sleep on it
'Cause the troops cold jeepin' it pumpin'
(Power to the people)
Turn us loose we shall overcome
They say where you get that bass from
Hey oh people, people as we continue on
Come along, sings this song, are you ready for '91
Rhythm nation pump that bass an
We like to know from Chicago, New York and LA
Are y'all ready, cause the plans in the jam
And we're ready to roll yo y'all got to tell me
Are y'all read read to go c'mon
(Power to the people)
Had to kick it like that as we roll as one
One under the sun, to all the cities and the side
Stateside and the whole wide
There it is
P-e-a-c-e 1991",Power to the People,1990
Public Enemy,"I never tried to pretend to have an
Accent that I never had
So why don't you stay away awhile
Come hear the freestyle
The quicker the sticks
With the guitar licks
Complete the beat for your feet
Check out the drum kick
I'm here to live for the love of my people
Kickin' it all about rebuildin' so all the children
Avoid the self destruction
So long I'm gonna do y'all a favor
Cause I got the flavor yea
Get low not high you can't deny
Homeboys and girls you'll testify
The p-e-f-you-n and the K will stay
And make your body sway cause we got
The funky beat on the street on your feet
Can you feel the heat in your mind all the time
You don't have to find the effect of the
Rhythm an the funky rhyme on your body
On your gear so have no fear in your hair
Everywhere if you dare take this never
Miss that funky list of super rockin' cuts
That you can't resist on the move make ya
Groove prove that we choose our cuts
Make you strut and shake your but
Bend your back get the knack of the
Funk attack
Yes, yes y'all take that",Reggie Jax,1990
Public Enemy,"I get down to what it is
And if it ain't funky (see ya)
People askin' me what's goin' on
With my mind
(Huh) wait a minute

It's just a matter of race
Cause a black male's in their face
Step back for the new jack swing
On the platter scatter huh
We got our own thing
Just jam to let the rhythm run
Day to day, America eats it's young
And defeats our women
There is a gap so wide we all can swim in
Drown in (uh get down) an get it
Got it goin' on wit it
Sister (hey) soul sister
We goin' be all right
It takes a man to take a stand
Understand it takes a
Woman to make a stronger man
(As we both get strong)
They'll call me a crazy Asiatic
While I'm singin' a song
Oh my god, oh my lord

I can't hold back
But I get exact on a track
It's an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Forget about me
Just set my sister free
R-e-s-p-e-c-t my sisters, not my enemy
(Cause we'll be stronger together)
And make the suckers say
(Damn) this generation

They don't know what we got goin' is (sound)
To turn it all around
To my sisters I communicate
With the bass and tone
through speakers and the microphone
Cause I'm tired of America dissin' my sisters
(For example, like they dissed Tawana)
And they try to say she's a liar
My people don't believe it
But even now they're getting higher
Of the feeling inspiration
We must know that in this nation
Every single generation
(They teach us how to dis our sisters)
strange as you say, I say revolution
Need for change brings on revolution
The great book just look see solution

God chooses who and what for the bruisin'
There's been no justice for none
Of my sisters
Just us been the ones that's been missin' her
Now we got to protect
We get together and damn this generation

I said so to what it is
Where it is
She needs a lil' respect
There it is
I say she needs a lotta
Brother from a mother like me has gotta
Give it up
Give it now
And pass it all around
To my soul (sister)

They disrespected mama and treated her like dirt
America took her, reshaped her, raped her
Nope, it never made the paper
Beat us, mated us
Made us attack our woman in black
So I said sophisticated B, don't be one
Not to head the warning crack of dawn
Or is it the dawn of crack?
Stop the talk they say, but
We talk and say what's right or wrong
Some say we wasting time singin' a song
But why is it that we're many different shades
Black woman's privacy invaded years and years
You cannot count my mama's tears
It's not the past but the future's
What she fears
Strong we be strong
The next generation
It's what not who we are facin'
The fingers pointed to us in our direction
The blind state of mind needs correction
Word to the mother we tighten connection
To be a man you need no election
This generation generates a new attitude
Sister to you we should not be rude
So we come together
And make 'em all say
Damn this generation",Revolutionary Generation,1990
Public Enemy,"War at 33 1/3
Haven't you heard
I got quick and clever
At the level of a scientist
With this list my fist pumps chumps
And don't miss
Sorry majority grudgin' against the enemy
And any other nigga wit an attitude see
And any other rapper whose a brother
Who try to speak to one another
Gets smothered by the other kind
No so divine so I heard it through the grapevine
Sent the feds out to get mine
Time yo-yo to go Bronco in 90-91
Laughin' while they're searchin' for my 98

Accelerate the race from the chase
Looka my face
It ain't hate but they don't want a debate
To take great
Can I live my life without 'em treatin'
Every brother like me like we're holdin'
A knife alright time to smack Uncle Sam
Don't give a damn, look at the flag
My bloods a flood
Without credit
Black and close to the edit
I fed it, you read it, just remember who said it
War at 33 1/3 not really live
I rather do it at 45
Went west in the quest for my intelligence
Climbed a fence took a teacher on
Ain't seen him since, hence he winced
And convinced that the Black
Was back revolving to a renaissance
Bronze to gold I told felt bold
Taught a so called teacher our role
In civilizin' the whole globe
Banned unplanned as I said
I don't break down religion why?
There ain't a smidgen for a pigeon
Nature for bird, dog, worm or lion
So my question to man is
So why the lyin'
God's law I saw is natural factual
Only man creates a waste
Defiance in his haste
Based on scheme a scam
From some mastermind damn if we read it
And we see it and still be blind
No need to search a fake church
Evangelical, huster
Anglo taxin' to muscle ya
Check I wreck you guess yes
All the bullshit now that's progress",War at 33 1/3,1990
Public Enemy,"I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sack and jack
Then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like me go solo
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm living, forgiven
What I'm giving up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and
Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Changing some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got better get some
(Get on up) hustler of culture
Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone
But
Welcome to the Terrordome",Welcome to the Terrordome,1990
Public Enemy,"Once again, this is it
Turn it up
Here we go
But this time the rhyme
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty
Like I want to know who
Picked Wilson's pocket
Afth, he rocket it
Fact, he shocked it
Same kinna thing they threw at James
An what did to Redd was a shame
The the Black get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that booty
Intentional rape system, like we ain't
Payed enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them
I learned we earned, got no concern
Instead we burned so where the hell is our return?
Plain and simp the system's a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho
Who stole the soul?

Ain't, no, different
Than in South Africa
Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo they say the Black don't know how to act
'Cause we're waitin' for the big payback
But we know it'll never come
That's why I say come and get some
Why when the Black move it, Jack move out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Ain't we all people?
How the hell can a color be no good for a neighborhood
Help, straighten me out
'Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
They I'm wrong for singin' a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
And try to be the best and 
Let everybody know before I blow
For the sake of what's right
I want to know who stole the soul?

We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented bye those who never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But that's all right
I try do what a brother does
But I'll never know if you're my 'cause
That's why I try my best to unite
And damn the rest if they don't like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
Forty acres and a mule Jack
Where is it why'd you try to fool the Black
It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance
To the red, white, and blue

As a matter of fact, it’s safe to say that they would rather switch than fight

To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange
People, people we are the same
No we're not the same

The future of Public Enemy gotta",Fight the Power,1990
Public Enemy,"Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer, where you never been I'm in
You want stylin', you know it's time again
D the enemy, tellin' you to hear it
They praised the music, this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, the show
Bum rush the sound I made a year ago
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
Not a sabbatical, yes to make it critical
The only part your body should be parting to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

Radio, suckers never play me
On the mix, just O.K. me
Now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known
Snakin' and takin' everything that a brother owns
Hard, my calling card
Recorded and orderd, supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud kickin' live next poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
Flavor, a rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime

Terminator X

From a rebel it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll comin' like a rhino
Tables turn, suckers burn to learn
They can't dis-able the power of my label
Def Jam, tells you who I am
The enemy's public, they really give a damn
Strong Island, where I got 'em wild and
That's the reason they're claimin' that I'm violent
Never silent, no dope gettin' dumb nope
Claimin' where we get our rhythm from
Number one, we hit ya and we give ya some
No gun, and still never on the run
You want to be an S.1, Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come, you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president, pullin' out the ray-gun
Zap the next one, I could be you're Sho-gun
Suckers, don't last a minute
Soft and smooth, I ain't with it
Hardcore, rawbone like a razor
I'm like a lazer, I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya, so this will faze ya
Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya
Playin' the role I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
Smooth, no what I am
Rough, 'cause I'm the man

No matter what the name, we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
Yeah, the voice of power
Is in the house, go take a shower boy
P.E. a group, a crew, not singular
We were black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers
You can't angle us, I know you're listenin'
I caught you pissin' in you're pants
You're scared of us dissin' us
The crowd is missin' us
We're on a mission boy

Terminator X

Attitude, when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose, electric wire
Simple and plain, give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
See the car keys, you'll never get these
They belong to the 98 posse
You want some more son, you want to get some
Rush the door on a store, pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed

What the fuck is you drinkin'
He don't know but it flow
Out the bottle in a cup
He call it gettin' fucked up
Like we ain't fucked up already
See the man they call Crazy Eddie
Liquor man with the bottle in his hand
He give the liquor man ten to begin
Wit' no change and he run
To get his brains rearranged
Serve it to the home they're able
To do without a table
Beside what's inside ain't on the label
They drink it thinkin' it's good
But they don't sell the shit in the white neighborhood
Exposin' the plan they get mad at me I understand
They're slaves to the liquor man
Back to my homeboy shorty
He can drink it down
And think nothin' about it
Pass it around and get tha forty dog buzz
At the same time
Shorty can't remember what day it was
Say I'm yellin' is fact
Genocide kickin' in yo back
How many times have you seen
A black fight a black
After drinkin' down a bottle
Or a malt liquor six-pack
Malt liquor bull
What it is is bullshit Colt

Who's sellin' us pain
In the hood another up to no good
Plan that's designed by the other man
But who drink it like water
One and on till the stores reorder it
Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it
Sippin' it lick drink it down oh no
Drinkin' poison but they don't know

Death row what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The incredible D. Public Enemy number one
Five-O said ""Freeze!"" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
'Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do""

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music
That the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers
And sisters now across the country has us up for the war

We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio Stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B, and L.L. as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to pleed the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue

Took a toll

There gonna be a day

In da neighborhood
But we spendin' money

To no end lookin' for a friend
In a war to the core
Rippin' up the poor in da stores
Till they get a brother

Kickin' down doors
Then I figure I kick it bigger
Look 'em dead in the eye
And they wince

Defense is pressurized
They don't want it to be

In disguise so give some money back

""A player, that can leap, with the best of them""

Risin up in the 'Velt, Strong Island, New York
The hood in case you did not know my base
There was a ballplayer who had all the skills
Wit the pill to pay the piper, plus all the bills
Mick his first name, Mack the awesome game
Practiced in the heat, in the rain or in pain
Mick so quick, at six foot six
Down to be picked by anyone but the Celtics
Oh what a handle could score from the floor
With people bangin on him, or even hangin on him
But what he did best, above all the rest was...

""A player that can leap, with the best of them""
""As a high school standout...""
""The skywalker himself!""
""I felt, he could do, to make this an effective basketball team""

Grades nine and ten, Mickey Mack was all that
But in class his ass sat way in the back
How I know, cause I know, I used to flow wit the bro
He didn't mind I used to read him his own headline
Cause he could not read em his school wouldn't need em
If the lines wouldn'ta went like this
Mickey Mack jumped over the candlestick
His stack was his stats but his D was still wack
Grades eleven and twelve he found the wrong clientele and all
During class, he would dribble in the hall
But never got in trouble in school, but the trouble was
It was cool if your brain was just another bubble
As long as he could score fiddy-two
Get thirty-three rebounds, fuckin around
Temas lost to him he went right through em
Division, county, state, that's three count em
Championships for a small town bro
That's bound to go pro

""He gets free, turn on the jumper, good!""
""Streak of lightning when he breaks loose...""
""We all felt in our hearts we could win this ballgame""
""They just required me to have the game that I did
 I'm just... that's all I that's all I that's all I can say""
""That's all I can say""
""He hauled down fifteeen rebounds, and kept the ball away from everybody""
""Then he had a triple double!""
""A-a-a sensational player...""

SAT's didn't matter cause he was all that
You know the pat on the back
He was always in the news you gotta know what it means
It means revenue, and I'm tellin you
I saw cars and G's come to our school please
Approach Hell with the principal, where's the coach
Went to college four years wit a scholarship...
...and won the championship
But when it came to his life he didn't care...
...cause he took it to the air

""Cross and a hook, he scores, he's fouled!""
""From the far corner, breaks West and here's the jumper, good!!""
""There's the jumper, it's not gonna go, rebound batted back...""

[Chuck D] Air

The fall began when Mickey Mack fell
Hell ripped his kneee drafted last by personnel
Oh how he loved the game, it was fantastic
Until he was cut, and couldn't stick
Times got tighter and tighter
He had an attitude was rude, so he turned into a fighter
School wouldn't give him the job that he needed
Assistant to the assistant coach, they didn't need it
Then he resorted to a stick up kid
Ski-mask and gat, but this game he wasn't good at
And the drugs on the side
Police ambushed his ride another homicide
He was over, ghost why'know
Hometown hero, but now a zero
To those hypocrites who ripped him blind
For his skills without the will to develop his mind
Forever in the news the community views him
Only as Air Hoodlum

        People
        But our color had 'em playin' us out
        Like we was Cinderella
        But if you take it & break it down
        Full of noise but Jack & his boys
        Keep doin' what they want to do
        But hear me out
        Jack goes under color
        To kill one another
        'Cause some blacks act devil too
        And if you see him
        You can tell by his act
        Not his word but his deed
        And we bleed all because of that
        Lifestyle of a dirty rat
        And if you act like that
        Step back & hit the road Jack

        Not Jack the Ripper
        Or the jack of spades
        I'm not jackin' for beats
        Let's get Jack the raper
        Mothers cried while forefathers died
        From the whip
        And not a bit ever made the paper
        When I come they all
        Run & hide
        And they quit
        And yell loud
        Here he come wit' dat black s--t
        I'm through wit Jack
        Bein' the quarterback of the scene
        He's played out like bell-bottom jeans
        I took a line from the Main Source

Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack

Our status is the saddest
So I care where you at, black
And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin' my telephone
I never live alone
I never walk alone
My posses always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone
Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be knowin' the scheme that of the president
Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doing harm
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
C'mon c'mon louder

I am the rock hard trooper
To the bone, the bone, the bone
Full grown, consider me, stone
Once again and
I say it for you to know
The troop is always ready, I yell 'geronimo'
Your CIA, you see I ain't kiddin'
Both King and X they got ridda' both
A story untold, true, but unknown
Professor Griff knows,
""I ain't no toast""
And not the braggin' or boastin' and plus
It ain't no secret why they're tappin' my phone, although
I can't keep it a secret
So I decided to kick it, yo
And yes it weighs a ton
I say it once again
I'm called the enemy, I'll never be a friend
Of those with closed minds, don't know I'm rapid
The way that I rap it
Is makin' 'em tap it, yeah
Never servin 'em well, 'cause I'm an un-Tom
It's no secret at all
Cause I'm louder than a bomb

Cold holdin' the load
The burden breakin' the mold
I ain't lyin' denyin', 'cause they're checkin' my code
Am I buggin' 'cause they're buggin' my phone, for information
No tellin' who's sellin' out, power buildin' the nation so,
Joinin' the set, the point blank target
Every brothers inside, so least not, you forget, no
Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong
Just a bit of advice, 'cause we be payin' the price
'Cause every brother mans life
Is like swingin' the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is
The brother to brother
The Terminator, the cutter

Goin' on an' on, leave alone the grown
Get it straight in '88, an' I'll troop it to demonstrate
The posse always ready, 98 at 98
My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity
Tappin' my phone, they never leave me alone
I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb

'Cause the D is for dangerous
You can come and get some of this
I teach and speak
So when its spoke, it's no joke
The voice of choice
The place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble
The rhythm is the rebel
Here's a funky rhyme that they're tappin' on
Just thinkin' I'm breakin' the beats I'm rappin' on

A mass murder in mass from a blanket full o' smallpox
No guarantees, gettin' lesser fees
Tuskegee had us go out with disease

Please check da time, c'mon, check da rhyme
Tribe o' mine, killed by da swine
Who crossed da line? Who did da crime?
The mind of a world, destroyin' kind

We're runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time

A lil' piece of my mind while we runnin' outta time
People of color goin' out like no other kind
Mad drama, genetic gettin' wreck
Protect ya' neck, check the epidemic

Drug use, addiction an' murder, I heard a pregnancy
Infant mortality, rest in poverty not peace
Disease 'til deceased, sterilized, realized
That beast, so here's a word to the wise

They got us runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus

I rather sing, bring, think reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover

Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river

Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'

Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit satan?
I rope a dope the evil with righteous
Bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even
Come on down
But welcome to the Terrordome.

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bendin' 'em

Snakes blowin' up the lines of design
Tryin' to blind the science I'm sendin' 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide

But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother

'Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcom X the man
The shootin' of Huey Newton
From a hand of a nigga who pulled the trigger

It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst

Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
An example of one of many cases

The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'

But it's on bass and drums even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of gettin' physically sweaty
When I get mad

I put it down on a pad
Give ya somethin' that cha never had.. controllin'
Fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'

Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team

Never move alone

Only 5 percent of the biz

I'm addin' woes
That's how da way it goes
Then you think I rank never drank, point blank
I own loans

Suckers got me runnin' from the bank

Kickin' down doors
Then I figure I kick it bigger
Look 'em dead in the eye
And they wince

Roamin' through Hollywood late at night

Pulled to the curb gettin' played like a sucker
Don't fight the power  the mother fucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood boulevard
Thinin' how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portrayin' the roles
Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
Many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
When on the screen
Like a guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And black women in this profession
As for playin' a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like spike lee

I ainâ??t even gotta ask it
As whoâ??s underpaid and
Fouled at the basket
I canâ??t blame the envy
At who gettin the benjis

From behind crazies flippin' through the faces.

Back to Brooklyn
Even in Spain they knew flavor's name
In japan they know I'm nice in the game

Spread the cash cleaned trash

And not the paper chases
People all over the world given mad respect
When I identified who the Government wrecked

Ask the company rep
They don't care
They just about keepin' their checks

Where the worlds headed nobody knows

Can the real lyric fix the shit that the time forgot
Loops gotcha brain gettin' locked
Loaded up with words that never meant a lot
And you can't call the cops
And y'all don't really know
And y'all don't hear me through
Takes a nation of big brains
To break up that flow
And the game ain't changed
But the heads be rearranged

Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do""
Follow for now, power to the people say,
""Make a miracle. D, pump the lyrical""
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across the country has us up for the war

We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric be, and L.L. as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight

Now I got some new cats 
Hearin' me
That never heard me
Eleven thirty do the math
Damn, here come the draft
But I'm at an age my fightin' is half ass
Shee, my flags always at half mast
Need you ask
While some of y'all laugh
But I see war lining these young cats
Up for body bags
And these so called thugs masquerading in drag
Cause now the feds checkin' all dem head rags
Hopin' this gung ho thing last
Cold and dark is the weather
Peoples, get yor sh*t together

Ain't even gonna fix my mouth to say chickens
Told y'all in terror dome the clocks tickin'
From all sides come the wicked
Governments
Fundamentalists
But how you gonna
Kill the innocent?
Between terrorists 
And CIA hit lists
Like my man uno says
Beware the false prophets
Gotta be smarter than this
They say war is a profit
With loved ones missed
But death is a debt
None of us ain't seen war yet
Be careful what you ask for
War is hell and hell is war
All them bling bling thangs throw em in the river
All that thugged out sh*t y'all cant deliver
Seen four planes kill everyday folks
Guess 911 ain't no joke
Wall street cryin' broke
Was it god
Or the devil itself
Who spoke?
Old vampires
Hit the new empire
Had the sky cookin'
Brooklyn had no other choice 
But to stare and keep lookin'
City smile
Missin' two front teeth
While some of y'all 
Still talkin' them little ass beefs
Over who, what SoundScanned

This month you sound scared
Guessin' where the party at?
While downtowns wonderin'
Where the bodies at?

How you sell soul to a souless people
Who sold their soul?
Keep the people from bein' sheeple
Followin'
Hollow voices
To tommorrow's sorrow
Women have nurtured
And birthed the earth
Man has killed many
For land and worse
Women got a cycle that's spoken for
Man has a period, its called war
May the power go to
Everyday people
May war have no sequel, live 
Reverse the word you get evil
Cause people wanna live against evil
Avoid the third world war
Biological bombs
A hundred times worse than Vietnam
So what you gonna do?
If you was on that plane 
Both sides would've killed you too

I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and
Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Changing some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got better get some

Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone

I'm such a lover of people
Because people did so much for me
I'm a lover of all humanity, all man kind
And I feel that he who has been successful
Should look out of for his fellow man, his brother
I feel that's my role, that's my job
I know when I was a kid
You see I was gonna be a preacher, huh, ay
Maybe I am, but to me, I feel like I'm a teacher, somewhat
'Cause I've been able to experience things that most, poor
Or a lot of people haven't been able to, even the rich
So I'll start by preaching right here
'Cause I want to preach to you one more time about heroin
I talked once before, now I want to preach
I want to start by saying
I heared heroin talking one more time and said
From where I came, nobody knows
I come from a land where the poppy seed grows
A whole nation gathered to plot my destruction
Because I'm a breeder of crime and wholesale corruption
You say, I'm pure and then undiluatable
And once I'm in your blood I make it pursuitable
Now only they say sing it on son
Sing it on son, she says I've lost my son, he's gone away
Sing it on son, you might save a life
I said madam, I say lookie here
I say, on a record and make all men
That date to use it will wallow in sin
Driven then to commit a world of crime
Captive their will and destroy their mind
They changed their lives and destroyed the meek
Misurer of fools and made the strong men weak
I know, wait a minute, lookie here
They take gold from the rich and made them poor
Take young foolish maden and made her a whore
Look at that
And then I heared about that time
I heard a man over in the corner
He was sitting down with his head hanging low
I noticed him when he first walked in
And he was addicted to drugs but he said I feel it
And brother I want to get up and testify
So everybody started screaming and hollering and crying
I saw a little tear coming from my eye 'cause I know I felt it
And this brother got up and said let me have it
I want to tell you everything
Talk to a man that knows
He said some will sell me and some will buy
For a state of affection and they 'cause high
But regardless of the position, reason of use
You control my addition and I give nothing but abuse
He said let me tell you about heroin
With a full cause of torment
For it's pleasures and pain
It will take all of your money and poison your brain
Lord, I started singing, I said mmmm
The place started rocking to kinda rocking a little bit
I heard someone tapping their foot and they sing on brother
I started humming a little in the back ground
And then that brother said wait a minute
He said, beware of the sharp needle brother, it'll make you sick
Annoyed, anguished, and won't let you kick
It'll make you hustle, steal, borrow and beg
I'm still talking about that bad thing, king heroin
When you want to look for a vein in your arm or your leg
I felt so bad I didn't know what to do
He said, more priceless than diamond, more treasured than gold
More important than whiskey more deadly than wine
It'll just give you discomfort and no piece of mind
And when you come out the nod, he said you'll always be aware
You've shot every drop of your heart and it's full of fear
Now you must rush out and hit another sting

Public Enemy,"Today we are together, we are unified and on runnin' cower
When we are together we got power
That is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own

We spit flows on foes 
Listen to the message that you never know 
Got a plan for the man and it's federal 
The rhyme animal, back to play the part again 
Clear the madness, and put the message in 
D, the enemy is back to rip the mic 
We come together, so don't believe the hype 
Check my tone, there's a war here at home 
We united and strong, and never move alone 

We rep justice, equality and freedom now 
Put fam first, man, woman and child 
Never mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise 
Where we say, what we mean and we mean what we say 
It's been a long time comin' that we mob as one 
Guerrilla funk, hard truth nigga, that's what's up 
No peace on the street 'til the justice come 
From the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on 

[Chorus]
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
See, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Believe, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
That's real talk on the one 

Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a target, I got proof
My buildin' got an 'x' on it 
Bloomberg threw the hex on it
It's like a pistol with effects on it 
On a nigga with arrest warrants 
Hittin' pigs in their chests quadrant where they vest wasn't 
Now he dead cousin 
All you snitches hit the red buttons, we some uncle-tom killers 
Mini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom for rilla 

Yo, if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees 
I ain't got no 'g' to give it to them crackers and court fees 
You know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst 
Never caught slippin' if you stay on alert 
Malcolm x said send them to the cemetery if they touch you 
A revolutionary virtue, a dull blade'll hurt you 
I'm up early workin' my machete 
In war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me

You see, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me, yeah, uha

Yeah, my nigga it's bigger than rap
You really think you gon' be left alone 
On sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on? 
Then yap on, and will see if that's the right route 
While I get my clap on and turn niggas' lights out 
I tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed them 
I'm willin' to do a killin' for the price of freedom ""that's right""
comin' from the left, nigga, hood is how we kept it ""right""
So prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted 
So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk ""that's right""
This ain't the word of a fake, it's guerrilla funk 
So right now is the time and you turf the location 
Y'all about to see the rebirth of a nation 
Even if some got de-rebelized 
The revolution still will not be televised 
you.s. government tellin' hell of lies 
And it's evident, when you look in this president's devil eyes 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Yeah, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
No homie, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me

That's real talk on the one 

That is why, I challenged you now
To stand together, raise your fists together
And engage in our national black messiness
Do it courage and determination

Public Enemy,"Yo Chuck, bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio, ya know what I'm sayin'
And this brother stop me and aks me
""Yo wassup with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice""
I said, ""Yo the brother don't swear he nice
He knows he's nice, ya know what I'm sayin' ""

So Chuck, we got a feelin'
You turn him into a Public Enemy man
Now remember that line you was kickin' to me
On the way out to L.A., out in Queens
While we was in the car on our way to the Shot
Well, yo right now kick the bass for them brothers
And let them know, what goes on, what goes on

Well, I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
1, 2, 3 down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt

Cold rock rap, 49er supreme
Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team
'Cause I can can go solo, like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all

Suckers, ducks, ho, hum MC's
You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, 110 degrees
So don't start bassin' I'll start placin'
Bets on that you'll be disgracin'

You and your mind from a beatin' from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one, one

You got no rap, but you want to battle
It's like havin' a boat, but you got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws

Written while sittin', all fittin' not bitten
Givin' me the juice that your not gettin'
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a nonstop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer

I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a Bible start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied

You just got caught a, for going out of order
And now you're servin' football teams their water
You messed with the master, word to Chuck
And I'll wax cold tax, made sure you got dunked

You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck MC's, you get me pissed
It's no fun, being on the run
Because they got me, Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one

Don't you know, don't you know
I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out, we got never the match
Ambush attack on my back, double teamin', get creamed
So we have us so you're okay?

Wanna hear it again
We got a force, enemy down
The L.I. circuit sound
Ain't it Chuckie D, myself and KG
Flavor, DJ Melody

Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes, that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But it's also the words from our direction, a gold boy session
Kickin' like Bruce Lee's Chinese connection

On stereo, never ever mind, no
All wax, yes I'm talkin' about vinyl
They said stop freeze, I got froze up
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one

For all you suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You're grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, I heard she fixes old dryers

You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell ya equipment, but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew, is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic political lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one

Yeah, that's right Chuck man
That's what you gotta do
You gotta tell them just like that
Ya know what I'm sayin'

'Cause yo man, let me tell you a little somethin' man
These brothers runnin' around, hard headed
Makin' a little jealous, ya know what I'm sayin'
Just like that, ya know, they try to bring you down with 'em

But yo Chuck, you gotta let 'em know who's who in the world of beat
You gotta let 'em know that this is the 80's
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes

And that's the way the story goes
That's just the way the story goes
So let me tell you a little somethin' man

Right

You spend a buck in the 80's, whatcha you get is a preacher
Forgivin' this torture of the system that brought cha
I'm on a mission and you got that right
Addin' fuel to the fire, punch to the fight

Many have forgotten what we came here for
Never knew or had a clue so you're on the floor
Just growin', not knowin' about your past
Now you're lookin' pretty stupid while you're shakin' your ass

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

Some people fear me when I talk this way
Some come near me, some run away
Some people take heed to every word I say
Some wanna build a posse, some stay away

Some people think that we plan to fail
Wonder why we go under or we go to jail
Some ask us why we act the way we act
Without lookin' how long they kept us back

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

Yes, you if I bore you, I won't ignore you
I'm sayin' things that they say I'm not supposed to
Give you pride that you may not find
If you're blind about your past then I'll point behind

Kings, queens, warriors, lovers
People, proud sisters and brothers
Their biggest fear, suckers get tears
When we can top their best idea

Our solution, mind revolution
Can't sell it, no, you can't buy it in a potion
You lie about the life that you wanted to try
Tellin' me about a head you decided to fly

Another brother with the same woes that you face
But you shot with the same hands, you fall from grace
Every brother should be every brother's keeper
But you shot with your left while your right was on your beeper

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

As the world turns, it's a terrible waste
To see the stupid look stuck on your face
Time bomb alarm for the world, just try it
Known to all zones as the one man riot

I'm on a mission to set you straight
Children it's not too late
Explain to the world when it's plain to see
To be what the world doesn't want us to be

Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
Platinum gold a house and a car
But poverty all around you by far
People living under bridges or in a car
Heaven for the super rich who call it modern living
But the Man from the east calls it a wilderness
Cause heaven for whites is hell for blacks in america
Heaven and hell are two conditions of Life
Not a place up there or a place down there
It's a condition of life on earth so value Life
Heaven is not things
It's a higher level of thinking
And at the moment one may change the conditions of Life
Our people think a job, partying and endless flow of women and moet,
Krystal and how much sex you can have is heaven
Sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time
But being able to meet Life's struggles head on, head on, head on
Without compromising your Soul soul soul soul
In this worlds Life
Not Life after death
Life on earth
Life
Not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children
Sit yourself in heaven at once
A woman is a very important part of heaven
She produces heaven with you
And if she is connected to the source of Life
So heaven is a condition of Life
And you can have it on earth
SO VALUE LIFE
VALUE LIFE
Who in the hell told y'all you were in heaven
Oh, Oh

But try to do the right thing
If its the right thing
Then go on 
Do the damn thing

Treat me like a king
Lemme hear you sing

Money cant buy you love
Thought you knew that
Eight days a week
Livin' like a rugrat

Gettin' wreck gonna break it down the record now
Gotta break it down
Rhymin' this flow on the go
C'mon get it now

Yeah 
I'm saying we went from gods to niggas
From queens to bitches
Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
Platinum gold a house and a car
But poverty all around you by far
People living under bridges or in a car
Heaven for the super rich who call it modern living
But the man from the east calls it a wilderness
Cause heaven for whites is hell for blacks in america
Heaven and hell are two conditions of life
Not a place up there or a place down there
It's a condition of life on earth so value life
Heaven is not things
It's a higher level of thinking
And at the moment one may change the conditions of life
Our people think a job, partying and endless flow of women and moet,
Krystal and how much sex you can have is heaven
Sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time
But being able to meet life's struggles head on, head on, head on
Without compromising your soul soul soul soul
In this worlds life
Not life after death
Life on earth
Life
Not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children
Sit yourself in heaven at once
A woman is a very important part of heaven
She produces heaven with you
And if she is connected to the source of life
So heaven is a condition of life
And you can have it on earth
So value life
Value life
Who in the hell told y'all you were in heaven

Public Enemy,"We was raised in these streets on pork and poison meat
Now I recognize the beast and bare the mark of the gold teeth 
Puff on the rolled leaf and bust on the police
While y'all playas are fakin bacon we cook the whole beef.
I put it down plain, I stimulate the left and right brain
Cell by cell and frame by frame.
Names, dates, are all inmaterial.

Give me two thousand live people

Ain't no equal in the flesh
I been through more evil than men do.
Nasty off the head and with the pen too!

Easy to rhyme on tracks like this
The more things change
The more they remain the same

In pursuit of plain Jane

Some of these cats don't know how to act
All them criminal acts ain't got nothin' to do with rap

Of society to society
Together we got 100 years of sobriety

Cold delivering pain

Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard

Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb

Never move alone

Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
1-2-3 down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap - 49er supreme
Is what I choose and I use - I never lose to a team
'Cause I can can go solo, like a Sugar Ray bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut some cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, 110 degrees
So don't start bassin' cause I'll start placin'
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and you mind from a beatin' from my rhymes
A time, a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

You got no rap, but you want a battle
It's like havin' a boat, but you got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws
Written while sittin', all fittin' not bitten
Givin' me the juice that your not gettin'
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible so start your prayer
A word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught a, for going out of order
And now you're servin' football teams their water
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees, you get me pissed
It's no fun, being on the run
'Cause they got me, Public Enemy number one

For all you suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
You crossed up wires are always starting fires
For you grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, I heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell ya equipment, but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew, is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic lyrical son

Public Enemy,"I came from a place I forgot
I woke up in the parking lot, far from a meal and a cot
On the corner where all the streets got the same name
Maybe my brain's on the brink of (insane!)
Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train
This the land of milk and honey (know what I'm sayin'?!)
The invisible man times three
Black, down and out, out standin' on a corner (no doubt)
Now a nation of homeless sleepin' in bus stations
Another win for the pilgrims who said (no more Haitians)

Callin' young folks a bunch a no-good rejects

An eye for an eye, I can't recognize the man in the mirror
Is it I? It is I
Now who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been waitin' so long, to get where I'm goin'
An eye for a eye, in this country 'tis of thee
Now how the hell, can I be free
And who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been lost so long without anybody knowin'

So I move on (uh-huh) and I walk on (yeah yeah!)
Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on (say word?!)
Why do home gotta be where the negative roam
To be or not to be (so I roll alone)
I'm trapped within, this skin and these bones
Amongst temporary kings, on cellular phones
Can I last, as I walk past
Mad cigarette billboards, and malt liquor ads
(Walkin' on da bottles and potato chip bags)
Everyone I see got the nerve to brag
Where they from, what they got, and don't own squat
Disrespect where they from and you might get shot
Zombies askin' me, what the latest bomb be
(You shoulda shot the fuckin' sheriff and the fuckin' deputy G!)
For okayin' the drug trade and lettin' it be
But I know prison for me, is an industry
So I walk, heard the best things in life be free
(Didn't God make this land and the air that we breathe)
Not for the homeless, don't give a damn about me
In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me
Maybe prison is the skin I'm within
All this time I been sufferin' can't fix it with a Bufferin'
Plus they said I'll never work in this town again (God damn!) 
So I keep on walkin', yeah

Lil' DayDay is Big Day and just did time

No more welfare, they cut her Medicaid
(Damn! My momma used to do her braids)
I keep walkin, so they don't see me
But I doubt if they doin' much better than me
So I walk on, never take the planet for granted
I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite
I walked past three brothers, sittin on the porch
With a yard of dirt, and littered with Newports
Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on they ass
As I walk past 'em I'm the target of they laughs
And one said ""Let's get him for his fuckin' stash""
As I walked fast, past the other yards with grass
Had a little cash, I tried to make it last
From a few deals I made from cleanin' windshields

It's important that you knowin' the time
Cause I'm seein' the program, know what I know and
Until we get together we will never be up for sure
So I wreck like I'm posessed by Malcolm X
See the feds want us dead, we too complex
I always speak the truth, comin' from me to you
We movin' as a unit so you know we refuse to lose
I got my eyes on the lies from Washington
I'm a survivor, I know how the West was won
See a show and tell, the way the CoIntel
Undermine the real hip-hop so the cops can trail
But know bad boys move in silence
Save us all from the pain of a life of violence
They tappin my phone, full grown and knowin'
And still prone to refute the lies, won't stop until we rise

Rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon""
Rise rise up! ""One more time""
We rise rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon""
Rise rise up! ""To the beat y'all""

I'm a hard truth soldier to the bone for change
Demonstrate and separate the fact from strange
Blame companies killin' our children
When the villain's on the record 
Never think for a second that's the way we live
Wanna squeeze on the fleas at MTV
We quiz knots for the cops at BET
Seize the time, always rhymin' combinin' the antidote
For dope Interscope and fake gangster quotes
Cause I can recollect times when records set
Collect a dead brother you mind if you silence it yet
Rest the program, defeat the beastie
Cause on the street they do as we influenced by what we see
And yes it ""Weighs a Ton"" I say it once again
That's why the Enemy is down with Paris and KAM

I know the power of fame, ain't never playin' no games
Never croonin' is provin', that we ready for change
Never simpin' but they pimpin' my people, for the dollars
So I holla back it keep us from evil 'til them devils are collared
And like I said it's on, I say it once again
Better know the plan to keep us ignorant
Brother to brother, ain't no other can smother
Or erase my case, we marry words with bass
Just another wicked rhyme that I'm rappin' on
S1's got my back if the clappin' come
Pass on the work, makin' sure the words are known
Keep 'em nervous, make 'em understand we servin' foes
Keep it goin' strong, nevertheless, know the enemy
And never back down, you can take it to press
'Less the mic like the art dart told you before
We for the prize emphasis the fight, now c'mon and rise

Beat is for Yoko Ono

Public Enemy,"[Chorus]
It might feel good 
It might sound a little somethin' 
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin' 
What is game who got game 
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game 
I got game 
She's got game 
We got game 
They got game 
He got game 
It might feel good 
Or sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin' 

If man is the father the son is the center of the earth 
In the middle of the universe 
Then why is this verse coming six times rehearsed 
I don't freestyle much but write 'em like such (word) 
Amongst times controlled by the screen 
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seeing 
Human beings screaming vocal javelins 
Sign of the local nigga unraveling 
My wonderin' got ass wonderin' 
Where Christ is in all this crisis 
Hating Satan never knew what nice is 
Check the paper while I bet on ices 
Keep more than your eye can see and ears can hear 
Year by year all the sense disappears 
Nonsense preserves prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two triple o is near 

There is something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Tellin' me I got to beware 
It's time to stop children what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Thought of that millennium just be killing them 
It scary like lies buried in a library 
When did state pen correct anything 
When piles of us still be catchin' the bus 
When stacks of cash packed in laundromats 
Pay the preachers back where the teachers at 
I ain't even gotta ask it 
Whose underpaid and got fouled at the basket 
I can't blame the envy at who be getting all the benjis 
And taking them grants for granted 
Last I checked pyramids wasn't built like projects 
On them government checks 
Modern day thugs ain't got no guts 
Pardon the expression under governor nuts 
Last time in a church be the last time in a church 
Dead pledge allegiance to CD's and movies 
Leaving reality believing in fantasy 
Bleeding fatalities too many formalities 
Prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two trip zero is here

Is it any wonder
What kind of ground you goin' under

To march madness remember?
You never heard a murder
Take for example
Unsolved mystery
Life lost in a funk sample
Enter the bandwagons
Braggin' hangin' banners
Clearin' the way for younger MC's
And new hammers
What was criticized six years back
Is now back
With New York on the jersey front and back
Feel like Tiger Woods
Got mad goods
Way up from the cheap seats
Comin' outta the hood
Race to the black seats
Amongst the wack seats
Be the hardcore
Alongside the deadbeats
The world lookin' on
Like spectators
At crucified gladiators
Feels like a jungle inside
Where fish swim birds fly
Man got a tendency to die
Man falls to the hands of man
But damn if I'll ever try
To survive at court side
Four tickets to fly

Or duck the drive by

Be the same ones that do us in

By the mark of the beast
Raised by peeps rode jeeps
Deep in Brooklyn beats
Praised as a hero

Public Enemy,"Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy Number One
Five-O said, ""Freeze!"" and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I never really had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said, ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you wanna do is follow for now""
Power of the people, say
""Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical""
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside 
Music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters 
Mow, cause the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

Turn it up! Bring the noise!

He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

From coast to coast, so you can stop being like a comatose
""Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast toast""
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight

Who pose as heroes and take advantage of blacks
Your government's gangster, so cut the crap
A war going on so where y'all at?

'F the Police' but who's stopping you from killing me?
Disaster, fiascos over a loop by P.E

Wit slavery, lynching, and them drugs infiltrated
I'm like that doll Chucky, baby
Keep comin' back to live love life like I'm crazy
Keep it movin' risin' to the top

Thank you for lettin' us be ourselves
So don't mind me if I repeat myself
These simple lines be good for your health

Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,

But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,

Help me

Lord can you help me get this weight off my shoulders
Can you help me I think I'm getting older
The pain that you left me deep within
How can I live living in sin

And you know that I've tried
And you know
Lord knows I've tried every day of my life
Sitting at the bottom, sitting at the bottom with you
Sitting at the bottom with you
I'm just sitting at the bottom with you
I'm just sitting at the bottom, sitting at the bottom

How many times I gotta say
That you're never ever gonna get your way
Down in the gutter as I decay
Where you gonna leave me
Let me be
Help me
Help me
Help me
Help me understand

And you know that I've tried
Don't you know
Lord knows I've tried every day of my life
Sitting at the bottom, I'm sitting at the bottom with you
I'm just sitting at the bottom with you
Now I'm sitting at the bottom with you
I'm just sitting at the bottom, sitting at the bottom with you

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me

Sticks and stones breaking my bones
No your words aren't never gonna hurt me

""I'm so sure"", what a snotty thing to say
Stuck up people always get their way
They think they're so cool
These are the kind of people that you drool over
That is because they don't really care 
Except about their finger nails and their long pretty hair

And I'll bet they'll turn their back on you and say ""I'm so sure""

I don't wanna be like you [Repeat: x 3]

Puff,"[Z-Ro]
I'm sick of being lied to, giving it my all, you know I tried to
Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to
Do anything for my peeps
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay
In the mean time they hate you everyday
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off
When three's company and four is a crowd
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it
Got you looking at your people meaning shit
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit

[Chorus - 2x]
Take a look at my life, everybody around here so shife
No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right

[Z-Ro]
Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night
Give me a split that's what I'm asking
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love

[Mr. 3-2]
It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages
Stacking big faces and travel to many places
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon 
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight
It's whenever when we were boss want to do
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through

[Chorus - 2x]
[H2O]
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes
I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit

[Z-Ro]
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at

It's the god of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin' airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus

I had a whole lotta bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you
She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman loving a rich man
Now here you come, drop top riding
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lying
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you cause you couldn't be, like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature, and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too Short

Crazy ass man
I never would of bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm thirty years old nigga
And that bitch was hoeing when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fucking witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga
She ain't nothing but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife fool
Every time you turn your back that bitch is fucking with them gangstas
Eastside Westside these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talking bout nigga

How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)

But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin' up at high noon
Sayin', ""Why me Lord?"" folks thinkin' I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin', but when they sleepin'
I be concealed up in my room, knowin' that it could happen
I'm just tryin' to maintin', because the future is untold
Till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin' after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin' for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'

Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin' for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin' through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin' of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, one seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin', I'm clappin' your way

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective
What? From a, from a young G's perspective

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive

Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Eh eh
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing
You don't really wanna stop
Eh eh

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job
Everybody eatin, everybody involved
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand
All we wanna do is make you dance
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Chorus

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough
Fuck Domino's, strictly dice
Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggaz shit on E, what a pi-ty
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies
Drive a Ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone
Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home
On the six-four, sittin on chrome
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Everything we make is hot

If you said in your last time, ?
And thought he saw the devil, Jay kissed his feet
You think not, as if
Sheek won't bring it to you, give you asthma's
Is he rocking cashmere? Y'all
know we don't pass there
Matter fact, I scoped out there last year
Hit him on the head said there ain't no cash there
Stay home, Styles about to hit Tony Rhomes
Puff out his own with this chick from Rome
? funny how I'm greedy, used to be needy
But now the Sean-Don keep the ?

every chick want my baby
My career clear while your shit look hazy
Bang with us? I don't think so, we platinum plus
With no airplay so ain't shit for us to discuss
But when we hit, you can't understand how we did it
At home practicing trying to learn how we spit it
Fourty-eight hours of old tea like Nick Nolte
Young but O-G's at this rap shit nigga please
One hit for all of us to start eating
And wild stack on three weeks
on bowell leather beats
Our parents are sharp like cactus's
And you can tell by chips, we sleep on mattresses
Dimes flooded out in the hideous
Shit you see in magazines, cut
out we freak them hoes
Drop them clothes, double expose you in the lens
Now relax as we videotape you in the bed

I turn down is my collar
Pull out turn them around, if he
reach make him holler

Puff is the godfather, dog, so why bother?
With the third-person, you might catch me surfing
Money I be jerkin, my newborn be burping
Can't stop, won't stop, I want respect
And I only bum heads with checks
In the suite with this honey from Bangladesh
Pop a snapple, I ? lay on my chest
All I had to do was get it there, she doing the rest
Take a L to the head, then we listen to flex
Yes, the black hood, and I mack good
With hydro and chocolate mixed in backwood
Ask yourself, do you rap good or act good?
Baby we ain't gon' stop, but you should

But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
so now my sight is gettin dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
but wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax

Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed

Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile

I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'

Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun 
Cause they got me public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
You know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because i'm public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? and thats just the way the story goes
And thats just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

You think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?

Puff Daddy,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

I met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then
Talkin' that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggas baggin' joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't nothin' shook
About them, I doubt them cats waitin' for me
You know them niggas, them big dudes across the street
She say, ""Yeah, they from over on Mayfair""
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out
This bitch over them with them pointin' the chief out
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, I'ma show 'em how Black play
Roll the dice, fuckin' with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto

Seein' honey at the club e'ry week and I speak
I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin' honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
You's about to get, fucked with no jail

Fill one of they chests with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in
In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin'
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over

When night falls - that's when it all begins
Be prepared; we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend y'all bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm like I'm nervous
Live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Start'n conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in their black magic
Suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready?  Don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti

Leave all the does behind that act iffy

Till the other side retreats

I told you that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill 
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till it's done
See, I got guns, and I'm sick
See how you said meet me here, and I came quick?
Them same cats on the most wanted list
We can hit them, then straight disappear in the mist
...Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill, and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile; break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening, and, but now I'm alert

Gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat

I lay mousetraps for those mice-house niggas that house gats
They want to out me

I mean I'm just limpin', 'cause right now I see the profit
Show me some grams; I chop it
Show me some land; I cop it
Show me some ho somewhere in the tropics
And I'm a suck the p**** till she beg me to stop it
That's real; I'm a tell you how the black man feel
Pack toast but still catch him with the backhand steel
Pimp status, while you run around with shrimp status
Got a gat and decided to clap at least twenty right at us

But unfortunately it's that war outside
And I still roll with bulletproof doors on my ride

Might have to check a few cats for good measure

It's hectic so I send Black to come and check it
Ain't s*** changed; same s*** stains in the business
Approach me; play me closely; hopin' hopefully (keep hopin')

Ladies & gentlemen
You're about to witness something that you've never witnessed before
Sauce Money's in the house & he brought his man with him

I leave rap in a state of shock
Where to rock, from the figures still
Play the block with my niggas
Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush
Still stack chips galore
Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw
Better know that everything I love - roll back
Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew
Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga
You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'
I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother
Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker
My wrists cluster, on a mobile
P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop
Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques
I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga

Try to see if you see what I see
Give my game & spit my G
When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one
On top is where I be
Tell me, do you see what I see?
(When I look in your eyes, I see you hatin' inside, so tell me)
Do you see what I see?
(I know you're hopin' I'm blind, cause you don't want me to shine)

[Sauce Money]
No secret, undefeated, I'm top seeded
Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it
This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated
Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it
Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1
Niggas want to bite off my flow son
I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track
Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw
Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?
BK forever representin' my borough
Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips
Too easy for you to understand my hits
When the album drops every pocket hold some
Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son
Hypnotic, heard the ? war 'fore I shot it
Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it

I took rap by the throat & locked it
P-Diddy fixed all those who tried to stop it

[Sauce Money] (PD)
As a matter of fact, yo don't you hate that? (hate that)
Whenever cats playa hatin' from way back (way back)
Mad at you, just because they whack (they whack)
And I bought your style, older than 8-track (8-track)

Only way to react though
Make hot joints & stack dough
Laughin' at your whack flow
Try to catch my G
Just so you can rap like me
Act like me

Cats hate me cause I mastered this
PD the one who brought class to this
I brought a brand new 6 just to blast my disc
Pockets fool of chips with the glass on the wrist
Got a mashion in the Hamptons that niggas would kill for but I'm never 
really home I live on the billboards
Cause I remained da most famous Entertiner
Yacht by the dock jetplane in the hanger
Haters all hating and the ladies all waiting
That's how I stay winning
You the hottest in the nation
Getting my bounce on
Dipped in Sean John
Chilling in Justins and spilling the Sean Don
I roll in the Rolls on cruise-control
If you know what I know then you can go where I go
Got a whole a lot of dough and money in escrow
Having fun spending one's and watching my sons grow
Like my nigga Bust said Give Me Some Mo
We in the record store or you can catch us on tour
Bad Boy 99 goin shine once more
Making sure everybody know the time once more

Yo I want to live in the lap of lux with a maid who does windows, cooks, 
cleans, and fucks

wet my dick money

Puff Daddy,"Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me; this is what I am

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin' ""that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G
People warn me, when you're on top, there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now",Hate Me Now,1999

Puff Daddy,"Check this out, yeah yeah 

All my niggas, take a walk with me
You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be and how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga
I get money, I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit, I hit dimes, what I need with a nine
Before y'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware, we here
What's my name? Got chicks twisted, like, what's my game?
Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don't harass it
Ma, I'm a baller, I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came to do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through, come on

It's right around eleven o'clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook, y'all doing it heavy
She's telling you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning, it'll be fun
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got you
Me, I think you're running 'cause I'm the one
You see

I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party oh
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party

You're probably thinking to yourself, what's the occasion?
And believe me, girl, I don't do sex for fun
The perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you?

I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight

(La, la, la)
Ghetto girls (la, la, la)
Suburban girls (la, la, la)
International girls, you smell me? (la, la, la, la)

Had to take the time
To open up your mind
That's exactly what you are: open
You got the mesmerizing grind
Your shape should be a crime
Damn baby you're a star, you're smoking

You're probably thinking to yourself, what's the occasion?
And believe me, girl, I don't do sex for fun
The perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you?

I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight (what you came to do)

It's real serious
You're so fine, girl
At the end of the day, I'm going home with you

Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm fuckin with this chick,
with a phat body and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

Been in the game twelve years it ain't easy
Been in dem things got game that so breezy
Spendin' them things with a chain that's so freezy
Please believe me, TV need me
As far as the CD, pump that on GP
What's the 411 hun, it's PD
M-J-B collabo with B-B
Period, no question no comma
Your hearing is no vest and no armor
Bring it to cats like Bush to Osama
Sippin' on vu, make moves and no scama
Word to my mama
Can't deal with the trama
That why a nigga stay in the Bahamas
Laying in pajamas
Two sexy mamas
Bodyguards, topguns, two extra lamas
I don't want no drama

[Chorus: x2]

No more, no more, no more
No more drama y'all

Spit thug sound, why'all know how thugs sound
Can't touch clowns, slow slugs down

Since I'm a G, rep 3 'til I'm swazy
why'all cats fugazi, my shit's crazy

Game stayed on top of - Fame played a part of
Change, made a lot of - Flame in the hearts of
Men I'm a Made one - Friends, I don't need none
Play it by the rules, took some let some
Once was behind bars, now I'm a All Star
Outlaw to idol, takin all the titles
Whole family 'spect it, whole fam connected
Fuck off the hook, my shit's disconnected

Do shows outta town, bring dollars home
Spread love throughout my hood, my hood love me
Lemme give you some advice, don't never trust me
You gonna pay the price if you ever fuck me
It's like rollin dice, if you try an duff me

Hey , back on the scene
Ain't nuthin' changed
Still doin' wild things
Whippin' something mean
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans
The top story, evening news
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dogs ain't there

The more fame we get, niggas get concerned

Trying to get a little bit of stress off my brain

Arm freeze, mom please, ain't nothin' but cheese
Caribbean Sea, Malibu breeze
Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me
Pop bottles, models, be all on me
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be
Front on me and see where you all gon' be
Six feet deep
When the heat seek, niggas be misty
From 155th to 11Oth Street
Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?

[Chorus: x2]

[P. Diddy]
See this is the part I like right here
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor
Yeah, I see why y'all, just shakin' your asses
See man, hold on, I need to break it down
Yeah
One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?
Think Bad Boy been played a million times
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes
Damn, we still payed!

We still payed!
Yeah, we got it made!

[Loon]
Hey yo, this game ain't stoppin'
We champagne poppin'
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you goin' actually learn
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn
I stay on my J-O-be

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick
Named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers
To spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stopping this

And Ima make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon rock to this
Now say my name

Ay yo, I came in the door
I said it before
I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Make the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Cause I came too far
For me to be bouswar
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I'm trying to see you work it out girl
(La La La La La La La La La La La La)

Now hold up, stop, wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning
Got asian women
That'll change my linen
After I done blazed and hit em
But I just wanna rock wit you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo

Got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya

Tender, her whole body bend like fender

Nigga in the game got a little chain becuz
Heard the nigga signed a major budget
But I'm the nigga made you love
Now you want to change the subject
I ain't sweating that animosity

Instead of rap imma smack you dead in your trap

Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya?

Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture
If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace
Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused

Creep with your people
Though my shit is Sweet and Low it's no Equal
Front but you lookin
Once I throw the hook in proceed to get cookin
with the game when I sewed it
Since you came thought I owed you one
Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him
with my man's type proper
Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it
'fore we take off make sure you all seated

Put the high score up

On the world tour with your whore out in Europe
Head on the tour bus

Called up five reporters to thank my supporters
Hittin wives and daughters
Brought 'em neck spray from Estee Lauders
Call Puffy to order

Aiyyo, call me Diddy - I run this city
Send the cops, the D.A. and feds to come get me
Cats want to leave me for dead you comin with me
Gettin head in the Bentley red at one fifty
Straight lose it, love two things my family my music
Might co-write and produce it
Drop mine, hot 9 exclusive
Got y'all Hawkin like Yusef
Cause I can, break backs and stacks it's no problem
Make raps and tracks and go Harlem
I get worldwide coverage
Got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it
Make moves major, hide out in Asia
If your girl keep comin around them I'm a blaze her
I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators

How many niggaz done tried to play Rob, quit they day job
Tired of putting broke niggaz under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing
Act like you gon' pull that thing thing
You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent ""A"" block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen
Moves for paper, booze no chaser
Bullets out the blazer four-fifth with the laser

I want the whole stack
Plus I, need a little more, I gotta eat a little mo'
My seed gotta grow
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show
What I mean is I go
off like a champ, when I cling to the floor
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dipping
Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

why y'all niggas still talking?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

[G. Dep]
This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you living an illusion, living in a used one
while I'm in the Limited, cruising
You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said, I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

[Black Rob]
Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice

Yo these funny talking cats tryin' to do a nigga foul
It's goin' down nigga round up the team
I'm'll head over here just to map out the scene
Ship them things in route to climb walls
Infrared vision ear plugs and all

Hey yo we gotta get him

It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me I'm'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and

[Mark Curry]
Yo, uh uh uh, hello
It gotta be the same cats
I can tell by they strange acts
When they mumble to each other
Like Milan they run for cover
New 'cause this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is
I'm on it, act like they want it

Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

So watch what the fuck you say
It's ya mouth that started the shit
Now you actin' all retarted and shit
Dog I came to play my part and that's it
We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan
Call Sean tell Sean we gone
We'll meet him in Hong Kong
With two chicks both they thongs on
Mabe Ling and Kim Long
Both of them dead wrong
Two rich bitches the feds on

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, well it seems like brother Loon is out in Hong Kong
He's found his self in a sticky icky icky situation
But you know somethin' I have faith in the bad boys
Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

[Kain]
Heh, I'm bout to do Santa Dimengo
On a horse named Bingo
A fugitive lookin' for Puff switchin' my lingo
Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo
Callin' up MC from a cuatro cinco
The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots
Ha yeah!
Suited up ready to dumbs out
Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

Puff Daddy,"I know a honey named Millie, raised out in Philly
Body so illy she make a grown man silly
A brainiac really she pretend she dilly
Like, ""Why you always look at me like that, you feel me?""

There's a girl named Wendy, love black Bentley's
Nails in her mouth, stay tryin' to tempt me
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty

Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy
Let's just say she has a problem bein' choosy
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi
On the celly with her man, ""Love you, I'm at the movies""

Bird named Chyna (baby where you find her)
Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her
(On Amsterdam, lay in the lane, dippin' despite her)

[Chorus]
So after school, I take a dip in the pool
Which is really, on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see, the Knicks play basketball
And we talkin' bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money
Than a sucker, could ever spend
But I couldn't give a what about them cats you with
Get your friends baby, jump in the Benz

I got a judge named Donna, I call her Your Honor
Whylin' out with the gavel and the silk pajamas (let's go)

And then there's Tamika, the sergeant gets deeper
She turned the bass way up and wind on the speaker
Girl named Kelly, rhinestones in her belly
Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly
Game concealed, a female Machiavelli
Hopin and prayin that I ain't ready for the jelly

Can you feel it? nothin' can save ya

For making movies and the microphone
Cause we get crazy, I mean outrageous
You rollin' with us? 
You rollin' with flavor

Ask Penny, I call her Good'n'Plenty (why?)
Cause after the show, there's nothin' open but Denny's (oh yeah)
Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley

Little Shaniqua, from Massapequa
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her, anyway

You talk about careers that's hard to kill
The whole entire globe recognize the grill
Walkin down the red carpet we're chilly chill!

Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to St.Tropez?
Or seened a brotha play a Mandalay?
Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin', I love you girl

What I need, is a pretty woman next to me (Standin' next to me girl)
To share the dreams that I Believe (When I wake up in the morning)
Maybe we could start a family (I wanna see your pretty face, yeah)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need (Is that all you want?)
Is a pretty woman next to me (Made the sacrifice)
To share the dreams that I believe (And maybe maybe we)
Maybe we could start a family
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need, is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I Believe
Maybe we could start a family
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need","I Need a Girl, Pt. 2",2002
Puff Daddy,"When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean

Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines

Only siguar needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, Im loose with banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when i shoot the cannon
The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
I pull up in the black Lotus, you're plaque's are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls
You rackin' 'em up, Im big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up
In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Cadallacin' the truck

Puff Daddy,"I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word girl it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Winter time and the fall lives snow white
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I used to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife

I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas, Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad

But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened a lot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces

I need affection

Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!

Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever

Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to St.Tropez?
Or seened a brotha play a Mandalay?

No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin', I love you girl

More niggas to kill, than birds to bag

Could tell by your tone, you hate bein' home all alone

No fans hold hands on the beach witcha

On the real 'cause I feel so complete witcha

I remember what you said
When you said it to me last night
We was talkin' and you reassured me everything's fine
When I woke up this morning to get some lovin' from you
I turned to one side
To my surprise, I wasn't layin' next to you m'mm

Why did you get close to me
Thought it was supposed to be

Why you handelin' me this way
What was it you was talkin' yesterday
Yesterday, I could say, I seemed to be
So complete so complete

Went away you said nothing
You didn't no kiss no lovin'
You didn't it's a shame
But it brings about the weak in me
You didn't spend a lot of time with me
You didn't share things I wanna see
You didn't when ever you're around me it's so complete

So I waited and I waited
'cause I knew that you would call
Hours 1 hours 2 hours 3 hours not at all
If I'm dreamin' wake me up
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I cannot see how you would ever let this happen to me
Oow oow ooh

I still believe that it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
If you're sayin that you need to leave
Then be a man about it step to me
Step to me, tell me please
That without me it's so complete, so complete

Won't you tell me right now what you want from me
What you want from me
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby
Held it in
Thought you were the one but you just played me
You know you played me
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete
Yeah ho ho yeah yeah

Please, give me the response I need
I want you to complete me, ohh baby
Pleas, give me all the lovin I need

Went straight to the mizzel, tizzel (oh that's crazy)
I drove straight past my hizzel, dizzel (oh that's crazy)
It's a slizzel nizzel fa shizzel (oh that's crazy)

Puff Daddy,"I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word girl it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Winter time and the fall lives snow white
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I used to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man
I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

It was the summertime 
When we fell in love, it was the summertime 
Heaven shined on us; it was the summertime 
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime

Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old wit'cha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you
A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

Baby, you're more than just a man
You are my best friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then

Verse 1:
Before '99 I was born again
5 years later I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's an oxy moron
Forget a bus, I brought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin' I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gonna make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin'
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed...come on...yeah)

Verse 2:
Some days I make thousands
Some days I make millions
Spend my day chillin

Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot gray drop Maybach gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour
I had bling before you ever seen the tour
Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I...Know
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life
I've become a saved (Say what)
Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact
It's the kid resurrected it's a it's a wrap

Puff Daddy,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man
Word up

Move different, pools on the roof patroose sippin'
Made your life different, blink you might miss it

You're everything to me
You never left my side
You're my best friend
I love you so much
Yes, you are
You're my best friend

Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?

Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen

Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew

Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright

Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you

We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town

Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour

Looked me in the eyes and ask, ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out

Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him, ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said, ""Manifest the great""

All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on

Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on
I do, satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do

Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch was a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate theyy treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
""Am I good?"" he ask, thinkin', ""But is he testin' you?""

Make you pussy, make you snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

Ride with my niggas cause my niggas understand me
Still on Plan A, pussy niggas on Plan B
Right now, motherfucker let's go
Young rich nigga, young rich nigga

Yeah, what can make a nigga wanna go and get it?
Said he want a Beamer with the subs in it
Said he grew up in a house and it was love missing
Said he grew up in the set, he keep his guns with him
Young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, just a young nigga
And he don't need a reason, he a young nigga
And you don't want your daughter and your sons with him

When he pull up in a Phantom
He gon' have that shit blasting
Like young nigga, just a young nigga

What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number one, nigga
Looking at the legend I become, nigga
I can't help, but feeling like I'm the one, nigga
Remember I was on the run, nigga
Couple years before you had a son, nigga
Open up your doors and kept it one, nigga
Held a nigga down and that was love, nigga
Nobody want to stand in front a judge, nigga
Make you think of better days like when you was winning
Standing on the couches in the club with us
But then I got my shot, I had to run with it
Out the gate, lost count, many days in the studio, we slave, but this shit we gotta save
Staring in the space that you fishing for a phrase
Uninspired and your mind, still it's all a paper chase
First you over dedicate, then you notice that you great
And you been the whole time, then it slap you in the face
Then you stack it in your safe, got it cracking, it was fate
You the definition, nigga, laughing to the bank
I'm a master of my fate, plus I'm the type of nigga own the masters to my tape
I'm in Nevada for the day, I just caught a flight from Philly, we just sold out TLA
Fresh up off a stage on my way to B of A
AMB, we L.A, tryna eat, we the way
Look, young Nipsey, he the great, never talk
Had a drink, I just lead to the lake
It's eighty-something degrees in L.A
Fuck it, time to put some jetskis on L.A
Look, I got a team at my bank, I don't even need an I.D at my bank
This used to be a dream we would chase
I know J. Stone and Copy Supreme could relate
I know the whole team could relate
I know Evan Makenzi and Bron Lees could relate
Cornell, Saddam, Adam Man, DeBron, Steven Donaldson and Black Sam been on this Marathon
Balling since my brother used to hustle out the Vons
Couple hundred thousand up, he took a shovel to the lawn
No exaggeration for the content of my songs
When he went to dig it up, shit, a hundred something gone
Molded, you can ask moms
Had to plug in blow dryers for the ones we could wash
Salvaged the little bit
Young rich nigga shit, pressure on your shoulder
How you gon' deal with it?
Say it's all uncomfortable when you transition, but it's all beautiful when you get rich in it
When you start killing shit and they all witness
Money roll faster than niggas could spend the shit
Open more businesses with you and your niggas that watching your vision and being more generate
Like a Ford dealership, we up in Forbes
Watching and they wishing that it wasn't yours
I forgive you, I remember I was poor
Plus I ain't in the way of what you reaching for
Gotta play the game, you gotta read the score
See, I'ma do the same and pop the clutch of four
Told me if I want it, gotta hustle for it
Only difference now, the money more mature

Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack, write hot shit
And make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

Been around the world and I I I

I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes

I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way it's hot and hazy,
Never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's, nigga please,
I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come
Get 'em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, enough money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

Been around the world and I I I

When I feel, trapped
Feel there's, no way out
No escape
To be honest, I don't know where my life is goin
Where I'll end up at
I just don't know

I looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice
Stayed away from the bogus, til his rise began
Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest
til he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin
Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin
Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild
Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot
He dream, visualize, plot and scheme
Got the cream legally without the beam
Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0
Jet black tint still, they might know
Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&B
Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks
Heard she do backflips, for niggaz who stack chips
Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo
Real G's makin her back swell
Only givin head to those niggaz who rapped well
Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints
Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more
Two bagged up, four went raw
Back of my mind countin up the big score
Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor
Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore
So far from pure, rotten to the core
Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips
with cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold
to bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice
In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on
Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on
Don't understand they playin wit it
Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it
Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun
I'd release slugs black and bust back
See how these players love that, to the point where
I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it
I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself
And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

I been on this road for a long time now
At time it seems like the road is never gonna end
On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains
Peaks and valleys
Even a lot of potholes on this road
It's never smooth, on the road of life
I don't know where I'm going
I just know where I wanna end up at

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job
Everybody eatin, everybody involved
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand
All we wanna do is make you dance
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough
Fuck Domino's, strictly dice
Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggaz shit on E, what a pi-ty
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies
Drive a Ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone
Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home
On the six-four, sittin on chrome
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

You know the dress, that got the party impressed
You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine

I was cool with her pops Lou, the mechanic
Went to school with her brother, that's right
I never could build up the words to express how I loved her
Long hair, pretty face, slim waist
The kind that you marry and take to another place
And exchange vows, spend thous
Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel

Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin' after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin' for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop?  Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin' for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately cause now I, charter my own

Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin' through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin' of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, one seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it

I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight

Used to call my crib to see seventy-four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin' honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money

If you learn to listen you'll find
Love can last forever
If you are willing to give in
Baby that's the reason
You should start believing

You can run you can hide
Run into these arms of mine
I will help you understand the true meaning of love
You can laugh you can cry
And you know I'll be by your side
I will help you understand the true meaning of love

We can wish we can dream
Together we can do anything
I will help you understand the true meaning of love

I wonder how many times
Love calls our name
Will we answer do we walk away
Baby thats the question
Am asking you today

I will help you understand the true meaning of love
You can laugh you can cry
You know I will be by your side
I will help you understand the true meaning of love

Come a little closer
I will help you understand the true meaning of love
You can wish me anything
Baby together we can do anything
I will help you understand the true meaning of love

Puffy,"Everyday Everyday We not only get sick but get to hate it. 
Whether there is understanding or not, we continue for now we continue. 

Rain fell and washed away, The wind blew away.

The thing my tired body remembers, yesterday's conversation topic and last year's birthday.
Depending on a familiar picture from a magazine, we left with empty hands we left. 

Night painted out, Flowers bloomed and covered. 

It was as wide as I could see, look at that sky !
Connected to that neighboring land, look at that sea !
For now I've forgotten everything.
I haven't forgotten an honest heart. 

Rain and Wind, Night and Flower You supported me. 

Wherever I may go I bring the huge sun with me.
There are no nuisances to prevent my way. 
I knew I would forget everything. 
I faced tomorrow with my true heart
We swore to the sea and the blue sky.

It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule

Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness (Happiness)

Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)
You can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind

I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'
Feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind

Feels great
And no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive
Feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great",Shiawase (Happiness),2003

Puffy AmiYumi,"Everyday Everyday We not only get sick but get to hate it. 
Whether there is understanding or not, we continue for now we continue. 

Rain fell and washed away, The wind blew away.

The thing my tired body remembers, yesterday's conversation topic and last year's birthday.
Depending on a familiar picture from a magazine, we left with empty hands we left. 

Night painted out, Flowers bloomed and covered. 

It was as wide as I could see, look at that sky !
Connected to that neighboring land, look at that sea !
For now I've forgotten everything.
I haven't forgotten an honest heart. 

Rain and Wind, Night and Flower You supported me. 

Wherever I may go I bring the huge sun with me.
There are no nuisances to prevent my way. 
I knew I would forget everything. 
I faced tomorrow with my true heart
We swore to the sea and the blue sky.

Calling radio Tokyo

They're on their knees
Won't somebody please just bring them home

Pug Horton,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.
A cottage for sale.",A Cottage for Sale,1979
Pug Horton,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?

Pug Horton,"The night was filled with sweet surrender
I had a million things to say
We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?

Pug Horton,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,2015
