Bun B,"Wake up in the morning, roll a blunt and then I count bank
Pull out the garage, hit a button then the top faint
You ain't from the ""A"", all you really did was migrate
Asking me if I'm great, yeah bitch I'm great
Swerving down Peachtree, yeah bitch I'm straight
Every day my birthday, yeah bitch I get cake
You better get dough, ho you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter
Came up off Ball and G, growed up off Bun and C
Got me a Chevy swapped feet twice the same week
Shawty say she want me, shawty know I run things
We used to wear the mask like Friday the 1-3
Then I found out I had that pimp in my bloodstream
Got me one ho and then I got me a whole team
Had a starting five with a bench on the side
So for every bitch I got, she got a bitch on the side

Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter

Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter

I got money on my mind, I got cash up on my brain
I got green up in my eyes and I ain't finna pass it mane
Never let a penny pass, never let a dollar disappear
And if you don't understand me bitch I'll make it crystal clear
Coming down the Gulfway, passing by the Scale Co
Candy on the car, nigga pop my trunk they have no
Choice but to watch the neon lights with my name lit
Pimp a ho, stack the dough, yeah I'm on that same shit
Lames sit your ass up in the stands and eat a hot dog
This is for the big bosses boy and you are not hog
Never been a eagle man, I never seen you soar
Through the sky, looking super fly cause you paid off a whore
You're not a pimp, put that on Pimp, you a fraud
Buying pussy on the side instead of tryna break a broad
We don't do that over here, matter fact we never did
So keep your distance from the circle, we ain't with that tricking shit
Bitch

Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter

Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter

Your eyes wide open, scopin', ropin' hold that thoroughbred
Pussy wet like April shower, twerking power, thorough head
Get deep in the mind of a pro, take her where she never been but where she wanna go
Unless she in the comfort of a monster with a mouthpiece, then I reach her on stroll
Pimp shit get rich and quick, tell a bad bitch how I feel
Never laid back, gotta make a quota, if it ain't a high roller keep that pussy sealed
So motherfucker can you buy that? At the rhythm of a bass drum
Hit the club buy the bar like a star take that other nigga bitch like dare that nigga say something
I seen pimps and you ain't one, you're not close to me I'm everything a real nigga supposed to be
You act like you did everything you could, but she was supposed to leave
At her neck like rosaries if she ain't where she supposed to be, I put her on game
She devoted to the notion of roller coasters, and that won't change
With my trunk on bang, sun on shine, break a bitch down like a Garcia y Vega
Fill her up with the gumption to hit the ground running, and go and get me some gators
Yeah suits with the tailor, that fit the frame of a nigga all about his paper
Forever pimping, never slipping, forever recruiting these top notch hoes in the majors

Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter

Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter",Pimps,2014
Bun B,"I feel the blessing even when it's all disguised up
Even when the stress try to pile up
Paper in my hand give me wild rush
Reminiscing on wild us and rolling the miles up
So [?] I'm never putting the pound up
Let 'em hate, bitch, I built it from ground up
I hold the fort down, nigga, know what?
You could see it in the lives that my sound touched
I make money, take money, my aim hungry
Spit a verse, it ain't nothing short of a green [?]
Bucketlist complete, I did a song with Bun B
And Juicy J, who the fuck fucking with me?
I think nada, lame rappers you make me gog up
The part, depart these niggas like I'm shooting commas
State your business or forever hold your peace
Go 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet

Got damn, who would've thought it would've been me?
Street legend that came up with a pen, G
16 bars to get me out the ghetto
And I always kept it real with the people, I never settle
There's a lot of folks depending on me to lead 'em the right way
Instead of listening to what the radio might play
Some real game for somebody that did it
We be breaking it all the way down so anybody could get it
And I gotta admit it, the road was buffy
Hand-to-hand combats, sometimes I live lovely
You can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though
Just make sure when you on the side of right, bro
You don't go in thinking you making history
But looking back in retrospect it ain't no mystery
Nobody ain't ever did what we did then
And ain't nobody to do it again, nigga, we legendary

[Hook:]
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, nothing you can tell us
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, all we do is kill it

Whole life we grinding for the dough
And leave behind a legacy, the legend of it too
It's not an urban myth, no, we are the truth
If anybody gon' do it know we gon' do
Whole life we grind so hard to stay official
And make them niggas hating back [?] tissue
They shit you 'til they stomach, fuck 'em
I ain't never loved 'em
Peace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit
Peace to the youth, the young soldiers in the street
[?] to the money, they reminding me of me
When you get get that, better keep that, better not let that drop
Cause someone gon' be right there then take your spot
We got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked
My haters wanna be blasted, man, they better stop
For shit get good, you could see his guts
And it's too late to serve you, they can't get you mopped

You see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments
Yeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas
I could sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement
Nah, nigga, stay high and bitch I'm with is high maintance
Homie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on
We gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone
You don't got no hustle, you get cut off like coupons
Been about crutons, bro, that's why the roof gone
We still coming up, that's what my dollar say
Ain't about no guap then stop, homie, we can't conversate
Mobb Deep and Juicy J been balling harder than Doctor J
Broke niggas what we can't tolerate
Got that movie money, model chick came out jacuzzi money
Be that nigga ass, now you wanna sue me money
Still in this bitch, waking up at 5: 46 in the morning
Money calling, never stalling

Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, nothing you can tell us
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, all we do is kill it

Who the fuck is you and what the fuck do you know?
Where the hell did you come from and where the fuck you going?",Legendary,2014
Bun B,"I'm top ten, you tone up-top from the top tier
Tat his iPhone, the animal Ock I box bears
Got those quotes to Glock pop folks
Two times in the head and laugh, that's the knock-knock joke
Shots flying, I nail ya
Shots fly I nail ya, one eye open scopin I’m Popeye da Sailor
Used to get hungry off of the stress plate
Used to get money off a cassette tape
The best ain't made great
The godfather large armour logical, I'm on point chronological
I don't rock boots with spikes, nigga
Don't watch roots with white niggas
Bullets [?] when the eight's spitting
Blow this shit out of proportion, the race in racism
A degree for my declaration
When saying Sean P say da P with exclamation
Motherfucker

Let me tell you 'bout this story of a young'n
Raised in a ghetto that he was brung in
Round the drinkin' and druggin'
Had to box it out in backyards
So I put my Nike Airs on
And dug in the dirt and I started sluggin'
I lost some, I won some, but I fought them all
Trying not to be another name upon the wall
Lots of murals that's been painted in memory of
But I'm still here so before I'm gone gimme the love
Imma take my flowers now when I can still smell 'em
Then roll up the strongest trees and inhale em
The world is getting worse everyday I try to tell em
As long as you keep buying the lies then they gon' sell 'em
Y'all niggas is mad and they tired, ready to act out
You can't keep killing them and not expect them to black out
You locked the front doors on 'em and they take the backround
All your shit will leave your face with the shit smacked out

I’m fraying but I’m saying that I’m spraying cause I am if I have to
Salute the niggas laying on the land like a statue
If I say I’m staying where I stand I'ma vanish
If I say I'm out, I'm playing with the menace
That's like beef or vendetta
You wouldn't understand the goals without a mask on your face
Shoulda really feel somthing, when they blast in your face
If you playing in the jungle feel the wrath of those apes
But I'm positive and negative, ignorant and conscience too
Listen to the angels, but watch what the monsters do
You addicted niggas sponsor you
Tell you have another one, watch that shit conquer you
Even the wise do foolish shit
Even the cop kill a kid that go to school and shit
Believe it or not, stand still and you can move with it
Open your eyes and I ain't even got to prove this shit

Oh my god
How I humble myself
As I bow to your throne
I pray for love, peace and happiness
To be present in my home
Yes, I do
And let your heart",Top Tier,2015
Bun B,"Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
She know when I call it's for a reason, so come through
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
Except these bitches n that coupe
Ain't too many loyal niggas, I just know a few
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do

Used to keep money in a shoe box
Now I'm pulling up like tube socks
Went from a dollar to a few knots
Got me paying rent on 'bout two spots
They don't understand what my crew got
Remember long talks with my big bruh Cam
Young wild niggas in the bend selling grams
Man the pain and the struggle, man, that made me who I am
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
Jumped off that porch, I changed my mindset and my view
Reasons why you hate to see me win, I wish I knew
Came straight out that mud
You just don't know what I've been through
Look really no time for the talk, nigga I ain't got free time
Now-a-days I be all over green like the mothafuckin' d-line
And I ain't got time for the hoe when I barely got me time
Just give me a blunt and booth, mothafucka I'll be fine

Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
She know when I call it's for a reason, so come through
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
Except these bitches n that coupe
Ain't too many loyal niggas, I just know a few
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do

Trill OG, I'm riding lowkey
With my hat low and my deuce up
Smoking on me some killer kush
My young partner pouring up that juice up
Doing me, so keep doing you
'Cause I ain't down with what you in to
See me, I'm a trill nigga through and through
And I'm out here looking for the chewing to
That's word to skinny pimp
Just a gangster walking with a limp
And you know I got no love for a simp
Posted up, nigga, eating steak and shrimp
Lil bitch got my knife and I got my fork
Benz outside and it's valet parked
Blunt rolled up and I'm 'bout to spark
In the city lights, I smash out in the dark
Can't be but who I am
Got to represent for my fam
Cadillac doors still getting slammed
Don't like it, sorry don't give a damn
Still down, still trill
Gon' be that way 'til I'm dead and gone
For PA I'm putting on with my candy paint
And my shiny chrome, come on

Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
She know when I call it's for a reason, so come through
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
Except these bitches n that coupe
Ain't too many loyal niggas, I just know a few
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do",B*tches n That Coupe,2015
Bun B,"[Pimp C]
Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin'

I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin up (choppin' on dubs and showin 'em love)
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch)
Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin'
Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A
Playin' the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Chorus]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' comin' Up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin' up (choppin' on dubs and showin' 'em love)
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch)
Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin' up",Comin Up,2016
Bun B,"Say, R.I.P. To Pimp C, he was the King of The South
If you hating on that, you need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil J til' the muthafuckin' grave
Disrespect, they gon' put your picture on the front page
I'm center stage shining in a foreign you ain't seen yet
Chrome look like water, and my caddy paint is lean wet
Don't forget the rims, them muthafuckas a clean set
You can't tell me this ain't cost ya boy a mean check
Looking like a G in here, been here and I'm gon be in here
When it's over, I'm gon be the only one you see in here
Repping PAT in here, realer than these other guys
A Triple OG bitch, don't let them tell you otherwise

Young nigga out here on the rides
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me (smoke somethin' hold up)
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me (smoke somethin' hold up bitch)

Put Multi on the mountaintop
Drop the label just to raise the stock
You ain't seen a trunk with tinted pop
Full of 15s that'll make it knock
With them neon lights that'll make you say, get in line or get down hoe
If it wasn't about the player money to be made, what the fuck you come around for?
This is big business, talking skyscrapers, screens rise like smoke vapors
Candy paint's when it's now-a-laters
Bitch, I'm on the up like an elevator if you didn't know
Shine the grill just to let it show
On them emotional mothafuckas in the game
Tucking they nuts, while I'm letting mine hang
Chromed out the rim, letting it swang
Went from have-not to having some thang
Diamonds out the window, gripping the grain
One finger will put the sun to the rain
Ya'll niggas thought I wasn't gon' be a king like I'm sposed'
But, I learned from UGK, Multi, 4eva in A Day on these hoes

Young nigga out here on the rides
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me (smoke somethin' hold up)
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me (smoke somethin' hold up bitch)

This for all the underground, we on the surface
South and holding, remote controlling
Got the game and it ain't for purchase
Ain't no hurting when you win
Up the cut like in it, touch down on it
Clown on it, cheerlead if you wit it hoe
Old school on his tippy toes
Chop the base and shake the doors
Fade the top, then let it show
How it taste? I got to know
Icy grill, cold enough to freeze the snow
Bruce Leroy shownuff that bumping dragon
Bitch I got the glow
Got the cake, smash it in your face
I got more to make, I'm on the chase
For a bread truck to put off in my safe
And let it bake, stingy with the flakes
All the crumbs get ate, off the plate
Soppin' up with the lobster shrimp and steak

Bun B,"My misophonia brought the faders up
Now she's a military grade, in
Dolby surround, around five-point-one 'cause
The barking from the baritone
Conductor in the pit for the car
Honk duet, half-tone harmony from
The sewer rebel youth choir belt
Phrases even newer, dump-truck man
Drops the beat with trash cans, call 911!
We got therapy demands
Philharmoninc got a first chair car
Crash, pan the falsetto to smash
The glass, it's a drive-by lullaby
That couldnt get worse, a melody
Abandoned in the key of New York
Where nothing comes after
I'm a passtime streamer, hanging
From the rafters, I don't get out
I don't have fun
Livin' like a captive of the sun

Sight-read the chart
Clap the rocks into sand
A twelve-pass van on a pothole bandstand
Got an oil-can hangover by default, and trucks pave
The roads with amphetamine salt
Skull-shakin' cadence of the J train
Rolls the rhythm of defeat, re- peating like a pulse, marching on
And static, lyrics shout a retort
To the melody abandoned in the key
Of New York",Captive of the Sun,2017

Yeah I'm smokin' gas baby girl but I ain't gassed up
You wanna be down, that's only if I let you
Let me marinate on it and maybe I'll come back and get you

Que llenen los corazones
Sobre todo las de los demás
Nos queda el mar y un buen pescado
Que comer a tu lado

Y eso sólo será si vuelves, claro
Los restos del naufragio
Quedaron esparcidos
O desaparecidos, o rotos

Nos queda Leonard Cohen
Tom Waits y Nick Cave
Jaime, Santiago, el Loco y Andrés
Charly, Fito, Spinetta, Érica

Andrea y, cómo no, esa mi Julieta
Nos queda Benarés, Marrakech
Cádiz, Buenos Aires
Y Santo Domingo, si nos dejan volver

Las señoritas que aún no conocemos
Nos queda la plaza cuando la gente se vaya
Nos queda el mar y un buen pescado
Que comer a tu lado

Y eso sólo será si vuelves, claro
Los restos del naufragio
Quedaron esparcidos
O desaparecidos, o rotos

Te escribo una carta para que tú sepas lo que ya sabías,
Aunque no lo dijeras.
Espero que llegue a tus manos y,
Que no la devuelvas.

Que pagues el rescate que abajo te indico.
Yo tampoco me explico, por qué no acudí antes a ti.
Pero nadie puede salvarme,
Nadie sabe lo que sabes,
Y tampoco entregarían lo que vale mi rescate.

No hay dinero, ni castillos,
Ni avales, ni talonarios,
No hay en este mundo, aunque parezca absurdo,
Ni en planetas por descubrir, lo que aquí te pido.
Y no te obligo a nada que no quieras.
Las fuerzas me fallan, mis piernas no responden
Te conocen, pero no llegan a ti.

Decidí por eso mismo, un mecanismo de defensa.
Presa como está mi alma, con la calma suficiente,
Ser más fuerte, y enfrentarme cuanto antes a la verdad,
Sin dudar un segundo, lo asumo,
Sólo tú puedes pagar el rescate.

Devuélveme el amor que me arrebataste,
O entrégaselo, lo mismo me da, al abajo firmante
Pues no hay en este mundo, aunque parezca absurdo,
Ni en planetas por descubrir, lo que aquí te pido.

Y no te obligo a nada que no quieras.

Bunbury,"Mikel Erentxun Carta de amor (cuando no hay amor) letra
Hoy te escribo esta carta porque siempre te quejabas de que nunca te enviaba cartas de amor.
Decías que era frío, que era todo indiferente y buscaste un continente para entregar tu calor.
Tal vez tu ONG se pueda ocupar de resucitar a hombres que siguen vivos.

Las cartas que no envías sólo son cartas marcadas, te regalan una mano pero nunca un corazón.
Mi casa está pidiendo una mano de pintura y algún punto de sutura para hacer punto final.
Y si estás en un país del Africa Central busca pronto un hechicero que me enseñe a olvidar.

Cartas de amor cuando ya no hay amor.
Cartas de amor, pero sin dirección.

Mi hospital de campaña, mi amuleto de la suerte, una firme barricada... lo eras todo para mí,
Pero hay cosas en la vida que son mucho más reales que los ojos que las miran.
Dime que fuí para ti. Dime que fuí para ti. Dime si en algún momento me llegaste a querer.

Per intuire tutti i sensi unici
A volte o quasi sempre io mi perdo
Nella notte
Decido poi di scivolarti addosso
E cancellare tutto e niente ti appartiene

Ma
C'è qualcosa dentro che
Mi morde l'anima
L'amore che distrugge come un cielo
A fulmine

Il nostro cuore fuorilegge
Spara colpi di dolore
È troppo tempo che non si fa più L'amore
Non scorre il sangue dentro al fiume Che ci portava verso il mare

Quel mare immenso

Adesso non mi pento più e rimango
Qui da solo
Dipingo la memoria alle pareti
Lo so che quasi sempre io dimenticavo
Il senso
Non respiravo venti più leggeri
Ma è scivolato tutto e niente ti appartiene

Ma
C'è qualcosa dentro che
Mi morde l'anima
L'amore che distrugge come un cielo
A fulmine

Il nostro cuore fuorilegge
Spara colpi di dolore
È troppo tempo che non si fa più L'amore
Non scorre il sangue dentro al fiume Che ci portava verso il mare

Immenso
Come radici agli alberi d'inverno
Senza più foglie
Quel mare dentro
Che spegne e annega ogni tormento
Mi toglie il fiato ma poi ancora
Respiro
Senza più fiamme

È troppo tempo che non si fa più l'amore",Il  Mare immenso,2017
Bungaro,"L'amore pesa dentro a una casa 
Come l'attesa per una sposa 
L'amore cambia quando si spoglia 
E mentre si guarda allo specchio 
Non trova la voglia 

Ma io ti stupirò 
Io ti stupirò 

A me non devi dire mai 
Quello che provo non lo sai 
A me non serve tempo 
Cammino controvento 

E non mi importa se ci sei 
A me non devi dire mai 
Amore io ti invento e poi 
Ti tengo dentro 

L'amore arriva quando finisce 
Improvvisamente ti riconosce 
L'amore inganna 
Ti compra una rosa 
E mentre ti meraviglia 
Ti ha già rubato ogni cosa 

Ma io ti stupirò 
Io ti stupirò 

A me non devi dire mai 
Quello che provo non lo sai 
A me non serve tempo

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1965
Bunky Green,"Everything I have is yours
You are part of me

And the stars that shine

Bunky Green,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1989
Bunky Green,"The thrill is gone!
The thrill is gone!
I can see it in your eyes,
I can hear it in your sighs,
Feel your touch and realize
The thrill is gone.
The nights are cold,
For love is old.
Love was grand when love was new,
Birds were singing, skies were blue.
Now it don't appeal to you,
The thrill is gone.
This is the end, so why pretend
And let it linger on.
The thrill is gone!",The Thrill Is Gone,1989
Bunky Green,"Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me and no one beside me
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?

And a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me 
So remember when you tell those little white lies

Though you keep telling me that you're lonely

One of these days you're gonna be sorry 
'Cause your game I'm gonna play 
And you'll find out without really trying

Bunky Jones,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team

You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

In a manner oh gravissimo, he repeats his serenade,
And his heart beats so fortissimo, when she raises her Venetian shade.
Ciribiribin, chiribiribin, ciribiribin.
Ciribiribin, he waits for her each night beneath her balcony.
Ciribiribin, he begs to hold her tight, but no, she won't agree.
Ciribiribin, she throws a rose and blows a kiss from up above,

About the women and children first,
The men had much more charm than they have today.
And if only one of that type survived,
The very moment that he arrived,
I know I'd fall in love in a great big way.
I can't imagine being bad
With any Arrow collar ad,
Nor could I take the slightest joy
In waking up a college boy.
I've no desire to be alone
With Rudy Vallee's megaphone,
So when I'm saying my prayers, I say:

Find me a primitive man,
Built on a primitive plan.
Someone with vigor and vim.
I don't mean a kind that belongs to a club,
But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.
The only man who'll ever win me
Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,
Find me a primitive man,
Find me a primitive man.

Trouve moi un homme primitif
Trouve moi un garcon naif.
Quelqu'un tout plein de vigeur,
Ces p'tits maquereaux qu'on appelle gigolos ne
Pourraient jamais donner le vrai bonheur.

Pour chauffeur mon chaffage centrale.
Et l'homme qui me veut pour capitane
Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,
Trouve moi un homme primitif.

(Find me a primitive man,
Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,
Those fatuous beaux they call gigolos could never give me happiness.

To heat up my own central heat.
And he who aspires to be my stud
Must reawake my gypsy blood.

Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

To whistle loud and long.

Bunny Franks,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

Real life preservation
What I'm hustling for
My name black thought
The definition of raw
I was born in South Philly
On a cement floor
I had nothing at all
Had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall
Be another brick in the wall
Another life
Full of love
That lost
That's silly
This Philly
Y'all really ain't stoppin'
The boy with the pen
Like Willie
On top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city
Most popular for
Hear the tones
That will ease you
Smooth
As Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin' your head boppin' and all
It's something in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody fifty cents
From a quarter
Where I come from
Yeah
The streets ain't timid
But I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people
I ain't got at
In a minute
Yeah
You can take a brother outta South Philly
Can't take it outta him really
I forever represent it
And it's

[Chorus]

[Peedi Peedi]
Live and dirvet
I don't need no mic check
Remember mommy told me
You ain't write that
It started in the bathroom taking a dump
Listening to Ultramagnetic
Ego tripping you won't
Pressure my word
I'm the urban vision
Of you chump
Stomped on a different ground
Sound second to none
Synthesizers tweet
To improvise your feet
I calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat
It's free
Come get high on me
Before a nine millimeter shell
Hit my pelle pelle
In the p
Yeah
It's somethin' in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody
Fifty cents from a quarter
Yo
Where I come from
It's just a natural reaction
For crack to make it happen
Let the pen ink sink
Into the paper of the pad
Think back
When I was younger
Ghetto could have took me under
Young Peedi can't mess with North Philly
Never had
You don't know about me
You ain't stroll my streets
Look familiar
I feel ya
Longtime no see

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Clap somethin'
But whatever you clap
Clap to the record spinnin'
While I'm takin' you back
To the top paper era
Baby big on that
Picture the pool room
Where the money getters was at
And street people
With feather in the cap
Or their bossolino pullin' paper
As if it's a small casino
I was a young boy
Sweepin' the floors
And runnin' to stores
But all those old heads
Would talk to me About the way
To clutch the eagle
On a buck and truck
And if I'm down
How to get back up
Just survival kid
And it's a struggle worldwide
I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well
Be the Gaza Strip
You know where all the monsters is
Street walkers
You don't see no consciousness I'm coming back to where
The core of the problem is
We on the job again
Y'all know what time it is

Make up for our lost
I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you,

Our hearts beat, so fast

Taking place inna I-ration, inna I-ration
It's the Amagideon!
Taking place inna I-ration 

In the beginning there was but one concept
And that's the concept of I 
Then arose Apollyon the devil (Satan! Satan!) 
Claiming that it's you and I
And from that day on, there is trouble
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
From that day on
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
We've got wars and rumours of wars 
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Nations rising up against nations 
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Mother against daughter
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Father against son 
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Little children having children (trouble! trouble!)

It's the Amagideon!
Taking place inna I-ration, inna I-ration
It's the Amagideon!
Taking place inna I-ration

I see light fighting against darkness
Righteousness against evil
Right battling against wrong
Here comes bondage, struggling for freedom
But have patience I I-dren have patience! 
Don't be burdened by reasons of tribulations
Have patience I I-dren have patience!
Remember the call of redemption
It says: Blessed art the poor
(They shall inherit the earth)
Blessed art the meek
(They shall have a birth)
Them that hunger and thirst after righteousness
Them alone shall be called blessed 

It's the Amagideon!
Taking place inna I-ration, inna I-ration
It's the Amagideon!
Taking place inna I-ration

Walk beyond to the pastors that lead my sheep astray 
Everyone, everyone shall get his pay, yes
For the gates of hell just could never prevail 
I'd like to say: Babylon failed
There is one like unto a place of fire
His name I can tell
He is conquering and to conquer
The gates of doom and hell 
And life, long life, is His reward
To them that are good 
As for the heathen, as for the heathen
In their hearts His name is terrible and dreadful

Bunny Wailer,"Tikya the Blackheart Man, children
I say, don't go near him
Tikya the Blackheart Man children
For even lions fear him (repeat)

Growing in a neighbourhood for such along time
That is filled with fear
I can't go here, can't go there
And I ain't supposed to go anywhere
When I ask my Mom if she could let me go out and play
She said be careful of the stranger
Giving candies to children
And then take them away

He lives in the gullies of the city
He's the Blackheart Man (The blackheart Man)

Even in the lonely parts of the country
He's the Blackheart Man, Blackheart Man
Got no friend, no home, no family
He's the Blackheart 'Man, The Blackheart Man
He is famed to live just like the Gypsy
He's the Blackheart 'Man, The Blackheart Man

Growing and learning and gathering, for myself a little more
Experience jumping over the fence
Curiousity has brought me yes it's brought me, a little common-sense
Trodding the road of life, I've come to this one conclusion
That everything is equal under the sun, all that is createdby JAH mighty hand
And he said knock and it shall be opened
Seek and Ye shall find that wisdom is found in the simplest of places,
In the nick of time, knock and it shall be opened
Seek and ye shall find that wisdom is found in the simplest of places, in the nick of
Time and now I trod the same road of aflictions just like the
Blackheart Man, just like the Blackheart Man
Getting my share of humiliation just like the Blackheart Man
Just like the Blackheart Man
You'll find me even in the prison of the dungeons
Just like the Blackheart Man, just like the the Blackheart Man
I even get blamed without a reason just like the Blackheart Man
Just like the Blackheart man yau

No cross, no crown, no sorrow, no trial and crosses In-a-I way
But the hotter the battle is the sweeter JAH JAH victory
Ancient children use to say if you want good
Your nose got to run run run
How could the world go free, and let JAH bear the cross alone
And them that drink of the old wine hath no place for the new
For the new and the stones that are head of the corner are the
Same one that the builders refused
Now, it's the Blackheart Man, children
Who've become the wonder of the city (rep).

I find myself growing in an environment 
Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trials and tribulations
I've seen where some have died in desperation
To keep battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto
Hustling is the only education I know
Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle
A situation like this is getting too hard to handle
To keep battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

With a pregnant woman, yes
and five kids to care for
Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town
As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me
I pray the day will come when I shall be free from 
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury
Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy
Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeons
I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

Now a fugitive at large
Could this be my destiny
With no one to care for the welfare of my family
But in solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary
Just couldn't take no more

Bunny Wailer,"The man oppressed will seem to do the worst
But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes from not burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

While oppression is the poor man's choice
Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

Though his pilgrimage extends, his progresses ascends
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows
There's no rest in the west, so to the east he goes, to the east he goes
Where he can find peace of mind, oh",The Oppressed Song,1976

Living on earth, heat air and water in this time (rep.)

Which ever become man
All because of the devine plan

Over all earth was as he given dominion

He who has eves to see
Let him look yonder

As you strive toward the accomplishment of your missions
As you seek to feed the sheep of the shepherd

But there is too much pollution in the land

Too much confusion The whole world is suffering from illusions

But Redemption stands within the Scheme of things
The Redeemer is called the King of Kings
Who purifies the soul from unclean things,
So know your place within the scheme of things.

Wise ones will hear and will increase their learnings
From the words of the wise and their Bright sayings,
Now how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicities
You'd better rise and awake from your slumbering mentalities.

For the wind of desperation will increase crime-waves and demonstrations
But the rock of discretion will calm the floods of conflict and convictions.

Lesser tights to rule by night.

Adjust or even rearrange them

So who are you to try them, price them and sell them
Who are you to slave them and to
Kill them before them born
Who are you to hunt them down
Run them down and gun them down

Put thern to shame and scorn.

Bunny Wailer,"Ever since the abolition of slavery, all nations
Scarred by the great sore, has revolutionized the
Ideological errors of their forefathers, creating a
Civilization where human beings of whatever color, race
Or creed, should be born with the equal privileges of
The Fundamental Humans Rights, as established by The
League of Nations with respect to all human beings.

But if human beings are what they are supposed to be,
Then surely this cannot be seen in Botha, and if the
Beast was discovered in Adolph Hitler and Mussolini,
The antichrists, evidently, this can be seen in
President Botha, the mosquito.

Hey!
President Botha is the mosquito
Who annihilate Africa.
President Botha with the deadly bite
Spreads the disease of apartheid.

It was Columbus, Drake, Hawkins, Raleigh and Scott
Who established colonialism.
This aspired Livingston, Rhodes and Smith
Who brought about a sub-human regime.
With the aid and support from mystery Babylon
Started the buying and selling of Africans.

It became a marketplace for human cargo
And the burial ground for the inhabitants.

From the stagnant swamps of colonialism
Sprung the virus of apartheid.
From the rituals of imperialism
Evolves mass murders and genocide.
Unquenchable greed and lust for power
Blind the eye to international morality.
Neglect and disrespect for humanity
Scares the whole international community.

President Botha. Hey!
Respect Tutu and Mandela.
President Botha. Pull out!
Pull out a Africa.
President Botha. Hey!
Respect Tutu and Mandela.
President Botha. Ease!
Pull out a Africa.

Marcus Mosiah Garvey of Jamaica
Prophesied of a liberated Africa.
When the East and the West and the North together
Unites to liberate South Africa.

Could cause racial confrontations.

Should there be famine, wars and strifes?
For like the ant should man proceed
To fulfill his want and need.
And that is food!

And without it you're in a devastating mood.
Oh yes that's food.
You better treat it like you know you should.
And that is food.
And without it you're in a mal nutritious mood.
Oh yes that's food.
You better treat it like you know you should.

You better give it just as much as you could.

It bread is for man to eat,
Why should he die from lack of meat?
For in the multitude of wine and laughter
He's suffering from hunger.
From want for food!

Their afflictions should the world take a lesson from.
For if today is for them then tomorrow is for us
For in arms do we put our trust.

And you are not the boss-man.

Were cargoed into the west, 
Where for over 400 years they have toiled and laboured,

Bunny Wailer,"Mr. president, distinguished delegates,

Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of one love
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace.
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars, Selah!

See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the Sunday papers
not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed 'cause
Inna dem churches tryin' to save, saviors

Can we do it? we can do it, we shall do it!

Boom! Tell dem fe uh draw mi out when the world government inna falling out
Only few men survive crawling out
Run left him colleagues dem sprawling out, nearly dead!
Medic haffi haul him out
And give him two tranquilizer fi stall him out, deh pon base!
Can't get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
Him mistress find a new shoes
Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt, she still searching!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Baghdad to water house
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout, guns come out!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out, bombs come out!
Mi gas tank just run out, bombo clatt!
The scotch tape just run out, weed run out!
Yuh senses must dumb out, mi have a pound round a back deh a gwan sun out
Nah come out! 'Til the chalice bun out,
Nah come out! 'Til the malice bun out, a war!

Blazin' like a burnin' ball, loose ball, dat no work, in war
Sleeping, dat no work..in war
Can't wear jheri curl, in war
No diamond and pearl, in war

Gas wi fuck up yuh nerves, in war
Shot wi blood up yuh shirt, in war
Can't go lift up no skirt, in war
Now disease and germs, in war
Can't go release your sperms, in war
Stamina must preserve, in war
Fire constantly burn, in war
Red, it red, it red, it red, it red!

If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it, then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings

Hey, now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the sky's over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up,
Searching for the sign and the sign is us,
Searching for the truth all you find is us,
Searching for the troops still behind is us,
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach building boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari' design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you tell-lie-vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up,
And who alling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down

Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl, institute of the church in war
Preaching and researching war
Practice and rehearsing war
Teaching and dem learning war
Instigating and urging war
Always keep alert in war
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds in war
And the freaks and nerds in war
And the straight and curves in war
Forward and reverse in war
Red, it red, it red, it red, it red

We'll get our honey from the bees
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls
And all the glories, we'll have them all

Your choice completely
You take the bed and I'll take the sofa

You can crash at mine, it's fine 
If you decline but you can
Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash at mine

Late night, long drive, God knows how we both survive
Bright lights outside, honour ruined, left behind
First impression, you mention not to knock you but
An exception, I don't do this all the time

Crash, crash, crash
You can crash at mine tonight
I'll let you decide, oh you can
Crash, crash, crash, 
You can crash at mine, it's fine 
If you decline but you can
Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash at mine

Crash at mine

There's no pressure
Easy with whatever
Don't wanna leave you cold
There's no agenda
Only shelter from the night
Let's get inside, oh

You can crash at mine tonight

Logro o feitiço de Tomé Grande

What your body's sayin' to mine

I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes

No, I feel the water is calling
The wood under our bare feet cries
Every animal came to watch
The first and last to love die.

What a wretched man I am
Who will rescue Me from this body of death?

Always told where to go
I've been fed and forced and filled
They engraved everything I know

Never question their laws or gods
I'd be shot on site
I fall in line, give up my mind
And live their fucking lives

Before I knew it, I'm just like them
Before I knew it, I'm fucking dead

And do we really believe
That we are even alive?
I'm living and breathing
Building my own way

Those things that mean so much
Don't mean a thing to me

It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say

Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

The landlord even smiled and said good day
And I want you to know that a stranger said hello

Old tight wad down the street is a buying candy
To pass out to the neighbor kids at play
The town is on the go and the weather man says snow
Christmas can't be far away

The small fry on our block have all been saving
And now their hiding things and looking sly
Mum will get that doodad she's been craving
And dad will get his usual Christmas tie

Both young and old are planning sweet surprises
They'll soon be tied with ribbons bright and gay

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love

Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn

But I never could please her one quarter so well 
As the man on the flying trapeze!

His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away

His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!

While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!

His actions are graceful, all girls he does please

Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!

His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease
You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
Her actions are graceful, all girls she does please 
And that's what's become of my love

Burl Ives,"I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers 
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours. 
Then today in the mail I received this short little note 
And I broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote. 

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again;
We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then.
They know that she loves me, but poor boys don't fit in their plan. 
Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann. 

The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then; 
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been. 
I can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again 
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann.

My Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away; 
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today.
For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone, 
Today she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone.

Burl Ives,"AUNT RHODY
Go tell Aunt Rhody, go tell Aunt Rhody,
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old gray goose is dead.
The one she's been saving to make a feather bed.
The old gander's weeping, because his wife is dead.
The goslings are mourning, because their mother's dead.
She died in the mill pond from standing on her head.
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old gray goose is dead.

Burl Ives,"When I was a bachelor I lived all alone
I worked at the weaver's trade
And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
Was to woo a fair young maid

I wooed her in the winter time
Part of the summer too
And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew

One night she knelt close by my side
When I was fast asleep
She threw her arms around my neck
And then began to weep

She wept, she cried, she tore her hair
Ah, me, what could I do?
So all night long, I held her in my arms
Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew

Again I am a bachelor, I live with my son
We work at the weaver's trade
And every single time that I look into his eyes
He reminds me of that fair young maid

He reminds me of the wintertime
Part of the summer too
And of the many, many times that I held her in my arms
Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew

Down by the road on a green shady flat
Where Betsy got tired and lay down to repose

Burl Ives,"There was a little railroad train with loads and loads of toys
All starting out to find a home with little girls and boys
And as that little railroad train began to chug along
The little engine up in front was heard to sing this song

Choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, I feel so good today
Oh, clear the track, oh clickety clack, I?ll go my merry way

The little train went roaring on, so fast, it seemed to fly
Until it reached a mountain rising almost to the sky
The little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away
But halfway to the top it just gave up and seemed to say

I can't go on, I can't go on, I'm weary as can be
I can't go on, I can't go on, this job is not for me

The toys got out to push but all in vain alas, alack
And then a great big engine came a whistling down the track
They asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountain side
But with a high and mighty sneer it scornfully replied

don't bother me, don't bother me to pull the likes of you
Don't bother me, don't bother me, I've better things to do

The toys all started crying ?cause that engine was so mean
And then there came another one, the smallest ever seen
But though it seemed that she could hardly pull herself along
She hitched on to the train and as she pulled she sang this song

I think I can, I think I can, I think I have a plan
And I can do 'most anything if I only think I can

Then up that great big mountain with the cars all full of toys
And soon they reached the waiting arms of happy girls and boy
And though that ends the story it will do you lots of good
To take a lesson from the little engine that could

Just think you can, just think you can, just have that understood
And very soon you'll start to say, I always knew I could

Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

“For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

Was to woo a fair young maid

And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew

One night she knelt close by my side
When I was fast asleep
She threw her arms around my neck
And then began to weep

She wept, she cried, she tore her hair
Ah, me, what could I do?
So all night long, I held her in my arms

Come along with us,
To the glorious
Annual ugly bug ball.""

All the ants were fancy-dancing with the fleas
Then up from under the ground
The worms came squirming around

Oh they danced until there legs were nearly lame

Everyone was glad
What a time they had
They were so happy they came

She was beautiful in yellow, black and green
He said, ""Would you care to dance?""
Their dancing led to romance.

And she sat upon his caterpillar knees
And he gave his caterpillar queen a squeeze
Soon they'll honeymoon
Build a big cocoon

And your eyes consistently understand

Down the highway, he would walk along
Singin' old songs, singin' Sunday blues
But his school bells were his only song
Yes his school bells were his only song

Through the fire, through the lying sun
Through the smoke and fog
Through the day that's done
There was strength there
There was hope alive
There were strings of peace
From the other side
There were strings of peace
From the other side

He lived a good life
He was a good man
He lived a good life
But he was dancing to the bright lights
He was dying for some love

Don't you see he's falling away
Thank God for the love that you gave
Only love can put out a fire
And only love was calling him
Higher and higher

He was a good man
He lived a good life
He was a good man
He lived a good life
But he was dancing to the bright lights
He was dying for some love

And the light hits the ground
There's a moment to be captured

So I sit here with silence
In the makes of my eyes
Talking to you, who left before

I don't know why
I don't know why
These things, I cannot

It comes with the gig, I feel it dwelling
The friends, away, afraid of me
And I know I'm near
But my pride is selling

Trading for hearts of humble peers
Trading for hearts of humble peers
And she comes with the son
Her light is shining, beaming with love

Flying to the ocean
And I, I know the seagulls
When I see her flying reaching out to the bones
That are casually roasting

And my skin is burning with the fire of the world
Sometimes my eyes are tricking me
But when the words of His song
Are singing through the birds

I can't help but die, so He can take me higher
I can't help but die, so He can take me higher

And this dark small pain grows like cancer
Sometimes her eyes are speaking to me
But when the flesh is gone, my soul is all I travel by

I can't help but die, so He can take me higher

Broke niggas, you heard? 
They do what they gotta do 
Now ask yourself, which one are you 
Ha, fall back 

I had some problems 
And no one could seem to solve them 
But you found the answer 
Told me to take this chance 

Soakin' in Remy 
Sittin' back smokin' a twenty 
Shit is scabby 
The hustlin' is so in me 
Never so envy, got a style on max 
I'm like Po 
Packin' eighty four 
Now smile at that 
Unseen when I'm low 
But still right in your face 
I'm so skinny 
But that semi-autos right in my waist 
From Jags to Jeeps 

With them raggedy seats 
Just imagine how I'm movin' if we had any beats 
Beats relax me 
Good cheeba keeps me nasty 
Lower the smoke when I see the G's creepin' past me 
Duckin' a notch 
Bustin Dutches apart 
Love pussy wit pretty lips 
When you fuck it it fart

Rock Timbs in the summer or ten below 
Blood in streets

See me hit 
Then see my rich 
Get bagged over some bullshit 
Then see me snitch 
Hopin' some days old bitch will leave me sick 
Like I'm a sucker for love wit some easy dick 
I did dirt through my days 
But hit my worth 
Even then I still made sure no kids got hurt

Been on since my feet got wet 
From the best turned vet 
Learned to speak direct

",Brave New World,1993
Burning Heads,"You say that you ain't got a problem just when it comes into view
Always the same face, lost in the big mace
There's nowhere to hide for you.
Sometimes you act like a child as if you were million miles away
Always the same smile, you pretend to feel fine...
I got something to tell you,do you understand it?
I've got a message for you,won't you take it.
You close your eyes and you think there's no porblem
Just open your eyes, see you're falling
There was a time when we used to be friends
But now,what has vecome of you?
You follow the mainstream, always the same scene,ignoring the world around
Sometimes you act like a child, refusing to face the truth, always the same smile
You say ""I fell fine""



",Falling,1993
Burning Heads,"I still remember what we used to say
When we said ""we're just as one""
We were heading for the promised land
Keep the faith, I'm still close to you.
Nothing can separate us now

in the hardtimes
I'll be by your side
Let's find a way out
I won't change the way I look at you
You're not a alien

there's something now in your blood
I know it hurts, it hurts you deep inside
Don't let despair invade your heart
I'll be there, I won't let you down
I promise nothing can separate us now

in the hardimes, I'll be by your side
Let's find a way out
Together

Oh, shine your light

Ends justify means when you making a meet
When you losing the sleep that you saying you need
But what good is rest when it's family to feed
When it's money to get, when it's dollars to count
Fuck a job, you never raised for larger amounts
Keep the lights on, front door locked
'Cause the villains in the wilderness, lotta George Zimmermans
Damned with some innocence
So that mean he still out on the prowl for a black child
While the judge and jury crack smile, Lord
Keep the lights burning

I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
'Cause it's hard to sleep living life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's a phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, unknowing we slaves

And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishing I had wings
Like a dunk in the Summer but I ain't had Spring
'Cause all that running from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothing to say
'Cause all that working for something but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators, and piranhas
Till the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shooting to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speaking to family and friends

So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me

Are passing fancies

These my heart understands

That's how I want to be

To stay old fashioned with me

And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea

And picked upon the bones of last week's news
She spoke his name out loud again

Burt Bacharach,"When I go to sleep, you become my thief 
Why don`t you steal what you can keep? 
But you won`t let me be 
You break into my dreams 
And every day seems different 
Sometimes I pretend you`ll come back again 
And you`ll console the heart you stole 
Have pity on the man 
Who knows that you have gone 
And has begun to break down 

I feel almost possessed 
So long as I don`t lose this glorious distress then 
You can take all I have left 
I know it`s over 
If you can`t be my lover 
Be my thief 

I`m so drowsy now, I`ll unlock the door 
What fades in time will hurt much more 
So here`s that happy scene 
Where you come back to me 
It`s only found in fiction 

I feel almost possessed 
So long as I don`t lose this glorious distress then 
You can take all I have left 
I know it`s over 
If you can`t be my lover 
Be my thief 

""I didn't lead you on, 
But there will always be 
A little larceny in everyone 

So hush and don`t you cry 
I`m trying to be kind 
Because I have a perfect alibi""",My Thief,1998
Burt Bacharach,"Such a picture of loveliness 
Didn't you notice the resemblance? 
Doesn't it look like she could speak? 
Those eyes I tried to capture 
They are lost to me now forever 
They smile for someone else 

Funny, how looks can be deceiving 
But she`s not easily 
Painted from memory 

You`d think that I would know by now 
Those eyes I tried to capture 
They are lost to me now forever 
They smile for someone else 

And so this had to be 
Painted from memory 

She is gone, and I must accept it 
She is lost to me now 
But I can`t look away just yet though 
She smiles for someone else 

And so this had to be 
Painted from memory 

Funny, now I can see 
How looks can be deceiving 

And so this had to be 
Painted from memory

How looks can be deceiving",Painted from Memory,1998
Burt Bacharach,"On a hot city day
When your white shirt turns to grey
That's when she'll arrive
When you look how you feel
Someone steps upon your heel
That's when she will come
Listen now
I'm not saying that there will be violins
But don't be surprised if they appear
Playing in some doorway
Still I can't believe that this is happening

We're such unlikely lovers
Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by
Ask me what I'm thinking, and I won't deny it
Can you believe it's happening?
Can you believe it's happening?

There were no magic spells
You can keep the flowers and bells
They just don't seem right
Can it actually be?
Me and you and you and me
Though we're like day and night

Listen now
I'm not saying that there will be violins
But don't be surprised if they appear
Playing in some doorway
Still I can't believe that this is happening

We're such unlikely lovers
Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by
Ask me what I'm feeling, and I won't deny it
Can you believe it's happening?
I am bewildered
Can you believe it's happening?
Somebody help me
Can you believe it's happening?",Such Unlikely Lovers,1998
Burt Bacharach,"You only saw red
After I said, ""how can we continue?""
Hidden from your view
In the blue corner that I painted myself into
Then we started to fight
And it changed everything
Here's the ring

You dropped the band, I can't understand it
Not after all we've been through
Words start to fly, my glass jaw and I
Will find one to walk right into

You knocked me out
It was the sweetest punch
The bell goes...

I can hear it ringing, but I didn't see it coming
We all say things we don't mean
You can't take it back

Now the room is spinning, but was I the last to notice?
I can see I'll never win
So if you're going
Then you better go to him
Then you better go to him

I only saw stars
I dropped my guard, and that's how it ended
What was I to do
In the blue corner where I seemed to hang suspended?

Then with seconds to go
You delivered the blow
Here I go

You dropped the band, I can't understand it
Not after all we've been through
Words start to fly, my glass jaw and I
Will find one to walk right into

You knocked me out
It was the sweetest punch
The bell goes...

I can hear it ringing, but I didn't see it coming
We all say things we don't mean
You can't take it back

Now the room is spinning, but was I the last to notice?
I can see I'll never win
So if you're going
Then you better go to him
Then you better go to him",The Sweetest Punch,1998
Burt Bacharach,"Think back now when we were young
There were always tears at the birthday party
You know how children can be
So cruel
That's how it starts, but
What if we never learn how to behave?
I did something, and you never forgave me
I never thought that it could be like this

But now I see
I see you share your cake with him
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent
What can I do?
Must I watch you?

Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again

And it's the same every year
Seems that I remember it as something more, but
You know how children can grow
So strange
I still adore you

What if we never learn from our mistakes?
But then, you'll never know how my heart aches

I never thought that it would be like this
But now I see
I see you share your cake with him
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent
What can I do?
Must I watch you?

Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again

One day I know he'll forget
To pay you the compliments you;re after
You'll hang your sad, aching head
Behind a brittle smile or a shrill of laughter

What if we only get what we deserve?
Somehow I couldn't quite summon the nerve

Upon each anniversary
Then do you ever think of me?
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent
What can I do?
Must I watch you?

Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles
So Happy Birthday again
Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles

Burt Bacharach,"These rooms play tricks upon you
Remember when they were always filled with laughter
But now they're quite deserted
They seem to just echo voices raised in anger
Maybe you will see my face
Reflected there on the pane
In the window up above for long
In broken home

Yet this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
To make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

These walls were lined with pictures
Remember the glass we charged in celebration
But now I fill my life up
With all that I can to deaden this sensation
Do you recognize the face
Fixed in that fine silver frame
Were you really so unhappy there
You never said

So this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do to make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Oh, if I could just become forgetful
When night seems endless
Does the extinguished candle care
About the darkness

It's funny how the memory
Will bring you so close then make you disappear
Meanwhile all our friends must choose
Who they will favor, who they will lose
Hang the garland high, or close the door
Or throw away the key

This house is empty now
There's no one living here
You have to care about
This house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
To make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

This house is empty now
This house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
This house is empty now
This house is empty now",This House Is Empty Now,1998
Burt Bacharach,"All through the night you telephoned 
I saw the light blinking red 
Beside the cradle 
But you don`t know how far I`ve gone 
Now I must live with the lie 
That I made 
But if I call, I know I won`t have to say it 
You`ll hear my voice - something is bound to betray it 

But do people living in Toledo 
Know that their name hasn't traveled very well? 
And does anybody in Ohio 
Dream of that Spanish citadel? 
But it`s no use saying that I love you 
And how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me 
For if anyone should look into your eyes 
It`s not forgiveness that they`re gonna see 

You hear her voice - ""How could you do that?"" 
You hear her voice - ""How could you do that?"" 

So I walked outside in the bright 
Sunshine and lovers pass by 
Smiling and joking 
But they don`t know the fool I was 
Why should they care what was lost 
What was broken? 

But if I call, I know I won`t have to say it 
You`ll hear my voice - something is bound to betray it 

But do people living in Toledo 
Know that their name hasn't traveled very well? 
And does anybody in Ohio 
Dream of that Spanish citadel? 
But it`s no use saying that I love you 
And how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me 
For if anyone should look into your eyes 
It`s not forgiveness that they`re gonna see 

But do people living in Toledo 
Know that their name hasn't traveled very well? 
And does anybody in Ohio 
Dream of that Spanish citadel? 
But we still have Florence, Alabama 
We don`t have Paris, and we don`t have Rome",Toledo,1998
Burt Bacharach,"What's her name today?
What's her name today?
She could be anyone
I might have known you'd leave her crying
What's her name again?
You should be ashamed
How could you treat her so unspeakably?
Or did you think she was a different girl?

For as the radio played in the bedroom wall
What was that name you called her?
Was she the one who took away your pride
And your reason?
Oh, why did you decide that
You'd punish any girl you meet
To try and make that feeling go away?

What's her name today?
What's her name today?
Is her hair hanging down?
Or maybe it's fixed with a ribbon

Are her eyes still blue?
Should she trust in you?
Because it's a lonely world
She wants to believe for a while in all the things you say

But as the radio played in the bedroom wall
What was that name you called her?
Isn't her smile reminiscent of someone else?
Well, is it or isn't it?
Oh, why did you decide that
You'd punish any girl you meet
To try and make that feeling go away?

What's her name today?
Is she going to stay
So you can ruin her?
And soon she'll be twisted in chiffon

Dress her like a doll
String her like a pearl
She hears peals of bells, but it's hard to tell
Now that she's hung up like a chandelier

What's her name?
What's her name?
What's her name today?",What's Her Name Today?,1998
