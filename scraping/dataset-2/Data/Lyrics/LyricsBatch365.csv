Holly Throsby,"Here we are
Stuck by this river
You and I
Underneath a sky that's ever falling down, down, down
Ever falling down

Through the day
As if on an ocean
Waiting here
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
I wonder why we came

You talk to me
As if from a distance
And I reply
With impressions chosen from another time, time, time
From another time",By This River,2007
Holly Tree Singers,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Holly Tree Singers,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2002
Holly Valance,"Laura and Tommy were lovers 
He wanted to give her everything 
Flowers, presents and most of all a wedding ring 
He saw a sign for a stock car race 
A thousand dollar prize it read 
He couldn't get Laura on the phone 
So to her mother Tommy said 

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her 
Tell Laura I may be late 
I've something to do that cannot wait 

He drove his car to the racing ground 
He was the youngest driver there 
The crowed roared as they started the race 
Round the track they drove at a deadly pace 
No one knows what happened that day 
How his car overturned in flames 
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck 
With his dying breath, they heard him say 

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her 
Tell Laura not to cry 
My love for her will never die 

Now in the chapel where Laura prays 
For her Tommy who passed away 
It was just for Laura he lived and died 
Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry 

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her 
Tell Laura not to cry 
My love for her will never die 
Tell Laura I love her 
Tell Laura I need her",Tell Laura I Love Her,2000

Yeah.
Oh.
Ah.

We met at work
And we played from the start
You were the DJ 
I was working in behind the bar
Our love was sudden
You were doing something right
You started seeing one out of sight

In the beginning (beginning)
When you were spinning (spinning)
It was my song you were playing
I was never saying
What I was feeling (feeling)
What words I dealing (dealing)
But I can't hold it back no more

'Cause I don't want to be friends
Baby you better know
What you I never know
You bring the light in both ends
Type of girl when you got a lot
One is not enough
City ain't big enough
Doctor, doctor
Give me something
So I can fight to the end, 'cause the
City ain't big enough
For both of us
Both of us
Both of us

Didn't want to turn it into a gap fight
But when the trouble it double
You won't like
I want to let it down and you came first
And if the bubble is about to burst

If you think that this is OK
You don't know what I'm about
And boy just wipe the smile off your face
You ain't that good at all anyway
And if you think that we're friends that way
You don't know what I'm about

Watch you
Take the floor
You move like no one I have ever seen
Ever seen before
A crush would be all right
But it's a bit more than that

You're with here
And baby she's with you
And yet I know it is all that

Say dreams are dreams alone
And I'll stay on my own
I will not let you near the feelings I may have
(You don't see the feelings that I have)
Say dreams are for the night
And I'll forget to lie
I'll hide this heart and never let you see inside
(No, you'll never have to see me sad)

They say that love at first sight
Does not exist
They say that you're over me
But I don't agree
With this
They say some things that seem to
Fill my head
Baby all I want's to hear someone say
It's so good I'm here instead

I want to boy who's genuine too

You're the kind that's always

Too much is not enough for you
You bet your life on strangle

Everything's a circle in itself
All as it should be

Have you stood inside a nightmare
Did it slap you in the face
Were you left to lose control
Did you ever find a way
Was it somebody that loved you, or a face you've never seen
So final, so quick are the hands of destiny

Always aching for the beauty of the visions in your head
Was it something that you wanted, only never had the guts
Now you stand ashamed and regret your giving up
Where would you be if you had tried
If you had given all you could...

There is someone out there watching every step you take today
Every struggle, all confusion, endless questions in your head

And we all are very fragile when there's nothing left to speak
When there's no one left to talk to, no more tears are left to cry
Will you stand up for the right thing or continue in denial
I don't know

Well, you know I'd love to help you, you know I'd love to heal
But without the hands of God, you will never be revealed
So, take off your mask of happiness, take off your mask of fame
We all know that you've got problems just like everybody's name

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
You know I'd love to think you were doing fine, but I'd be lying

So, don't tell me everything is good, don't walk on bitter ground
I have seen you at your worst, and I still love you when you're down
But I hate to see you live like this, I hate to see you crying
And I hate to see you tangled in her web of sex and lies
Do you have a god you pray to, do you have a god you love
Do you have some twisted fear about the will from up above
Do you wait for him in silence, do you wait for him in vain
Do you think some crazy fool is gonna preach your pain

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
Why do you cringe at the wake of every godly dream
While I watch you laughing on the brink of insecurity
You know I'd love to say you were doing fine, but I'd be lying

So, why must you walk with burdens much too big for you to bear
When you know it's not your fault
There are saints and sinners everywhere
You don't have to smile, I can read between your lines
I read guilt, and I read mercy, I read glory to the father
I read bitterness and suffering and love for all your children
I read brokenness inside your heart and scars too deep to see
I read pain from a young boy who's father left too early
Who's mother tried to mold him into what she'd love to be:

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
And why do you cringe at the wake of every godly dream while
I watch you laughin' on the brink of insecurity

With this confession I beg for more
I never mean to, and it's been awhile

I know it's wrong to hurt you like this
I know it's wrong to lie like a kid

Fire and blankets, a cheap parade
Of guilty pleasures, I take the stage
But nothing feels good if it ain't true
It's like trying to cry for someone you never knew
I know it's wrong to hurt you like this
I know it's wrong to lie like a kid

I love you with more tears than any pain could ever bring me
I fight it most everyday
I hurt you with more truth than your own eyes could ever teach you
I'm tired of living this way, when I know it's wrong

I never told you, you just kinda knew
By the way I'm not when I'm with you
You never take me like you used to
And nothing heals the scars of all the ones we never knew

But at least I got the courage to admit the crime
So don't come down on me
I'm still young, I'm trying to believe

Wait, I'll be fine
Just give me a couple years to say my prayers
I'm alive, you should keep that mirror for yourself

I'll only break your heart

I want you with a harsh desire
I crave you in the night
But I'm here to warn you
You're not safe with me

It haunts me like their pain

Holly Williams,"Love no more, I have got a prayer
I ask forgiveness everywhere
Devil unseen, please stop bothering me
I've got a broken man to repair

Brakes aren't working now
I'm trying to stop this train
Of desperation, loneliness and pain

Nothing's up ahead, the lights are supposed to be there
And you probably think I never cared
I hope to God one day you find some peace
With the memory of me

Now it's all in your head, and I'm the one at fault
Maybe I never loved you at all
I'd like to say I did, but I just don't know how
My heart could do the damage I allowed
The victim of my youth, the soldier of my dread
And I left all those tears in your bed
I hope to God one day you'll find some peace with the memory me

My potential is improving, my reckless days more calm
I know you won't believe me when I'm singing you this song
Damn, I wanted to please you, I just didn't have the will
I was never looking for someone to keep me still...
Now I see

So, if you pass this way again, if you feel the need
I'd love to hear the words that wait for me
But you don't need my sympathy, you're stronger than I think
I know you'll find your peace with the memory of me

With the wisdom of a thousand men before me
Wish I were a funny dream that haunted

I wish I was a fine wine

Sleeping symphony as I would lie awake
In the crevice of your shoulder soft and warm
That's where I miss your breathing

Black and pink and white
These are colors that remind me of the night
We fell on your steps and wished for all our lives
To be filled with such freedom

Picture perfect place
Painting shadows on the canvas of your face
Graceful rhythms in the frantic love we made
Moving underneath moonlight

Now looking at my mirror
The one you gave to me from the shop across the street
Where everything is rare
Just like your blue eyes
Just like your sad goodbyes
Just like the heartfelt letter that your mother mailed to you
Everything made me cry

So, here they come again
Haunting memories of you, they always win
Begging for a place to come alive again

Little did I know soon they would be
Lying right beside her, gone away from me

You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin

I wanna go and bounce the moon

Runnin' across the meadow

Never dreamed that I ever could forget You 
But black and white make a mess when it turn to grey 

Sunlight came sweepin' cross the window 
Rewind to the time when we were so close 
Got me longin' for yesterday 

But Lord You know me so well 
I can be a little punk sometimes 

But don't leave me, leave me alone 
Bust down the door to my heart like it's Your home 
Don't need no keys 
I'm on my knees 
Begging You please 
I've gotta settle this thing once and for all 
You got my heart my soul You can have it all 
I'm on my knees 
Beggin' You please 
Beggin' You please Lord, don't leave me alone

Don't leave me alone 
Through the tears, through the pain comes a new day 
Blown away still amazed You pursue me 
Ain't no limit to the way You love 

(Don't stop)Lord, I need You like a heartbeat 
(Concrete) rock-solid under my feet 
And You're callin' me, You're callin' me up 

Oh, 'cause You (You) know me (oh, You know me) so well (so well)
And I can be a little punk sometimes

So don't leave me, leave me alone

You got my heart, my soul, You can have it all 
I'm on my knees 
Beggin' You please 
Beggin' You please Lord, don't leave me alone

I said You had me in Your arms but I fell through the grasp 
But yep, I had You in my heart but I guess I relapsed 
Like I'm livin' for the wrong reasons, through the seasons 
Tryna fall for You but then they put me on blast 
It's like I try to speak my mind because I know that I'm His 
And yep I try to speak my mind but it don't fly with them kids 
Man, if I'm not talkin' bout the newest Nikes or releases 
They put the mute on me, I can't speak about my Jesus? 
Like I'm living for Him, I'm slippin to sin 
I turn around and make the amends
I try to fit it, I mess it up and stumble again 
I'm takin' this pen 
And writing everything so I remember just how sweet that it is 
Yeah man, I got issues, I can't even lie 
My only saving grace is knowing I got You inside 
I'm done with saving face, I don't got a thing to hide
So don't leave me alone, keep coming day and night 

Don't leave me, leave me alone 
Bust down the door to my heart, Lord it's Your home
You don't need no keys

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you

It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got

And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,

Do they know, do they care,
That it's only that I'm lonely, and low as can be,
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.

And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare,
So I go at a maddening pace,
And I pretend that it's taking her place,

You make me wanna run around,
Pulling my guns out and shit,
Your tempting me to run my mouth,
And call you out on this bitch,
How ignorant you gotta be,
To believe any of this,
You need to slit your wrist,
Get pissed and go jump off a bridge,

What? You can't see the
Sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What? You think I just got lucky
And didn't work for this shit?
Bitch. I've been working at
This ever since I was a kid,
I played a million empty shows
To only family and friends.

What kind of person can
Dis a band that deserves to get big?
I hate to be that person when
My verse comes out of the kid's lips.

That shits as worse as it gets.
This verse is over, I quit.

Santa's back up in the hood
So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck
It's Chanukah in Inglewood
The dreidles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah lets get drunk [x2]

J J J Just a little story about last Christmas
About some bad kids who were full of wishes
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin
Little Timmy stole from 7-11
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens
We drank in his room with some dude named Kevin
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents
Zack got caught with a bottle of jack
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack
So we took the beer back and I FUCKED HIM IN THE ASS!!!
It's Charlie Scene got egg nog in my flask
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped
Like oh my god is that saint nick
Kids give me your list like its the 25th
Been accused of being a bad kid
But I get presents as is
'Cause Mrs. Claus just myspace'd me
I blew off a date on Christmas eve.
So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice
You might still get a Rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice
So write your list and never have no fear
Have a Hollywood Christmas and an Undead new year!!!!
Fuck yeah!!!

bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls.
Good kids, bad and even Da Kurlzz.
We were chillin at home and deckin the halls.
So I checked my phone and Santa had called.
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve.
He said that his jolly ass needed some help.
He said Christmas ain't a gang but a way of life.
""if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife.""
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle,
Funnier than fuck you can ask Chris Kringle.
So we all took flight but something was fishy.
He asked for road head and started to kiss me.
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows.
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's.
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster.
It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter.
When we found out he started to pout.
I took my bandana and I choked him out.
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth.
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south.
I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest,
Met a lot of Jeff's but this one was shadiest.
When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch.
So if you don't like Christmas Fuck you bitch!!!

Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew.
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you

I've got nothing that's true

I wanna go home

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

I fuckin' swear that I care
But its hard when you stare
Into the bottom of a bottle
That is empty and bare
All my desolate soul
In my desolate home
It's my desolate role
Yeah I'm here all alone
I can't think of a reason
To get the fuck out of bed
Curtains closed, lights are off
Am I alive or dead?
I haven't shaved in a week
I always slur when I speak
Tolerance at its peak
Another fit just to sleep
Oh woe is me woe is me
I guess I need love
Hoes ya see hoes ya see
I'm just in a rut
And I swear I'm tryin' baby please
Baby don't leave
God-damn I'm a fuck-up
But I guess that's just me
So I sit in my room
And I'll cry in my bed
Thinkin' about all the shit
That made me wrong in my head
I keep tryin' to climb
But it seems so steep
Pour myself a fuckin' whisky

I watch my momma cry
She says 'baby why?'
I say 'baby died,
Baby's gone like a suicide'
I don't think you'll see him soon, mom
Stay out my room, mom
Tell daddy that I hate
That mother fucker like you, mom
I sing this shit for you, Danny, Sasha and Jordan
These beers keep gettin' warmer
Every time that I hold her
I pour this out for you
Like a partner in crime
It's part of the times
When you're sick in the mind
Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick
I'm so sick of this shit
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit
I'm so fucked up off it
So I stumble around
Til I stumble fall down
To this puddle of my tears
Layin' here on the ground

When you've got nothing left
You've got nothing left to lose
With my last left single breath
I'll still be singing to you
So when you bury me man
You better bury me deep
And sing along to this song
Because you're broken like me

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now

I was wrong all along

Come on down to the city of L.A

Hollywood Undead,"In a time of need only few can see what's wrong
Millions tend to crawl but only those who choose can make it through this all,

Only few can sing like lions 'cause we sing until we're gone
And we've got each others backs until we're back where we belong,

A woman held my shield and through the battle we did wrong,
A man who taught me wisdom through the static we recall,

And maybe when we' re gone our names will echo through the stars,
Every start's got it's ending even when we've learned to rise above it all,

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

I see you so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song
And then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

And we once also had a story too
You can see that good men only come in few.
Even in our greatest moments we may win or we may lose
Every song's got it's rules, you've got to learn to make it through

Maybe one day we can choose how it feels to be a woman or a man
Without rules but buried underneath there's a picture glued

So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth
Let these words strengthen all your views
Because these words were meant for you

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

I see you so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song
And then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

An' now I'm floatin' right above my coffin as it closes I look down
I see sigh as she's cryin on my moma's shoulder
I look up into the sky as the gates to heaven open somethin's wrong
Is this destiny or am I goin' home,

What will happen to my soul will I come back I don't know,
Will you meet me when its over let me know,
You can meet me here in heaven don't you ever let me go

This love this hate is burning me away

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

I see you so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song
And then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny

And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through,
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew.
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love struck, now I'm just fucked up,
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts

I can leave with my head down

From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying,
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

It's the end of the night
Get back to the bus
And get out of my life
'Cause I got people to see
Hoes as freaky as me
I roll it to the after party with my boy Charles P.
Picked up a few friends
Now I'm dippin' with bitches
Slapped the bitches to my right
I said click it or ticket
Girl feeling my ride
Now she's getting suspicious

This a brand new Miata
As I'm hittin' them switches
I ride behind Charlie
As he's poppin' a wheelie
I finally made it to the party
Now he's coppin' a feely
See Da Kurluzz out front doing tricks on his Heely's
Now I'm finna get down yelling somebody beer me

So chug this beer with me
Get drunk with Charlie Scene
Sense this urgency
'Cause I ain't tryna get drunk alone
So smoke this joint with me
Get high off Funny's weed
Sense this urgency
'Cause I ain't tryna get high alone

I roll up to the party in my Honda
Funny followed me in his Mazda Miata
Damn what a balla
Top down what a primadonna
The spinners that he bought
Straight outta auto zone for thirty dollars
Money we have nadda

Let's go inside I'll folla
They didn't let us in
So we hopped a
Wall but I dropped ya
That's when I lost ya
I didn't try ta call ya
I rain into a crowd of Celebrities and Papa-razzi and they shot a
Pictures of me and Dennis  Harper

Now I need a doctor
Yo little Jhon-ya
Crunk juice and Vodka
Is turning me into a monster
One more shot and imma gon-ah

But Charlie Scene I saw ya stick your dick in the salsa

I don't want no drama
I'd rather have my anaconda
Deep throated by Piranas

So takes these pills with me
Got 'em from J-D-O-G
Sense this urgency
Cause I don't wanna get high alone
So take this Ecstasy
They must be J3T's
Sense this urgency
Cause I ain't tryna get down alone

Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky lies the top the world
Til there's nothing left of her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Body doused in ash
With two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have
Is the police sketch of my mask
And its hardly time to ask
If you can save my heart for last

And its hard to face the facts
When the darkness fades to black
It's not just make believe
When they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines
In the air and make me breathe

So come on and grab your children
Look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage
They're killing by the millions
And billions of people die
For a lost cause

So now I pray for my nation
That's destroyed under god

(It's the end of the world)
All my battles have been won
But the war has just begun

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch the city burn away

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Till the skies bleed ashes
And the fuckin' sky crashes

We make ashes just with matches
To ignite the flame
And all the hopes of the youth
Deemed fuckin' insane

Take the pill
And go get drunk
And go get killed
Double dose
As in life as in death
Breathing till there is no breath

I will not die in the night but in the light
Of the sun and the ashes
Of this world in my lungs

But who am I to say
Lets all just run away
Go grab your friends and pray
We're gonna rule the world today

It's the end of the earth
We've been done since our birth

(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
Dot the streets with corpses

We watch the city fuckin bleed

I am trying to be
What you're dying to see

Can't take this, anymore,
This heart, break this.""

How could he just forsake us?

Breaks us he makes us
Hate us he gave us
Nothing but no trust
And I am so fucked up
So let this gun bond us
Let's hide by this lust
And once we are just dust
He'll know that he loved us

Let it all burn
I will burn first
God I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.
God I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?

So take me and make me
Weakened and save me
This hate that you gave me
Keeps saying the same thing

To sing when you hurt
And to sing when you cry
To sing when you live
And to sing when you die

And here at the end
At the end of the hurt
All the pain ain't the same
When it's your turn to burn
We're the heart for the heartless,
The thoughts for the thoughtless,
The eyes for the eyeless
We're the gods of the godless!

Let it all burn

Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.

When it's all gone,
Sing me this song

So cry 3 tears for me,
When it's all gone,
When it's all gone

I can not stand
Who I am I'm this man
With this blood on my hands
In this blood I am damned
So watch my wings burn
As they burn in the fire
I'll scatter the ashes
No need for the choir

Let it all burn
I will burn first

Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.

You thought these streets were paved in gold
But their dirty and dark

Been to hell
I can show you the devil!
Down you fell
Can't hold yourself together!
Soul to sell
Down here you live forever!
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares!
Been to hell

Down you fell

Soul to sell
Down here you live forever!
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares!
Nightmares!
Welcome!

In the belly of the beast, I'm a wolf amongst the sheep,
At the bottom of the hill, but at the top of the street
Above the boulevard, schoolyard, victim of deceit
And you're runnin' hard, but this wolf is always at your feet
And you've seen it all before, but the wolf's outside your door
And you're old enough to run, you ain't hiding anymore
Another victim of the star spangled banner of the street
Now you're in the world of wolves
And we welcome all you sheep

Been to hell
I can show you the devil!
Down you fell
Can't hold yourself together!
Soul to sell
Down here you live forever!
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares!
Been to hell

Soul to sell
Down here you live forever!
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares!
Nightmares!
Welcome!

You need to wake up and face it,
So you can taste my reality
Now you're stuck in this place you hate,
And you came here so happily
Then it made you lose your faith,
And that's what fucked with your sanity
Say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity
Hollywood is your friend, and the undead are your family
We'll take you to the edge, and turn your regret into agony
And I'll never let you go, 'cause I know you'll come back to me
I'm the reason you came here
I'm the American tragedy

Been to hell
I can show you the devil!
Down you fell

The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone.

Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again,
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends,
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends,
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin,
I'm twenty stories up, yeah I'm up at the top,
I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off,
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,
I bet my momma found my letter, now shes calling the cops,
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance,
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent,
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,
I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,
I never bought a suit before in my life,
But when you go to meet god, you know you wanna look nice.

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.

My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.

We hit the sky, there goes the light,
No more sun, why's it always night
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream,
When you can't dream, well, whats life mean?
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die,
A Mother and a Son and someone you know,
Smile at each other and realize you don't,
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised,
What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay?
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say,
Now Momma feels guilt, yea Momma feels pain,
When you were young, you never thought you'd die,
Found that you could but too scared to try,
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly.

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.

My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.

I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,

Oh I might just try,

Someday, someday

Down in the dirt
With your blood on my hands
I blacked out
But now I do understand
That you were too good
For this world so you left it
Everything turned red
And then you made an exit

That pass you by

And put some blood on my knees

To the sky and the rest

Come lay down beside me

It's only what I've seen
It's only just one dream

Whenever you need to find me
Bitch, you can send me a letter
Forever drunk and disorderly
All this vodka I'm pouring me
Goddamn, and I want it all
My city of glory

When the sun goes down
The stars come out like the ghost of yesterday
So drink 'em down
'Cause some things never change
Baby, sing and get loud
We ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down
Let me hear you say
This is my town
(It's my town!
It's my town!
It's my town!)
This is my town
(It's my town!
It's my town!
It's my town!)
This is my town

The streets you walk give you a reason
'Cause it's all you got
And that'll never change
So keep singing that song
And we can live forever
Pour a little out for the ones who passed away

When the sun goes down

Hollywood Undead,"Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

I wake up right about the mid-afternoon,
With the sun in the sky but nights coming soon,
I walk to the mirror just to fix myself,
Yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else,
So I pick my pills from the counter drawer,
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor,
I guess I'm a man of no recourse,
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse,
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me,
I swear I used to be what I truly believe,
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part the seas,
So

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

People get sick and they watch you bleed,
When you fall from the top, boy you better believe,
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need,
Well at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea,
Then we stop and we look up to the sky,
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why?
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say,
Our knees are getting tired,
Too tired to pray,
That's when we laid down into the road,
We all seem to walk and I guess walking alone,
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased.

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

Time just seems to go on and on,
On and on,
And on and on,
Life inside a bottle all alone,
All alone,
The bottles gone,
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased,
Whats life inside a bottle if it's cold?
One more song and I'm finally free,
I'll meet you here in heaven, between the sea,
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased.
So

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

With some tears on my pillow and this blood on my knife
And my soul has stained these sheets but they pull up to the side
Who's blood could this be is it yours or is it mine
Take the knife and twist it wheres my heart she missed it
And you know I don't wanna die but baby you insisted
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have
My heart just keeps on beating and its more than you can stand
Baby please just tell me how we ever went so wrong
We used to sing together and we used to sing a song
We could never sing forever because now my voice has gone
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along

I can see blood all over my hands

Whats it all worth how much can you stand
The longer you stay close to me the further I ran

I tried to treat you equally and listen to your reasoning
But you waited so eagerly while plotting and deceiving me
You came behind me secretly and shattered every piece of me
I had nothing to give so I gave you my life,
You didn't wanna see me live so you gave me your knife,
Did it hurt as you tiptoed coming from behind,
You took away my kids so I guess you killed me twice,
Drag me into the night cos its the one thing you keep,
You knew that I had to die so you could finally sleep,
There's blood all over your knife you know you've  burned yourself,
And its a matter of time before you burn in hell,

Whats it all worth
How much can you stand
The longer you stay close to me the further I ran

Wont you hold me lure me more so tell me course nor
Weaving slowly oh wont you hold me

And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell, but it's getting real dark see
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath you're breathing when I breathe
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go

Instead, I'm left to fall
'Cause the longer I'm away,
I'll always stay the same
Lookin' back, when I thought I knew it all
Instead, I'm left to fall
Did I throw it all away?

I can't believe
That when I breathe
That there's something good inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
So close to me
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
Yeah

Don't you know, little boy, They'll lay you to waste, man
Little do they know, every song is a lifespan
Yeah, they've taken one, but I'm takin' my last chance
To hold all we know and let go with both hands
Though, don't you know that plots are made from concrete
Right through the stone, can you hear my heart beat?
Beats through my bones, like no memory left me
Not for a second or a minute when I dream
I wanna go home, like a home that I'll keep
You can dig six or sixty-six feet
We can live forever, still your misery missed me
Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey
Look into the mirror, and the lines that time drew
Seen 'em painted white in the eyes that shine through
My heart beats heavy in an open chest
And, I wanna say goodbye, but there's nobody left

I can't believe
That when I breathe
That there's something good inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
So close to me
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
Yeah

I broke it all, and I put to the test
Put your hands in mine, and feel this emptiness
There's no beat in my chest
'Cause there's nothin' left
No, it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress
What's another dream?
You could hardly sleep
Can you believe bad things only happen to me?
God knows one day, you will finally see
That's scares will heal, but we're meant to bleed
Do you realize I would lie for you?
Please out my last breath, I would die for you
I know I'm no good, but my heart beats true
You know I'm gonna fight, though I must be scared to lose
You took me in, and I fucked it up again
And an empty promise, no, I won't pretend
'Cause in the end, we need someone to solve 'em
Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem

I can't believe
That when I breathe
That there's something good inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
So close to me

Of that one good thing inside of me

Getting hot so I play in the snow
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things
See the dead on the cover of a magazine
See my smile, it was born from amphetamines
Better duck 'cause it's war on my enemies

Do you see a lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be
How can I sleep at night there's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion, and you are dead

Heres a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I don't need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words, all I can say
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You where born a lion and a lion you will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be

Remember an army of all those little kids
Livin' life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle-end
I'd rather die then watch you givin' in
I'm sorry daughter but you're fathers not the same
I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I say you can hide
Beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain
After all only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once you walk away
Promise me that you'll love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all the things that these lions never gave
The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tearin' out the pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Hey! I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I'll ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home

Who left me outside
I'm bent, I'm not broken
Come live in my life

Are the pages I write
On my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight
Hold me tonight

Welcome to the world and all the land in it was wasted
The blood upon your hands and the wickedness that made it
Sing or scream it all and the memories keep fading
See the exit wound, dear God what have we taken?
Guess I'll say a prayer and I'll kiss into the air
I'll look into the sky, send them straight to nowhere
We all dug the grave, can't shake away the shame
Quiver in the sky but you're shaken all the same
You left us with the guns and all of them unloaded
Teach us how to shoot but you taught us how to hold them
All the weight of all the world is right between your shoulders
Heavy is the heart when the world keeps growing colder

Did you come to say your goodbyes to this life?

People say I'm pissed off
'Cause I like to shit talk
But people are fake
So wait till their jaws lock
Tick-a-ti-tick tock
The click of the wrist watch
Time is running out
On my way to the tip-top
So fuck it I can't stop
Been waiting for too long
Started my own plot
It's starting with this song
Damned if I'm damn wrong
Who wants to fight a lion?
Motherfuckers who hate
Just wait for me to die trying
Like I'm gonna stop now
Like I'm gonna cop out
Show these motherfuckers
I ain't willing to drop out
So maybe I'm pissed off
Because I feel ripped off
This industry is a bitch
And she'll rip your dick off
Famous and broke

You want a dove or something
So I started to run
And just kept on gunning
Dark heart, dark thoughts
In a blacked out room
Macked out, Cadillacs
Click-clack, ka-boom
Sung you a song
The words went right through
And I can't haunt a house
If it haunts me too
So let's draw the line
And it's me and it's you
I do it all the time
And Johnny three don't lose
Can you write some checks that you can't cash?
So I'm a little bitter, baby, keep on coming back
Yeah, there's just some things that I can't stand
A little trigger-happy, so come on, let's dance
Yeah, fuck your virtue
Your lie and your meaning
With the writing on the wall
But you just can't read it
Comes back around
Man, you better believe it
If you got a dark heart
I'm gonna motherfucking bleed it

Pissed off with two Glocks
With a forty in his fist
And a fifth of moon rocks
Got his sleeves cut off
With marijuana tube socks
Smoking pot in the drop-top
Bumping Kid Rock
I'mma smoke another spliff
And chase it down with six shots
That guy's cockier than shit
Like a guy with six knocks
And I can't stop saying dick
Dick, dick and then cock
Hick-a-dickery-dick-a-dick-a-dickery-dock
So talk shit and get socked
Or kick rocks and get lost
Or get dropped and get topped
This hip-hop shit gets hot
This is not a pit stop
And I'm not gonna stop
Until I'm on the top
Like your mom on a cop
So when you see me in your hood
Yeah, you better think twice
Let me give you all a muy poquito piece of advice
If you push me any further
It's the end of your life

Better run, here we come

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking
Born with a soul that don’t wanna be saved
Every time I look around I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they digging up my grave

I’m not afraid to die, let the good book witness

It’s like I magically happened to be the phantom that cannot be
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly
While you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag
I see you all laughing so happily
It’s okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I’ll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I’ve already started, there ain’t no saving your heart
This is the day of the dead, this is ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it’s hard to swallow
When I’m done, I ain’t done, 'cause it’s hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow,

Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It’s the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come

When the ashes start to rise
And the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry
On the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It’s the day of the dead

I miss my friend I miss him so
I say my prayers, I raise my hands
I move my feet and when I can
I said help, would you help me now?
And lift me up if my legs give out?

Wake up, enough's enough
I sold my soul for tainted love

Let go, oh
Love isn't good enough
Let go, oh

What was hidden right behind?
Sometimes fear can leave you blind
Yeah God forsake the ones who make
The temped heart go out and break them
Vicious now, fucking vicious now
Some remember every story
Every inch between the lonely
Every voice that ever told me
Only one could ever hold me
Felt it in between, I remember when I dream
But you're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now

Let go, oh

Let go, oh

It's true
Dark hearts don't break, they bruise
Fuck love, fuck you
I'm dying just to hurt you too

Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else

By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself

One more shot then it's time to roll
Smoke these crops and I'm out the door
Chug some rock, but I sip Patron
Hit that spot till you lose control
You died? I'll go out alone
Bitch, you must be out your dome
Fresh new kicks, I cut the floor
Ludicrous, I throw them vogues

Funny on-point, his joke's cracking
Grind on the wall just to get some action
Looking in the mirror like I'm Michael Jackson

I get more pussy than a bowl of Friskies
I roll so low, can't keep up with me

Who, at the same time, is such a sweetie
So when everybody else is being such a puss
Doesn't mean you can straight get off the hook
I don't need another partner to shake my tush
I can party all night and slay some bush
So I'mma go out and do some thrashing
Show everybody what the fuck is cracking
'Cause this motherfucker can do some damage
If you don't think so, you can suck my package
'Cause I don't need no static when I feed my habits
So don't be combatant when I wreak some havoc
From this weed I'm having, where's my keys, goddamnit?
I should be on half of me and three's on taxing
On my knees, I'm blacking out, I need some action

Put the half smoked blunt and some blood on my lip
Hit up the brain for that Mary Jane
Man, all she had left was ménage à trois
Rolled in the pink I picked up some Cuervo
Walking sideways and I'm starting to swerv-o
Last night was wild put my money a jumbos
Wine and dine, tig ol' bitties and bimbos
Hollywood rap pack, cans in my back pack
Cruise through your valley and I'm snatchin' your snapback
Huffin' on some paint and I think that I'm half black
Roll another blunt and fuck it up over this track

Dumping all these motherfuckers deep in the DeSoto
Oh no, tell me whatcha wanna be

Hollywood Undead,"Why the fuck do I keep feeling like I lost my shit?
It’s like I should just give up because I’m not legit
It’s like I got a chain wallet and some frosted tips
Sometimes I wanna grab a fucking gun and swallow it
It's like pulling teeth for me to give a compliment
That's why I walk into your circle, and I talk some shit
I'm sure you tell all of your friends that I'm a monster prick
Man, I wish that guy would take a hike and chomp a dick
And I can't stop any of these evil thoughts
And I never thought I would ever be so lost
Make these bad thoughts go away, they need to stop
And if I keep sobbing like a bitch, I'll need a mop
It's like my mind's a broken record, make it go away
And I keep telling myself that I'll be okay
But something negative is all I ever seem to think
So I guess I'll just get down on my knees and pray

Well, I know I should be moving on
But I feel like I'm already gone
Now if somebody'd hold me, save me from
This broken record that's playing in my heart

Back in the beginning, can't remember who I was
But I know I was a kid, I would dream just because
And I don't remember giving in or ever giving up
But I guess that's what I did 'cause I guess I had enough
And I look in this mirror, and I see this reflection
It always smiles back but I know it's deception
Medicated smile with these desperate intentions
Dreaming of that kid and his soul's resurrection
Two pages, not enough pens, not enough pages
To explain away this fucking hatred
Bet his own life, wishing someone could save him
Save me, please, I can't seem to take this
Stories tucked in my notebook
But I won't ever read 'em 'cause I'm too afraid to look
Back on the wrong side of those tracks
'Cause if I ever do I might not come back

Well, I know I should be moving on
But I feel like I'm already gone
Now if somebody'd hold me, save me from
This broken record that's playing in my heart

You know it's alright, I'm praying for the sunshine
To get me through the hard times, to get me through the hard times
You know it's alright, I'm praying for the sunshine

To shoulder against the glacial? Tree

Holopaw,"They dream impossible dreams of loquat seeds (gold flecked and slippery), 
And clipper ships pitched on sea foam green,
Hibiscus reds and you and me.

We kicked a new path back to the St. Marie past snowmen quiet and listening. 
Brightly colored birds flitted past their coal-for-eyes. I took it for a twinkle. 

If they could have held all that you said
In their densely mitten packed cold, 
Then words would have fallen out come Spring like spoons and pistols 
And pots and pans 
And train wrecks and splitshots and marching bands.

And canaries light on corncob pipes 
And would not look so bright
If not so cold.

They dream impossible dreams
Of bitter sweet brevity
And standing at the foot of Niagara Falls 
And buck and doe
And chief and squaw
And the path we kicked back to St. Marie past snowmen,
Quiet and listening. 
Canaries tracing loopholes against the gray,
You took it for a tangle. 
You took me for a tangle.

And would not look so bright
If not so cold.",Took It for a Twinkle,2003

Holy Cow,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Holy Fuck,"It's not a solid, not a soft thing, to pull the wool up like a smoke screen
Nobody does it like a prophet, it's gone before you know you lost it
There are reasons you keep your hands tied, there's certain things you shouldn't have tried
So if you gotta tell me something, you better go from the beginning

We all forget to sleep, and crash at someone's feet
Everybody skips a beat
We let the chances pass, the few we held so fast
Everybody breaks a glass

And here I'm standing in the middle, not just a little but a hill full
Wondering how I got a head cold, wishing I didn't know what I know
It's never been about the money, we're worthy or we are not worthy
However much you got on your plate, you're as good as you reciprocate

We all pretend to keep our tongue out of our cheek
Everyone's the fool they seek
We all go off the track, and feel for our way back
Everybody breaks a glass
Everybody breaks a glass

Shook
Scared to look
At peers when they peer back
It's weird how we fear that

It's weird how we wear masks
It appears that we fear our own tears
More than tear gas
My team's struggling in years past

Looking to draft beers
To bring cheers back
But when the drinking game's finished
No Guinness just a clear glass

Seeing our real image mirrored back
The places that we go to cope
It's so strange
When we're older folks

It don't change
Trying to hang, we don't know the ropes
When we fall, we got more than our shoulders broke
It's no game

It's why we overdose on cocaine
Get our brains comatose, there's no blame
If you've ever know shame
Known pain

Known days when it really don't feel okay

Somewhere perfection lies, but not for you and I
Everybody trips some time
When cities fall like shacks, walls eventually crack
Everybody breaks a glass",Everybody Breaks a Glass,2011

But it's something I would like to do

Today I will pay that bill and I will, to find you gone

Is that the demon you are running for?

My heart therefore feels like it's tattoed
With all the thoughts which came from you
You feel okay, I'm still alone
I have to take care of that danger zone

You cried so long like a huge lost child
You're digging for the answer worldwide
You wonder while they understood you wrong
Why you can't get it on

You told me the secrets of your life
But now you guard them like a lie
I have to cut your pictures on the wall
Before your smile lets me rise and fall

I would like and liked to be at your side
In all your secrecy, allowing your destiny
Within your dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
And fight for your screams in dignity, far away from agony

Far away from agony, when you feel free
But you forced my soul with needles, soul with needles, soul with needles
Turned your lightning down on low
And my love to you has to go like the snow

It's been a while since I felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye?
Ohh, I will miss you, just go away
Unbound the feeling we just had today

Where wild storms dwell
When loosened elements are tightened by a dream
When I must feel this way
When life has to be changed

I give it to you, my love
I break your neck for my thoughts

There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above
I open gates of hell

Thunder roars from the crowd
I follow my advice without any kind of lies
I die to stay that way
Much more than I can say
I was young when it infected me

Amps are roaring, power chords clash
Our razor blade edge, hammer the wizard
Double-bass pounds for the metal blizzard
Wring your ax to bomb the hall
Blood on my my string, until I fall

Princess of hell, it's my decay
Princess of hell, for your body to smell

Embracing thoughts that bring us pain
Desperate eyes seek in vain
Through the eyes of innocence
See the smile of youth again

With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out

Hombres G,"La mitad de todo lo que digo 
Es un truco que aprendí 
Es buscar un poco el sentido 
A lo que tú quieres oír

Pero la otra mitad, la tienes tú 
Y desde un mar de niños nos llamas 
Oh, Dulce Belén 

Oh, Dulce Belén tú no tenías por qué 
Aún se te encendía la cara 
Dibujando una sonrisa 
Pero estoy tan triste qué 
Me siento a un piano 
Y sin tener ni idea toco algo

Algo que no entiendo 
Que me está robando la razón 
Que me acerca hasta tus ojos 
Tenías que haber dicho que no 
Y es algo que no entiendo

Hombres G,"Siempre me he preguntado
Por qué la gente se queda aquí. 

Quizás no haya otro sitio 
Que sea mejor para vivir. 

Nos gusta amontonarnos 
Dentro de los bares 
Para tomarnos la cerveza 
Afuera en la calle. 

Y es que Madrid
No tiene mal pero sí. 

Hablando de chicas 
O estando con chicas 
Vivimos todos aquí 
Y aunque hablamos más que estamos 
No nos cansamos de mentir 
Y no hay que olvidar
¡Que yo soy de Madrid

Y ya sé que ya lo he dicho 
En alguna otra canción
Es cierto que las estrellas 
Se ven en muy rara ocasión

Los coches echan humo 
Como en todas las ciudades 
Pero nadie se resigna 
A no pasear por la calle

Y este Madrid
Sigue siendo diferente
Y lo mejor que hay aquí, 
Es que está lleno de gente

Y ya sé que la verdad
Es que no soy nada imparcial 
Y no puedo negar
¡Que yo soy de Madrid! 

Y sé lo que digo
Tú vente conmigo 

Porque de Madrid 
No se me ocurre nada más 
Qué te podía yo decir 
Que no hayas oído ya 
Sobre esta hermosa ciudad 
Y no hay que olvidar 
¡Que yo soy de Madrid! 

En esta pequeña 
Ciudad gris 
Todos se quieren divertir 
Y no hay que olvidar 
¡Que yo soy de Madrid!","Madrid, Madrid",1989

Que tira un vaso o rompe un jarrón, 
Me hago el amable ofreciendo gazpacho,

A tu padre en el pantalón. 

No tengo un duro ni tampoco lo valgo, 
Llevo unos años en pecado mortal, 
No soy bajito ni tampoco muy alto, 
Y reconozco que soy un animal, 
En potencia sexual. 

Ya sé que yo a ti 
No te gusto nada, 
Y quiero que sepas 
Que tú a mí me encantas, 
No podré vivir sin ti. 

Porque me gustas, tú lo sabes, 
Y aunque te parezca extraño 
Nos caeremos muy bien, 
Y hasta podríamos, quizá casarnos 
¡Quién sabe! 

Ya es un poco tarde 
Podíamos irnos a alguna parte 
Donde estemos solos 
Y poder contarte 

Que tú me gustas, ya lo sabes 
Cuando entraste por la puerta me tembló el corazón, 
Y algo me dijo, tú me gustas, 
Tú me gustas,

Con sus libros y despertadores 
Puestos a distinta hora.

Estoy sentado afuera junto a la pared 
Hay una chimenea algunas tazas de café

El mundo en el bolsillo pequeño de mi pantalón 
Pero hace tanto tiempo que no he visto el mar 
Que a veces tengo ganas de llorar 
Hace frió aquí fuera… tápame

He's not good just once in awhile; He's good all the time. {Repeat Chorus} Now we've all had friends who've let us down. You know what I'm talking about; At the very first sign of trouble, they're nowhere to be found. Well, Jesus stays when others go; He'll never leave your side, He's your friend in stormy weather 'cause He's good all the time. {Repeat Chorus} Well, He's the one you call in the middle of the night when your body moans with pain. Don't worry about that wayward child, 'cause He heard you call his name. He'll put food in your kitchen when you don't have a dime. He's not good just now and then, He's good all the time. , {Repeat Chorus 2 Times} {Tag} You can search the whole world over, no greater friend you'll find.

To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

I'll walk with joy to know my debts are paid.
I know my name is clear before my Father; 
I am His child and I am not afraid.
So, greatly pardoned, I'll forgive my brother;
The law of love I gladly will obey.

I then shall live as one who's learned compassion.
I've been so loved, that I'll risk loving too.
I know how fear builds walls instead of bridges;
I'll dare to see another's point of view.
And when relationships demand commitment,
Then I'll be there to care and follow through.

Your Kingdom come around and through and in me;
Your power and glory, let them shine through me.

And may Your living Kingdom come in me.

And may You feed a hungry world through me.

Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,

Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

Woken by his mother and she had just this to say 
My son please return to me safe and ok you only turned
18 five months ago this may
Into the chopper his soul climbed aboard
Dressed up all in green with the cross of the lord
He will soon be revealed to this violence and sin
Brought by his country to protect and to defend
He looked to the sky and pictured it way back when
Will I return the same boy or a man without friends

Lead into those trees
The ones that stood oh so tall
We gave the government our fees
And Mr. Nixon took it all
To pay off all the plumbers that broke right through that wall
Well that was then and this is now Together as we fall

Now this boy comes back just looking to the crowd
Who once was his friend but now is not allowed
To be with all the killers in society today
Given off this feeling Billy was betrayed
Crying to his mother just like he had done before
Forced to see the bed that left behind the door
Pushed to shoot, shoot aim and kill
It was burned into his mind and soon it was a thrill
Now this boy comes back reaching to his chest
Looking for the love of god that he had put to rest
Now I lay myself down to sleep
I shall pray the lord to myself to keep 
And if I die before I wake
I wish I could give back all the souls I had to take
Please set me free
On free to live this place
This manhood? That was given underneath those trees, those trees.

We learned to make sparks by rubbing sticks together

And I was mad because me mother sent me up here ha-ha-ha

that I feel in my heart for you

Paradise to live

Homer Haynes,"When I was walking down the street, a billboard caught my eye.
The advertisement written there would make you laugh and cry.
The sign was torn and tattered from the storm the night before,
And as I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Smoke Coca-Cola cigarettes. Drink Wrigley's Spearmint beer.
Ken-L-Ration dog food makes your wife's complexion clear.
Chew chocolate-covered mothballs -- they're sure to satisfy.
Brush your teeth with Lifebuoy soap and watch the suds go by.

When I recovered from the sock, I went along my way.
I'd gone no further than a block, when there to my dismay,
Another billboard caught my eye, just like the one before,
As I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Take your next vacation in a brand-new Frigidaire.
Learn to play piano in your winter underwear. 
Simonize your baby with a Hershey's candy bar,
And see the difference that Drano makes in all the movie stars!

Doctors say that babies shouldn't smoke 'til they are three.
People over 35, take baths in Lipton Tea.
Oh, you can make America a better place today --
Just buy a copy of this song and throw it far away!",The Billboard Song,1997

My it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'?
I guess that I'm doin' fine

It's been so long now and it seems
Now it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that
You'd love him till the end of time

Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town

But remember what I tell
In time you're gonna pay
It's surprising how time slips away

Ain't it funny how time slips away

Homer Simpson,"I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself

There I go, here I go, where I go, I don't know
I just can't help myself, so
Why do I do, what I do, when I do
Well, I can say so or I just don't know

Boys will be boys and what they usually say
That's the how and the why, that I act this way
That's the end of the line, I run out of rhyme
That ain't no crime so it's milk it out time

Let's see, I know it's some cosmic force
Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess
Well, ha, I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A very great lady, once said it right
A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but
I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health
What's the hey, I can't help me

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Pompeya y, más alla, la inundación,
tu melena de novia en el recuerdo,

tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjon
y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
que me llena de nuevo el corazón.

Sur... una luz de almacen...
Ya nunca me veras como me vieras,
recostado en la vidriera
y esperandote,
ya nunca alumbrare con las estrellas

por las noches de Pompeya.
Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
y mi amor en tu ventana
todo ha muerto, ya lo se.

San Juan y Boedo antiguo, cielo perdido,
Pompeya y, al llegar al terraplen,
tus veinte años temblando de cariño
bajo el beso que entonces te robe.

arena que la vida se llevo,
pesadumbre del barrio que ha cambiado
y amargura del sueño que murio.

Homero Prado,"Rodeada de amigas te encontrabas
La tarde que frente a ti pasaba
Con tristeza oí que te decían
Que baja está cayendo tu mirada

Yo sé que mi cariño haz despreciado
Mil hombres te ofrecen sus riquezas
Yo solo un corazón casi postrero
Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza

Las nubes por el cielo van llorando
Las aves van cantando mi tristeza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas

Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas
Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza

Ya casi no recuerdo quien me dijo
Cuidado no vayas a humillarte
Tal vez fueron palabras de mi madre
Palabras de un cariño
Que no podía engañarme

Collares de perlas te habrán dado
Dinero y amor según parece
Yo espero que el espejo te defraude
Al fin que la pobreza no envejece

Las nubes por el cielo van llorando
Las aves van cantando mi tristeza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas

Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas
Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza
