Feven,"""Down here on the ground"" [x2]

[Diaz]
This is not those two DJ's, not Touch, not Wop
Not that skinny bitch Cameron although she's hot
Not those brothers Tony, wanted to pop me in that movie
Now I'ma claim that name, Diaz, y'all can sue me
Any beat given to me, shit, I'll close it down
In and out the booth, hot like we supposed to sound
Now who holds the crown? Yo let's split it four ways
I'm always, gonna be Spain and Norway

[Petter (RZA)]
Slicka upp sparka ner dessa katter blir fler
för dessa snubbars problem
jag silar snacket på scen
det är vad dom säger när jag har gått
vad dom skriver på sitt nät
hur jag lät, hur jag var
vad jag sa, var jag bra
var jag keff, var jag deff
Var jag aight, var jag tight
var jag nice, var jag bajs
var jag ingenting alls
var jag kung, var jag tung
(Fuck that shit)
om du inte diggar min stil man
(Nigga, fuck that shit)

[RZA]
Don't fuck with my money, son, don't fuck with my bitch
Don't fuck with my lab and don't fuck with my whip
Don't fuck with my jewels, my weed or my dip
Or I might get the glock, son, and fuck with this clip
Blast off the Remingtons, steel shots got you tremblin'
Runnin' so fast you lost the tree off the Timberland's
Flamed from the heat I squeeze, feel the adrenaline
And we could bust shots like we cowboys and Indians

[Feven]
Yo
Let the world witness some real shit 'bout to go down
RZA program, N.Y. mixed with Europe sound
When it's laid, history already made
We broke gates across waters, across lands, across borders
Remember my name F-to the E-V-E-N
Tell ya crew, tell ya school, tell ya next to kin
In act two, this is my chance to blast thru
And my crew G-F-X, yeah remember that too

""Down here on the ground"" [x4]

[RZA]
Nigga-nigga-nigga what?
Down here on the ground, we fuck niggaz up
We break shit down, yo look

The God Rzarec' is known breakin' Gucci specs
Magnetic attraction to wizzes keep their coochie wet
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I'm a super-nova
Controller of the lunar and polar, German luger holders
Best to back the fuck up, my mag buckin' up
The slugs could stop Mack trucks so don't act up
Fatal guillotine carrier blast like the space harrier
Sip of the blackberry, Berry I might marry ya

[Diaz]
There's a lot of shit that separates y'all from me
I'm in touch with the streets, they reply to me
If I'm needed by my people there's no why in me
A real fighter, maybe there's a young Sly in me
I'm like that Spanish Rocky, attitude a bit cocky
Me around ya girl, y'all could guess where that cock be
Well it's not in my pants, not in my hands
Y'all could look at it like, I make her hot in advance

[Petter]
Jag ser ett finger I ett publikhav
vi tar till publikhat
det är alltid likadant, hör ditt prat I publikhav
jag klarar mig själv
fixar mitt shit själv
slashar mitt shit väl
drar in cash varje kväll
ständigt aktuell 100 decibel, debil, ikväll
gå på scen I ett svart klädesställ
jag är som en grogg utan virke, bara ren jävla stil
jag är som en hundra formel ett, fast I en jävla bil

[Feven]
Let me bring more, spit more, kick more shit
I'ma hit more, stick more than Clark on Dick
I'm a bit more sharper than Bronco whips
You talkin' this, don't underspeed the Miss that's killin' this

Fever Ray,"When I grow up
I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dark eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never liked a sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet and cry for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I wait for him to catch me

Waiting for you to embrace me",When I Grow Up,2009
Fever Ray,"He came back one day and
Told me stories that I now dream of
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Open atmosphere
Take me anywhere
Take me there
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

We have water mouth
Sand in pockets and a strained household
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

When the night falls
There is fire in the bungalow

Lay back with a big cigar
Lay back we are where we are
Lay back with a big cigar
Lay back this is where we are",Coconut,2009
Fever Ray,"I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm

Eyes are open the mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer
Eyes are open the mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer

I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm

In my arms she was so warm

Oh, how I try
I leave the TV on and the radio

Fever Ray,"Never leave me
Walk close beside me
Your hand my hand
Fits so easy

No tomorrow
Let us stop here
We did some great things
Didn't we?

Dry and dusty
I am a capsule of energy
You speak softly
We are capsules of energy

Work as I've been told
In return I get money
Small feet in the hall
And I long for every moment",Dry and Dusty,2009
Fever Ray,"So, I lost my head a while ago
But you seem to have done no better
We set fire in the snow
It ain't over, I'm not done

Some do magic, some do harm
I'm holding on, holding on
I'm holding on to a straw

Who is the Alpha? What is made of cloth?
How do you say you're sorry?
And there's nothing to be afraid of

Is it dark already? How light is a light?
Do you laugh while screaming?
Is it cold outside?

One thing I know for certain
I'm pretty sure, it ain't over
I'm not done",I'm Not Done,2009

If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings

Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
If I had a voice, I would sing

Dangling feet from window frame

Fever Ray,"Memory comes when memory's old 
I am never the first to know 
Following the stream up North 
Where do people like us float 

There is room in my lap 
For bruises, asses, handclaps 
I will never disappear 
For forever, I'll be here 

Whispering 
Morning, keep the streets empty for me
Morning, keep the streets empty for me 

I'm laying down, eating snow 
My fur is hot, my tongue is cold 
On a bed of spider web 
I think of how to change myself 

A lot of hope in a one man tent 
There's no room for innocence 
So take me home before the storm 
Velvet mites will keep us warm 

Whispering 
Morning, keep the streets empty for me 
Morning, keep the streets empty for me 

Whispering

And eyelash
Reappear
In a flash
Now's the only
Time I know

Early morning's
Greatest deed
What's forsaken
I do not need

There is water
There is snow

Settling down
Door and room
Keep it tidy
Keep it like home
Now's the only
Time I know

Come here sparrow
Watch my hand
Black and blue seeds

There is more

And drive around

Through the water
Through the snow",Now's the Only Time I Know,2009
Fever Ray,"I've got a friend
Who I've known since I was seven
We used to talk on that phone
If we have time, if it's the right time

Accompany me
By the kitchen sink
We talk about love
We talk about dishwater tablets
And we dream about heaven

I know it
I think I know it from a heaven
They said so it doesn't need no explanation
Or a box to open up with light and sound
Making you cold, very cold

I leave home at seven
Under a heavy sky
I ride my bike up
I ride my bike down

November smoke
And your toes cold now

It goes from white to red
A little voice in my head said so

I know it
I think I know it from a heaven
They said so
It doesn't need no explanation
Or a box to open up with light and sound
And if you don't you'll run your own

Fever Ray,"An apple and a berry plant
Comes with a house
On the grass, who is that
To come by my house

Stands outside my window
Sucking on the berries
And eats us out of house and home
Keeping us awake, keeping us awake

Can I come over, I need to rest
Lay down for a while
Disconnect the night was so long
The day even longer
Lay down for a while recollect

Five a.m. out again
Triangle walks
Magpies, I throw sticks at them
They laugh behind my back

Getting a feeling
Maybe I will dream again
Having that feeling
When there's no one awake
No no one awake

Can I come over, I need to rest
Lay down for a while
Disconnect the night was so long
The day even longer
Lay down for a while recollect",Triangle Walks,2009

Fever Ray,"I learned this a while ago
Now it just takes a second
Didn't see it coming at all
It was over in seconds

Sometimes a low is a low
Still when pushing what's possible
A queer healing
Mom just had a feeling

You made me dirty again
She makes me feel dirty again
That old feeling of shame
She makes me feel dirty again

Dirty again
Why she wants me dirty again?
Dirty again
She's making me feel dirty again

Making me feel I want too much
Making me feel it's enough
Come over and see it
Come over and see yourself

Dirty
Why she wants me dirty?
Dirty again
She's making me dirty again",Falling,2017

We waited for so long
We waited far too long

Cool-tempered and ice age
We had so much to say
When you finally

We won't keep them back

When your story unfolds

Imagine using me

Is like waiting for a drug that never kicks in

Dismantled love
Touching in the snow one day
Laying low and kissing

This too will pass
Under the moon we last

Entre los dedos hasta hacerte mal

Dice que me equivoco igual que un topo
El corazón insiste si la ceniza es la enfermedad del cigarrillo
No estar contigo es el castigo peor

Are you in the big fish
Are you sitting in the belly of a world gone mad 
Have you turned your back in His wish 
On His will for your life, have you made Him sad 
Do you want to get out of the big fish 
Listen to God and follow His plan 
And you won't be part of the main dish 
He'll spit you out on to dry land 

You're one brick short of a load now brother 
You're one shot away from a bullseye 
You are missing the mark on your spiritual walk 
You started walking away now you're sinking
Into the deep, wake up from the sleep 
See your one fry short of a happy meal 
You are incomplete by your own deceit 
You turned your back, now you're going swimming

You're sinking low how low can you go 
So low that you don't know which way to go 
To the truth or to the dare? 
If you take the dare then 
You'll be swallowed there 
But run to the truth and you will find 
That a rescue arrives right in time 
To pick you up back on your feet 
Obedience is neat

And I don't know what to do
I don't know where to find my way back to the truth
I need a reminder
Of how life used to be
Cause the face in the mirror isn't looking too familiar


I can say that I used to know a lot about you
But it seems I've fallen from you
And I can say that I need to know more about you
So now I'm on my knees singing


(Chorus)


Breathe in me
I fall so easily
How can it be
That you would rescue me
So Breathe in me
Breathe in me


The time I have wasted
Is not just my own
I got to get back to You, I gotta find my way home
Before my world comes tumbling down
The longer I wait
It gets harder to turn around
To see your eyes staring right through my soul
Oh but I know
That life begins when I die again and surrender


(Repeat Chorus)


I can hear you calling to me
I can see you reaching for me
Offering your hand to guide me
Hold me close again and set me free

I can say that I need to know more about you.

Wanting to find release from the empty spaces
So I pack my bags and set out
Following traces of a better day


So I walk a thousand miles in the wrong direction
Building callous on my feet and a fine collection
Of wasted days and foolish ways
And baggage that I've picked up along the way


Then I hear a familiar voice calling me home
It's loves voice so I make the choice
To turn and follow


(Chorus)


And I fall to you
And you see through
All the foolish games I play
And I cast my cares away
And I fall to you
And I know you'll do
The same thing today
That you did every other day
When I went away


Trying to find the way with my own eye
It's like trying to find the sun in a midnight sky
The more I carry on alone
The harder it is to get by on my own


Then I see you standing there calling me home
So I throw down all my bags
And run straight to your arms

On the edge of the ledge

And I fall... I fall... I fall...

And so I'll be alright

With or without me
So I'll do my best and leave the rest

I think it's time for me to make a change
And start walking back to you
Before I go so far away
That I can't hardly see you
Reaching out, 
Calling the prodigal I said I'd never be
Now what I need is a little change


I've played the game before
But now the game is 
Taking more than I can give
And I'm dying to give in
But you're holding out for me
But what you're holding out for me
I can barely see
Because my visions' so dim
I try, but I can only hardly recognize
This light that should be blinding my eyes.

But I can't find nothin' on my own 
So I gotta leave myself be hind, take up this cross of mine 
Give away everything I hold on to

But Lord, I know I need you to help me do this 
Lord move in a way that I've never seen before 
'Cause there's a mountain in the way and a lock on the door 
I'm drifting away, waves are crashing on the shore 
So Lord move, or move me 

Out of this place of complacency 
To a place of fellowship with thee 
'Cause I am weak, but Lord, You are so strong 
And You know it's been way too long 
It's been way too long 

Lord move in a way that I've never seen before

I'm drifting away, waves are crashing on the shore

FFH,"Voices are everywhere, and they?re screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me. We?ve got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times. You can?t do it. You can?t do it on your own. You?re not smart enough. You?re not strong enough. You?re not stable enough. You?re not thin enough. And then there?s the enemy. The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you?ll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago. He?s a great man. I love him so much. And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him. My dad had just put a room onto his house. And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad?s work. And he got done and went to my dad, and said, ?That?s a good job Harry.? And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice. Without hearing that, whether it?s the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don?t have any identity. You have no way to function. I think Jesus knew that. I think that?s why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people. He never asked them to be anything that they weren?t. He tried to get them to understand who they were. That?s why he said, ?You?re my daughter, you?re my son, you?re my brother, you?re my sheep.? He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we?re His creation; that we're worth something.

Yeah, and that?s something amazing about Jesus. He could look down into somebody?s spirit and draw out who they really were. I mean, he looked at Simon and said, ?You know what? You?re not Simon, You?re Peter. You?re a Rock.?

And how ?bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, ?Daughter.? His first word: Daughter. 

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father. Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke. I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn?t inward. Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it. Like at His baptism, God the father said, ?you are my son, I love you and I?m pleased with you.? And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it. The father said, ?You are my son. I have chosen you, and God just established Christ?s purpose on that mountain.? And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour? No. This is why I?ve come. Glorify your name father. And the father spoke and said, ?I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.? And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross. 

I think it did too. You may have never heard that voice. That voice that says you?re worth it. You?re smart enough. I believe in you. I love you. There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it?s just a vacuum. Listen, Jesus doesn?t require anything of you. You can?t work to get His approval. Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, ?This is my son who I love.? Jesus hadn?t done a single miracle. All he asks of you is that you listen.

It's about you and me
We walked along the narrow road
You held my hand
We were a family 
It's was the only thing you'd ever known

And walk away
You bought the lie
You said goodbye

My hand is the only hand you need
Why do you keep on
Holding on to everything but me

Looking up to find a sign
It's been right here all this time
Oh, can't you see

It's about a love affair
We had before you walked away
Don't say you don't remember
Because I was there
Holding your hand, and we laughed
As we dreamt the days away

I wanted forever

Fher De Mana,"Si ella me faltara alguna vez nadie me podría acompañar
Nadie ocuparía ese lugar que descubro en cada amanecer
Si me faltara alguna vez

Si ella me dejara de querer cuando la contemplo al despertar
Siento la pureza que me da, nunca la pureza que me da
Nunca la podré corresponder si me dejara de querer

Si ella se olvidara de cantar ese hermoso mundo que me da
Cómo volvería a predicar si fue su palabra mi verdad
Si se olvidara de cantar

Si ella no inundara esta ciudad todo cambiaría de color
Gozaría de otra claridad
Cuando miro y pienso con dolor si no inundara esta ciudad

Si ella me faltara alguna vez
Si ella me dejara de querer
Si ella se olvidara de cantar
Si ella no inundara esta ciudad
Yo no escribiría esta canción

Spread out on the floor of her father's house 
Her promise was almost undone 
Under her tongue, dissolving her responsibilities 
To finally deny everyone with every unflattering comparison

And you don't care anymore 
And you hate all the people that you used to adore 
And you despise all the rumors and lies of the life you led before 
Did I hear you right? 
You're feeling hounded and pushed around 
You want to just lay down and die 
If all of this life has been such a big disappointment to you 
Why don't you stop blaming some guy 
And go give the next one a try 
All grown up 
And you don't care anymore 
And you hate all the people that you used to adore 
And you despise all the rumors and lies of the life you led before 
But look at yourself 
You'll see you're still so young 
You haven't earned the weariness 
That sounds so jaded on your tongue 
""I'm weak"" she says 
And blesses herself and gets into bed 
Clutching the covers to her throat 
""So punish me now and let me go back to the sham of my life"" 
""This night is the perfect antidote for all of the poison that 
You wrote""

That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck

And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

No time to lose, don't flog a dead horse
Let's go to Fiddler's Green

Burn the bridges, come along
Now I'm keen to
Burn the bridges, come along
Now I'm keen to
Help me now to sing this song
Burn the bridges, find my way to Fiddler's Green
Help me now to sing this song
Burn the bridges, find my way to Fiddler's Green

I stop to play it safe, rise from the grave
I pass the buck to lady luck I'm going on a journey and
Ring the curtain down, down down
Cause Fiddler's Green is a place I heard tell
Where the fishermen go if they don't go to hell
This rings a bell inside of me",Burn the Bridges,1997
Fiddler's Green,"Well, I saw her one fair evening it was early summer
Time
Man and nature were in blossom, I was really feeling
Fine
I asked if she would kiss me though I'm usually rather
Shy
But she Looked right into my face and said KMA goodbye

Long ago I had a girl friend she was pretty, she was
Cute
On a lonely winter evening I was in a crazy mood
I said: Won't you become my wife
And hoped that she would not deny
She just laughed her head off screaming KMA goodbye

I wonder if I?m born to lose
I wonder if I always get the sack

Don?t give in, don?t give up
Always bad luck
Why do I always fall on bad times!?
Don?t give in, don?t give up
Always bad luck
Why do I always fall on bad times?

Once I made a lovely journey but there was a traffic

jam
Next to me a pretty girl, sitting in a caravan
While I showed her all my love I overlooked that big
Tall guy
Who came over and he kicked me, he said KMA goodbye

Oh lord, mercy me
Show a little sympathy
Don?t let me die in agony
Don?t leave me high and dry
Oh ford, mercy me
Show a little sympathy
Take me to the promised land
How Long do I have to sing this song!?

Once I had a decent supper in a lovely restaurant
When I caught a certain glimpse, that I understood
Quite wrong

Left eye
In my right eye was her fist which means KMA goodbye

Fiddler's Green,"Narrator: 
As I came in by Achindoon just a wee bit from the town, 
To the Highlands I was bound to view the haughs of Cromdale 
I met a man in tartan trews, I spiered at him what was the news 
Says he: ""The Highland army rues that ever we came to Cromdale"" 

Highland Man: 
""We were in bed, sir, every man, when the English host upon us came 
A bloody battle then began upon the haughs of Cromdale 
The English horse they were so rude, 
they bathed their hoofs in Highland blood 
But every clan so boldly stood upon the haughs of Cromdale"" 

""But alas we could no longer stay for over the hills we came away 
And sore we do lament the day that ever we came to Cromdale"" 
Thus the great Montrose did say: "" Highland man, show me the way! 
For I will over the hills this day and I'll view the haughs of Cromdale"" 

Highland Man: 
""But alas my Lord you're not so strong, 
you scarcely have two thousand man 
There's twenty thousand on the plain 
stand rank and file on Cromdale"" 
Thus the great Montrose did say: ""Highland man, show me the way! 
For I will over the hills this day and I'll view the haughs of Cromdale"" 

Narrator: 
They were at dinner, every man when the great Montrose upon them came 
A second battle then began upon the haughs of Cromdale 
The Grant, Mackenzie and M'ky, soon as Montrose they did espy 
Oh then they fought most valiantly upon the haughs Of Cromdale 

The McDonalds they returned again, the Camerons did their their standard join, 
Macintosh played a bloody game upon the haughs Of Cromdale 
The MacGregors fought like lions bold, MacPhersons none could them control, 
MacLoughlins fought like loyal souls upon the haughs Of Cromdale 

Survivor: 
""Well, I don't care who's wrong or right 
cause men will die in any fight 
Can't stand the clashing of the swords upon the haughs of Cromdale 
Every night I see the dead, the corpses still inside my head 
Can't find no peace cause blood was shed 
There on the haughs of Cromdale""",Haughs of Cromdale,1997
Fiddler's Green,"Summer rain was falling and gave a promise of life 
We felt the water on our skin 
But then the light grew dim 
And in the flickering twilight 
We felt the shadow of fear 
'Cause we both knew that our days were counted 
No more time here 

She bid me take life easy, as the leaves that grow on every tree 
But I was young and foolish 
With her would not agree 
The wind blows right into my face 
And wraps the pain 
But there is something that tells me 
That nothing, nothing's in vain 

She's gone into the darkness 
Gone into the darkness 
Gone into the darkness 
Gone into the darkness 

And in my head thereâ??s a fire 
That's still burning for you 
An unforgotten desire 
That's sometimes breaking through 
And then the noise of the people cannot reach my ear 
'Cause there's a certain silence where we both meet 

She's gone",Into the Darkness,1997
Fiddler's Green,"Alone with you, there comes a time 
That makes the change 
A change deep down inside of me 
Once I was blind 
Now every sense crawls back to life 
And like a new-born I can see 

It takes no life to catch the bliss of happiness 
We long for moments that will last 
There comes a time 
When I'll be standing by your side 
A long day's journey into night 

Those seconds are the rags of time 
But they will make you see 
Those moments never pass you by 
I store them, I hold them in me 

Oh, I kiss you, miss you anyway 
Oh, I kiss you, miss you every day 

There comes a time 
When I will find that precious love 
Comes a time when time will end 
There comes a time 
When we will dance the night away 
A time when we will not pretend",Kiss U Miss U,1997

Fiddler's Green,"A holiday, a holiday, 
The first one of the year 
Lord Arnold's wife came into the church, 
The gospel for to hear 

And when the meeting it was done, 
She cast her eyes about 
And there she saw little Matty Groves 
Walking in the crowd 

""Come home with me, little Matty Groves 
Come home with me tonight 
Come home with me, little Matty Groves 
And sleep with me till light!"" 

""Oh I can't come home and I won't go home 
And sleep with you tonight 
By the rings on your fingers I can see 
That you are my master's wife."" 

And what if I am Lord Arnold's wife 
For he is not at home 
He is out in the far cornfields 
Bringing the yearlings home 

So little Matty Groves, he lay down 
And took a little sleep 
When he awoke Lord Arnold 
He was standing by his feet 

Saying, ""How do you like my feather bed 
And how do you like my sheets? 
How do you like my lady wife 
Who lies in your arms asleep?"" 

Oh well, I like your feather bed 
Better I like your sheets 
Best of all I like your lady gay 
Who lies in my arms asleep 

""Get up. get up"", Lord Arnold cried, 
Get up as quick as you can 
Let it never be said in fair England 
That I slew a naked man"" 

""Oh I won't get up, and I won't get up 
I can't get up for my life 
For you have two long beaten swords 
And I not a pocket knife"" 

""Well it's true I have two beaten swords 
And they cost me deep in the purse 
But you will have the better of them 
And I will have the worse"" 

So Matty struck the very first blow 
And he hurt Lord Arnold sore 
Lord Arnold struck the very next blow 
And Matty struck the floor 

And then he took his own dear wife 
And sat her down on his knee 
Saying, ""who do you like the best of us now 
Your Matty Groves or me?"" 

And then spoke up his own dear wife 
Never heard her speak so free 
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips 
Than you or your finery"" 

And then Lord Arnold he jumped up 
And loudly did he bawl 
He struck his wife right through the heart 
And he pinned her up to the wall 

""Oh, a grave, a grave"", Lord Arnold cried 
To put these lovers in 
Won't you bury my lady at the top 
For she was a noble kin.",Matty Groves,1997
Fiddler's Green,"Sometimes all your dreams go up in smoke 
All your hopes goes down the drain, it's all in vain 
Things go from bad to worse 
Sometimes there's a party but you're not invited 

Your ideals leave you out there in the cold 
They leave you high and dry and make your courage die 
And then you face yourself 
At least a part of you behind a dusty shelf 

Then you face the enemy 
Then you face the enemy inside

Take care! Don't let them put you in a trap

At least we know that we are on our way 
On and on, no more lies and no pretending 
We're gonna find a brighter day

But don't give up the fight

Fiddler's Green,"A rambling rover comes to town somewhere in the county Down 
He was only passing through, somehow feeling blue 
So many faces he had met and left without regret 
Still waiting for the chimes to ring and his soul to sing 

He found a pub where he could play, only for one night 
When suddenly he saw her eyes, desire at first sight 

Shot in the dark 
One step away from me 

And when he saw her pretty face, it was a castle in the clouds 
His aching heart was burning now and he felt no doubts 
He didn't dare to talk to her and so he fiddled for the crowd 
She stood first row in front of him his eyes were shining proudly 

He played a lovely fiddle tune and swept her off her feet 
And while he looked into her eyes his heart began to beat 
Collywobbles and the creeps, he went straight to the bar 
And when he had a lot of pints he sang Whiskey in the jar 

She drives him round the twist 
And now he can't resist 
Drunk as a fiddler's bitch 
And so he goes to make his stitch",Shot in the Dark,1997
Fiddler's Green,"Near Banbridge town in the County Down 
One morning last July, 
From a boreen green came a sweet Colleen 
And she smiled as she passed me by. 
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet 
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair. 
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself 
For so see I was really there. 

[Chorus]
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay 
And from Galway to Dublin town, 
No maid I've seen like the fair colleen 
That I met in the County Down. 

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head 
And I looked with a feeling rare. 
And I say, say's I, to a passer - by, 
""Who's the maid with the nut - brown hair""? 
He smiled at me and he say's, say's he, 
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown. 
Young Rosie McCann, from the banks of the ban 
She's the star of the County Down."" 

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there 
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes, 
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right 
For a smile from my nut brown rose. 
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke 
'Til my plough it is rust coloured brown. 
'Til a smiling bride, by my own fireside 
Sits the Star of the County Down",Star of the County Down,1997

If I don't go crazy, honey, I'm going to lose my mind

Your hair ain't curly, your doggone eyes ain't blue
If you don't want me what the world I- I want with you? 
Oh, your hair ain't curly and your doggone eyes ain't blue
I said now if you don't want me, babe, what the wide world I want with you?

Don't a man feel bad the Good Lord's sun go down?
He don't have nobody to throw his arms around 
Can't a man feel bad, I said when the Good Lord's sun go down?
I said he don't have a soul, not to throw his arms around

Looky here baby, what you want me to do?
I've done all I could just to get a-along with you 
Looky here honey, what do you want poor me to do?
I say I've done all I could, honey, just to get along with you

You know I love my baby like the cow love to chew her cud
I'm layin' round here though I ain't doin' no good
Ooh, I love you honey like the cow love to chew her cud
I'm layin' round here, baby, but I- I sure ain't doin' no good

You know the minutes seem like hours, the hours seem like days
Seem like my baby don't stop her lowdown ways
Oh, the minutes seem like hours, I said the hours, they seem like days
You know it seems like my bride never stop her old lowdown ways

I'm going to the gypsy now to have my fortune told
I believe somebody is stealing my jelly roll 
I'm going to the gypsy, I believe I'll have my fortune told
'cause I believe somebody is trying to steal my jelly roll

I got up this morning, feeling sick and bad
Thinking 'bout the good times that I once have had 
I said soon this morning, I was feeling so sick and bad
You know I was thinking 'bout the good times now that I- I once have had

The sun is going down behind that old western hill
Yes, yes
Ooh, behind that old western hill
And I wouldn't do nothing boys, not against my woman's will

You know I'm going away, I'll stay a great long time
I ain't coming back here until you change your mind
Oh, I'm going away, I believe I'll stay a great long time
I said I ain't coming back, honey, until you change your mind",Walking Blues,1992

And when you see me and my buddies up there, man

Well, I went down to my best girl's house 
The hour was just about nine 
I wasn't dressed up like Henry Ford 
But I was feeling just as fine 
I caught her sitting on another man's knee 
And I didn't like that sign 
Well, I told them what I thought about it, boys 
And I got mine 

I got mine, I got mine 
I grabbed my hat and through the window 
I went flying 
I ran as fast as I could run 
But I didn't get there in time 
Because the rascal grabbed a shotgun, Lord 
And I got mine",I Got Mine,1998
Fiddlin' John Carson,"I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie
When you and i were young long ago.
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill has decayed, Maggie
Since you and I were young.

They say we are aged and grey, Maggie
signs of life nearly gone
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
When you and I were young.

And now we are aged and grey, Maggie
The trials of life nearly done
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie
When you and I were young.

Fiddlin' John Carson,"A little maiden climbed an old man's knees—

Begged for a story: ""Do uncle, please! 

Why are you single, why live alone?

Have you no babies, have you no home?"" 

""I had a sweetheart, years, years ago, 

Where she is now, pet, you will soon know; 

List to the story, I'll tell it all: 

I believed her faithless after the ball.“

”Bright lights were flashing in the grand ballroom,

Softly the music playing sweet tunes. 

There came my sweetheart, my love, my own,

‘I wish some water; leave me alone.'

When I returned, dear, there stood a man 

Kissing my sweetheart as lovers can. 

Down fell the glass, pet, broken, that's all—

Just as my heart was after the ball.“

”Long years have passed, child, I have never wed, 

True to my lost love though she is dead. 

She tried to tell me, tried to explain—

I would not listen, pleadings were vain. 

One day a letter came from that man; 

He was her brother, the letter ran. 

That's why I'm lonely, no home at all—

I broke her heart, pet, after the ball.""

Chorus: 

After the ball is over, after the break of morn, 

After the dancers' leaving, after the stars are gone, 

Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all—

Source: Many the hopes that have vanished after the ball.
",After the Ball,1998
Fiddlin' Mutt Poston,"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine 
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else dear, could come between
But now you've left me and love another
You have shattered all my dreams

You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

Hay que agarrar

Del lamento del verso y el cuento. 

Porque llego el momento del amor 
De compartir de disfrutar 
Llego el momento de gozar 
De reír y de bailar.

Soy humano, tengo errores, pero nunca te engañe 

Que te costaba darme la cara, y decir que fue mentira todo lo que demostrabas
Que te costaba, me da coraje, porque yo me desvivía porque nadie te dañara
Que te costaba decir lo siento, no es de ti de quien yo vivo enamorada 
Más que nada no me pidas que le brinde mi amistad a la persona que me supo ver la cara 
La que sabía que mi amor no merecía, sin embargo lo aceptaba

Coi soldi in mente in mezzo ai guai
Torni tardi, non chiami mai

Ah, Baby non ti saprei dire com'è iniziata
Ma non poteva che finire fuori strada
Cantavamo quelle note stonate
Zero angelo custode, ali strappate
Perché tutto ciò che amo, mi fa male
Noi due amanti nel bagno di un locale
Cercando quella luce, come Icaro
Faccio male alla salute, così dicono
Ah, cose da matti
Ora non resta altro che raccogliere i piatti
Rotti, adesso guardi fuori e fumi
Dimmi cosa ci hai visto in questi occhi scuri
Questa testa è persa per questo grano
Quindi qua l'amore è un ago nel pagliaio
Appoggiata al petto dicevi strano
È freddo e nero, come la neve a milano
Baby, sono un guaio

Ragazza dove fuggi, zero porte

Ma tu sei una lucciola, io una fiamma
Alla fine ti brucerai, Bonny & Clyde
Quale scimmia sulla spalla, la mia è King Kong
Il soldo comanda, io e te una banda
Me and my bitch
Biggie nello stereo, sognando il Ritz
Dammi più chips, alza la posta
Questa vita è un quiz, senza risposta
Appoggiata al petto dicevi strano
È freddo e nero, come la neve a milano

Coi soldi in mente in mezzo ai guai
Torni tardi, non chiami mai

Ma poi come puoi fare sempre quello che vuoi
Coi soldi in mente in mezzo ai guai
Torni tardi, non chiami mai

È ancora come all'inizio
Il tempo non lo ridanno
Questo gioco è un vizio
Fumo per stare calmo
Duro come il marmo
Freddo come il ghiaccio

Quanti ancora ne faccio

8-ball of blow and a half a bag of weed

Anoche fue solo una aventura
Y yo no quería decirte adiós
Entre sábanas blancas tú y yo hicimos el amor
Y hoy, saber que ya no te tengo

Y pensar que ya tienes dueño
Pero yo contigo sueño más
Y qué hacer con esta locura
Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo

Y pensar que ya tienes dueño
Pero yo contigo sueño más
Y qué hacer con esta locura
Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo

Es duro de aceptarlo pero es así ya no estás
En las 24 horas yo no paro de pensar
De lo que pudo que pasar
Por que tuvo que terminar
Si todo era tan real

Ma' loco tú me tienes
Por qué tú no vienes
No sé por qué diablo te detienes
Si tú sabes que yo soy tu nene
El que a ti te enciende

Dame una noche pa' que veas
Pa' que me compares con él y tú misma creas
Que nadie como yo a ti te desea
Porque hago lo que sea, repito
Como yo nadie te desea
Y por ti hago lo que sea

Tu piel con mi piel, combinan tan bien
Que no hay margen de error
(Combinación perfecta tú y yo)
Hacer el amor, sin miedo a caer
Más es la tentación

Pero yo contigo sueño más

Sigo sufriendo, si no te tengo

Y pensar que ya tienes dueño

Escucha mamacita
Hoy bien le vengo a decir que yo
Me muero por repetir lo que vivimos esa noche amor
Pero por decirte tantas cosas
Bebita me muero por ser dueño de tu boca

Y tal vez que fluya nuestro amor
Después que los dijimos que sería un error
Un trago, una pasión casi no hay sentimiento
Pero quiero navegar hasta anclar en tu cuerpo

No me canso de imaginarme cuando volveré a tenerte
En verdad se me hace un deseo insaciable
Cuento las horas para no vivir de un recuerdo
No lo neguemos tú naciste pa' mí

No te niegues al amor
Dame una oportunidad
No quiero vivir de recuerdos

A lover, makin' me say ""Ungh"" like Master P
And helpin' me out when I'm deep in a catastrophe
She has to be, top notch and full of class
Or rollin' a new drop top full a gas, to pull her ass

Gotta come correct and you better have your game tight
She ain't the type of girl you meet and then fuck the same night
She's a hot girl, one that you can smoke Jane with
But so jazzy, flashin' her diamonds on her bracelet

She don't say shit, keepin' our love on the d low
I trust and believe in her, like Shiraz, she's my hero
She don't need no zero's she want a jazzy dime nigga to kick it with

Hydro twistas, gold grillers to roll with

And you don't have to be a dope dealer or an old nigga
So don't go twistin' with a gold nigga
'Cause she's a boss bitch, a slim Diana Ross bitch
That you can floss with that don't cost shit

And anytime I want to I can toss it
And when I toss it, I ain't gon' lie, I raw dog it
'Cause she's so jazzy, every five minutes I stop and tell her
Bitches playa hate because they not, they jealous

Long micros with lots of cheddar

And you were PeeWee
I don't blow shit out of proportion
I'll stuff you in yo mama's stomach
Rap her then make her have an abortion
The Vince Carter of rap, Shawn tall and brown skinned
Dunkin' dick in yo bitch with my arm in the rim
Keep yo hoe I chase dough
Burnin' rappers till sun-up
And jackin' off layin' on my back tryin' to come up
To get grip
Shawn slick with bricks for chips
I flip one-fifth of a brick
Nicks go for 6
Tug a four-fifth with more glits than 6 twists
I don't sniff but I spit
Catch a whiff nit-wit
Slick 6 style switch
Like a whip stick shift
I stole rap like the grinch stole Christmas
My clique pissed tryin' to hit licks to get grip
Tryin' to make more bread than Bisquick Biscuits
This misfit pissed cause I hit his chick
He mad cause I'm Indiana like Rik Smits
But he don't know I'm underground like the Ninja Turtle
He want to fight but he type that couldn't injure Urkel

Two clips in each ankle tucked low in my sock
Like lil' whodi Wayne ? I'll have yo block scorchin' hot
You need oven gloves to get yo mail out of yo box
To you rappers thinkin' you gonna come control my block
Check yo face you see a infrared now way it's not
Close to yo eye and in yo ears and all up in yo teeth too
So many red dots look like you sick with the measles
My clique hold heat too

You can call me the Kobe Bryant of this rap shit

Barely made it past the 10th grade

(B) That's what pain do to you 
(K) But I'm too broke to even die 
(B) I couldn't afford a funeral 
(K) I'm too broke to spend time 
(B) y'all don't know how it feel 
    I could've been a metal welder 
(K) 'Cause I know how to steel (steal) 
(B) Naw, I ain't braggin, I'm just keepin it real

(K) Man I been homeless 
(B) You ever spent the night in the grass? 
(K) With ants and mesquitos 
(B) While they bitin ya ass 
(K) My best friend got shot nine times for nothin 
    He was all I had, we used to lie and say we was cousins 
(B) Even momma turned her back on me, wouldn't look me in my face

(Boondox) 
As far as I remember, I been in high school ever since elementary 
Since the fifth I been twistin spliffs and hittin the weed 
My eyes went through menestration every day in the summer 
At age six, my piss could crank up a Hummer 
Had a hooker mom, like Alfred she Hitchcock 
Bumped dad, 'cause when he visit it was like a pit stop 
I lived knock hard, like Jay-Z, boy ya won 
Things got harder, at age eighteen, I bought a gun 
A three-eighty caliber, for street crazy scavengers 
Tryna take my ???, I'll turn your hat lavender 
Sacks of herb in my pocket I smoke eventually 
Supposed to be sellin 'em, but it's hard to give 'em away 
Livin the day for tomorrow, so on the down-low 
I used beats and rhymes, why not, look at me now 
From flippin dimes, playin get like me to get a dollar 
To ridin on my own twenties in my Impala, I ain't cryin 

(Chorus) 

(Kalage) 
Well, I been hearin a lotta people say that blood's thicker than water 
Well answer this then, which would you swallow? 
I said that to say, it don't matter, friend or kin 
Shawn ain't my cousin but he here through thick and thin 
(B) OK, I came up but all the faith folks came down 
(K) The script flip flopped 
(B) Now the game changed round 
    Everybody want to chill now, in my grill now 
    Now my smile ice cold, white gold like whooooooaaaa!

Look for field gores in tight clothes, hair weave an' micros

While you blazin' the gun an' too dirty, ain't no wastin' his bong

Suburbans on twenties player, swing at a grinnin' player

Wanna beef? Well, run your way, do it in 'bout four flat

Breakin' off ya folks too, belly full of soul food
Chitt'lins, greens, pork chops, green beens

Brown-skinned cinnamon, playin' and pimpin' men
Swimmin' in Benjamins
Body like a Buick bumpin', jumpin' and jigglin'
Butt look like big lips talkin' and whisperin'

Sayin' and her voice so feminine
Either her booty talkin' or my Hennessey kickin' in
I smile, give a grin, grab that butt with both hands
Man she moved it over and started hunchin' my Jimmy then

See, I'm gon' hit her then switch up and stick her friend
I'm skinny built like a spoon, they grits I'm diggin' in
I don't be spendin' ends but they gon' givin' chin
They lick it and kiss it then say

They pagin' and beepin', beggin' for me to come hit again
I'm pimpin' plenty women, game stronger than twenty men

Big breasts are proper set, her game, she on top of it
She break big ballers that'll infrared dot ya head

Micro's and contacts, ooh, I wanna knock her dead
Vicky Secret scents in the air, why I want her pop her leg
I heard in the streets that shawty give lots of head
Good hot my mouth too, have you jumpin' up out the bed

And plus shawty rock baguettes, chickens wanna chop her head
Off 'cause she jazzy with more cheese than broccoli
We on the dance floor, from side to side she rockin' it
Toot it up and stoppin' it then droppin' and poppin' it

She said ""Ooh, you on hard"" I had to stop and check
Pants pokin', I knew then her number I gotta get
Tipsy off of Heineken ready to shake some
Shawty flexa, time to have sexa

You can come home with me if you a girl on them six-inch heels
Or a black blonde with the natural and gold in yo grill

Earring in yo tongue, you dark and you lovely
Fine from yo heels up,but yo toes ugly
Plus it ain't bubbley, the back part
I ain't actin' hard, but you ain't touchin' me

Look, them tight Capri pants be fittin' her right
But her booty is much bigger, so that's what I like
I know a lot of shawty's out there sayin' that's not right
But she the jazziest and that's what I'ma take home tonight

A me say, I know a little girl by the name of Suzy
She look so sweet and she really sexy
I go home and she take off my shoe
Say ""Ohh Paparuby, let me make love to you""

On top my mind, me say ""My, my, my""
The woman on top of the woman is a lesbian
But the Ruby on top of woman it's a stylin' fashion
Stylin' fashion, it's a stylin' fashion

Field Mob,"[Intro: Cee-Lo]
It's 6 O'clock, it's volume 1
Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape

[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[T.I. and studio engineers interlude convo]

[Verse Four: T.I.]
Open my eyes, see the sunrise
Talkin about memories of G's got my tongue tied
Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

[Outro: Kalage]
All I know
Is I'd been down this road before
This ain't the first time, won't be the last

Mix it up whip it up a put in a pot

Cook it up let it sit till it rock chop

Babies in car seats I'm suppose to stay straped
Cause our country likes collard greens and grits
Which seem like Spike Lee they screem fa nics
But it keep calling me. Show me the ben ja mes
Scard I'll be on the team I'll be 12 like enemies
What's all the fuss about shut ya mouf cut it out
Ya ass a hustla make mo green than brustle spruots
Ya mad cause alcapon in a glida

At you wit ya red shirts look like a football playa
Wanna get rid of me cause I'm livin good in the

[Verse One: Kalage]
My shorty done cut me loose, and left me in the wind
Got a new man wit a Ph.D. and cheese, but he pees in the pants
He's 60, she's in her 20's, she said I be hard in her, overworking her
And when I hit from back it feels like I'm birthing her
She said I'm wrong for her, too long for her
But she never complained when I bought my ex home for her
But now she dropped me, like the pen at the end of a Sprint commercial
I try to hit it she be like no, like Laura Winslow to Urkel
And What if I did misuse and abuse your clique, I'll apoligize
'Cause I ain't know ruler sticks would bruise the clique
I saw it on tape tried to do the shit
Now, she say she want somebody simple
She say she want somebody gentle
She said, when I got head, I dug in her cheek now she got a dimple
I, I, I mean she cute with it though, I, I couldn't help it
The way she swallowed my pelvis
Had me seeing shit, had a nigga reaching for Elvis
And I come on her head, that some I'm a miss
That girl gave my dick more hickeys than a damn redneck locksmith

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
If she feeling like I'm feeling then she won't go
My shorty done cut me loose
She fucking other niggas and she fucking me too
She say she don't want no more
She say she don't want no more

[Verse Two: Boondox Blak]
I woke up this morning stretching,yawning with a hard on ??? ready to bone
Then I reached on my right and realized my woman's gone
I got to bring her to bed to hit her some more, but I found this envelope
Sitting on the pillow, I opened it, unfolded it, it said Dear Smoke
Hey, it's me Little Debbie Cake, and I feel it's best we separate
At least until I'm in better shape
cause I'm doing my best to shut up and take
The way you ramming inches in me
Slam me in different positions
Grasp and grip my hips and titties
Put one leg up drag and flip me
Fucking me up, down, back, to front
(How you squeezing and smacking my butt)
From right to left, left to right
(and peeing across my breast and thighs)
Fucking me early Monday, again on Tuesday
humpday Wednesday, then come Thursday
Twice on Friday and Saturday, and after church on Sunday
Hurting my stomach, beating the cock
But trip when I ask you to eat me twice, so we need to stop
Cause lately I been bleeding a lot, so I'm leaving you dox
To find someone that's fair and square
And not so hairy there, who fucks me there with care
Cause you put too much wear and tear on my derriere

[Chorus] - repeat 2X",Cut Loose,2002
Field Mob,"Yeah, all in my face feelin' me
All in my face feelin' me

We was up in the club
Fillin' these with all the intention we sip of Hennessey
My friend and me, I caught my niggas killin' me
Testin' weed until the enemy got the Tennessee

To hinder me, all in my face feelin' me
Bud we pretend to weed, Hennessey to silly games
Gangstas throwin' them signs up and up and down
Bumpin' enemies sayin' things that offendin' me

Still here and we ballin' half drunk, passin' out song after song
Inhalin' gun after gun, passin' out blunt after blunt, havin' fun
Them niggas took a jab at me, then one push from the back of me
Tryin' to tackle me and wrestle me

Couldn't get me down, so they hit me in the back and beat
They had me badly beaten
I gotta gash in me, but it was just a scratch to me
At first did get some Vaseline

A half a week, it cleared up fast and clean
To a scratch you were bad to see, so I ain't mad to see
I want to squash and flatten and beat
Like White Castle's and crystal square beef patties beat

'Cause I'm so sick of you harassin' me and playin' with me
So can we canopy?
Before we 'cause a tragedy and someone pain and agony
But if you feel you can handle me and still wanna take the man in me
This time I'll have to shut you down, like Sunshine Hennesin', because

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

Ow, ow, ouch, it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad

I'm from the home of racist rednecks and confederate flags
You could strand them hussies, politicians and drags
Cotton pickin', slave tradin' and nigga lynchin'
Lead to more oppression, me cricket caught trigger pinchin'

Ridin' along, mindin' my own business, God as my witness
It was five in the morn', passin' along, hop in the corner
No, police, hold up, turn the radio down
Put your seatbelt on, shit, God damn
Give me the fuckin' weed, he's gone

John, what? He kept goin'

It's like I got enemy's, 'cause of my race they hate me
Fuck pullin' over, chase me
Guess it's safe to say it makes me crazy
Can't give up, 'cause this hate it makes me

Wanna grab an AK spray strays on 8th street
8 ways and blaze the day bleed
E E 8 D D E 8 be
Tryin' to say we pull more keys than a leash of ladies

Well, okay, hate me, say we crazy but lately, baby
Even criticizin' the way we say things
I pray everyday, but the way he hating
I wish Jeff Dahmer was here, why?

So he could eat President Bush's baked beans
That's why I've been a crook since 18
Leave me alone, listen to what the hook is saying

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

I don't want no problems
And you don't want no problems, so
Better leave me alone and gone on
Nigga, better leave me alone and gone on

What's up son, it's Allecious, it's your boy, smoke
AKA Chevy Pentagram to cut your 'cain, again
And uh, I got a problem with you bitches
I'm sick and tired of bein' sick and tired

I can't even leave the muthafuckin' club
With a clean pair of muthafuckin' Schnegals
'Cause the muthafucka wanna step of my feets

I gotta check my muthafuckin'
Polo for birth spots and liquor stains
'Cause a muthafucker want oppression
But wanna get me on purpose

I'm sick of this shit
Don't be mad at me 'cause my earrings so big
And brighter than your beetch, nigga

And you beetch, don't be mad at me
'Cause my tires bigger than your niggas tires
On his Chevy, shit

Hatin' cause these hoes be..jockin! jockin!
Try me and my glock'll be..cockin! poppin!

Why you want to player hate on me?
Is it the big truck sittin' up on mike Jordans...that's 23's
With the big ole owl, dual heads roaring
Or is it the caprice sittin' Emmitt smiths...that's 22's

On the impala on 20 inches
Mo' wood in it than old abe lincoln's cabin
And with mo' glass in it, than in your cabinets
Or is it the way we come down watchin' xxx

White sex from the ceilin', visors, and headrests
Or is it the ?? chain, the Gucci hat, the gucci air Jordan retros to match
Even though I step on the scene, so fresh and so clean
Nice takin' with me, I still got my weapon wit' me

Strapped wit' a tech in my jeans
Ready to squeeze, cause I know you haters get tempted to wear my
Neck-a-lace.

Now just imagine if there wasn't no real niggas
No hustlers, thugstas, mobstas, and field niggas
On the real, t double d, I still keep it real
I love the streets that you fuck niggas named haterville

Lied on me, said I was a murderer, said I used to serve you work
But I ain't never heard of you
I love dub-deuces, only cause I'm sittin on em
And once again I'm gunnin, copped the big 500

A Chevy boy, candy green and chrome fronted
Niggas hide out or they ride out cause my shit runnin
I sold more oz's than cd's and lp's
Baby, I'm a thug plus I'm og

I roll 'em heavy, I'm bout my fetti
And the feds is what I'm headed
If you fuck niggas keep tellin'.

And ceelo twankys (choppin)
4 15' subwoofers (blasting)

Man, I want to shoot, slap, punch, kick, cut that niggaa!
That's what they say on the low
We're losing himmmm!
That's what paramedics'll say

While you lay on the floor
Can we all just get along? smoke trees, hit a bong
Haters pussy niggas, so I'm a choke 'em wit' a thong
Even the block envy me, I make a mill wit' the flo'

But I'm better wit' coke and hot hennessey
My peers is like queers they only get mad
'Cause I ride rims old enough to buy beers
They smileeee while hatin' but when it comes to fakes
I spot more than dalmations

Nobody deserve to be, hustled
Look here, run I dare ya
I catch ya, I'ma give ya more lashes than mascara
If its pride or die, I'm choosing respect
I saw my daddy hung dead, wit a noose on his neck
My niece got raped pregnant, won't tell she scared
Master done it, but she blaming it on drop dead Fred
But one day, things gon' change for better
Lord knows it can't rain forever
that's what I told my momma
Two days later master sold my momma (master sold my momma)

uh, uh, uh. I'm in the field, that's white lil' niggas and me
From dusk to dawn til the sun come and it leave
Through all seasons, Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring
Picking, pushing, pulling, cutting the field
Sweating bout to dehydrate, stuck in the heat
and when its cold, joints lock up barker than trees
Rest, I don't get enough of my sleep
cause master got us working late night, and then waking up in the wee
Hours of the morning, stacking stalks of hay
Hoping the rain from dawn til shower day
Wishing I could walk away
But then I think about Hardaway
Master cut off his hand
cause you can't talk or sing or speak from your mouth
If it ain't what master talk or say
But I was taught to pray to the Lord and have faith
Please take me away from this awful place
cause you can be so off today

Man I tell ya drop shit, ain't nothing
nuff suffering, done dealt with more headaches the buffering
Gotta spend my time off the destructive by getting by doe bubbling
can't risk stumbling, fumbling
So I'm bout taking my life, dice tumbling
I drop down the road, trying to get that pot of gold
Still out in the field, mobbing with Sean and Smoke
9 times, nine to five, I'm troop serving
Nine, you bout trying to eat well, get in line
'cause momma got laid off, the lil' sis need shoes
My brother just got popped back in his county blues
and Pops been made it off, there was no money, no food
Coming through next week, my rent and my girl due
Life ain't got no rules, destruction, one-two's
So every now and then, your gonna sing the blues

What's really goin' on? I want to know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad 
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

Late at night night and day, you was up under me

When I'm on the cut I can come to ya
And when I bust, you suck it up like a pundaba
You kept a bundle a under ya

Whatever ya got ya gave Smoke had
that's why its so sad...when ya say (ta take meee)
And I gotta disappoint cha
Its not I don't want cha

Expensive champagnes to drank trees to tree
And drop mo hits than Tina T receive from Ike
And mo classics than rees

Field Mob,"Stay up Hold ya head up
It's hell in the streets boy
Hold your head young nigga
'Cause it's hell

I'm sittin' in the courtroom, stomach full of butterflies
Somebody help me, cause my life is in the Judge eyes
They got me for a Humbug, and that's some bullshit
I should've listened to them preachers in the pulpit

Stressin' to heaven, seemed like I was born by mistake
While the races dominate, got me victim to the Legislate'
I'm playin' for kicks, hustle and rob reefer, it medicated my mind,
Fuck the World, with crime

My mamma died in '92 so crazy, what the fuck to do?
Daddy smokin' hard, not knowin' that it corrupted two chillin'
I'm starin' at the ceilin', can't take too many blows
The pain be killin', got the sinus up in my nose, oh

These people want to hurt me, my momma dead, so fuck 'em
A small timer on the rise, so nothin' I feel
To my niggas in the county, I might do a bit with ya
Boy, in the streets I don't care with ya, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

Now I was born broke, but I'll be damned if I'm a die that way
Love my momma, can't deny that face and as a child
Everynight I prayed for a rap record deal, man sometimes
Twice I'd say, ""Lord save me, take me away from here""

Twenty now, and I've been sellin' yay' for years
But why we had a house, and couldn't keep it?
Why we evicted? Why we get more pink slips than Victorias Secret?
Why I gotta rob? Why my pappa ain't gotta job? Why I ain't graduate?

Why through high school I ain't have a date?
Why I had to masturbate? Why I'm wearing hand me downs?
Why I'm in and out of jail? Why I let my family down?
Why my uncle died? Wish it would've been me

He ain't rob, he ain't hustle, should've been me
Preacher man, could you pray for me, faithfully?
When God comes lay him his herbs, tell him wait for me

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops
'Cause ain't no sunshine for boys or blocks, my nigga

'Cause it's hell
What we gotta go through, and only time will tell
When the pain is over, I'm down on my knees
Lord keep watchin' over, I'm lookin' for a better way
And I that's all I gotta say

He just keep layin' his hands on my momma again
Family ties, this is where the drama begins
Tellin' my momma on the floor, bitch this and bitch that
Locked in my prayin' to God, ""Please let me get back""

He's trippin' like he's outta control
So he had to of been smokin'I heard her croke
Through the wall, she was gaggin' and chokin'
Eleven years old, and I don't need to be seein' this shit

But in my tape deck, eight ball talkin' about beatin' a bitch
It got me confused, but damn, you shouldn't popp her that hard
And when them folks come , her stupid ass be droppin' the charge
Whippin' her ass like a man, right and left with his fists

Heavely blows to the dome, now she slicing her wrists
I'm hyped and I'm pissed, soaking wet with blood holdin' her limb
It's gonna be all right, she whispered with her bleedin' lip
She passed out, eyes rolled back, I'm tryin' not to panic

Step daddy walked in, saw my momma, then he went in a frantic
Blood leakin', non stop, permanent rush with the fever
She almost died, of loss of blood, I knew my momma wouldn't leave me
She don't deserve to live in pain, she just wanted to be happy

Feelin' like a puss, I didn't help her 'cause he ain't even my daddy
She's back at home, and he puttin' his hands on her again
Livin' in eternal fire, where drama doesn't end

It's hell
Nobody knows, the load, my soul tow
Nobody knows, the load, my soul tow

'Cause it's hell
Livin' off a thug, money things ain't swell
Don't believe me, go and ask my boys in jail
When we cryin' keep a knock for the cops

Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia

I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,

I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Its ya boy Chevy P babe...
Listen

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I remember as a kid back.. in the days
I got picked on kicked at... shit on spit at
Get gone get back (gone Smoke) get away
Havin a dark pigmentation was hard then to make friends
Felt like God didn't take his time with me
He musta made me late night tired and sleepy
Cause life wasn't easy they dogged me
Said that I was so dark the bet I could sweat coffee
And peepee sweet tea and spit oil
Say when ashy I lotion down in Armor All
Made me feel like a loser really lame
Because of my complexion nobody would include me in games
Not even tag never ""it"" nobody would touch me
Nope no girlfriends cause shawties thought I was ugly
Through all the jokes and laughs pokes and stabs blows and jabs
Hopin sad mopin mad before the scabs nobody told me that...

[Hook w/ 2Pac sample from ""Keep Ya Head Up""]
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
(this song is to all the dark skinned)
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry t-the blacker the berry
The blacker the blacker the blacker the blacker

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I ain't have Marvin Gaye to sing to me
And make me feel like black was the thing to be
Until Big Daddy Kane I was so glad he came
Made me feel good about bein black again cause
We was at the bottom of the market
(Al B.) made (Sure) it was a problem to be dark skinned
Until (Wesley Sniped) him
In with the darkies out with the light skinned
Now we got Tyrese Taye and Tyson
Mekhi Phife in every movie ya likin
Blade he remind me of a modern day Panther
While Batman (hides behind a mask) like a (Klansman)
We have to achieve... ('Caine's killin us)
Like it killed the second son of Adam and Eve
Ya palm is white and spread fist still black and tightly now
Slappin five was cool but rather ya ball ya fist and give me pound
'cause

[Hook]

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Tiger Woods say he ain't black... whatever
They say Michael Jackson ain't white... whatever
And Venus and Serena done beat mo white girls
Than O.J. and Rick James put together
Now Michael Vick's the new black hero
Bet John Madden ain't see it comin
(saw a quarterback as a negro)
Jordan he can't hide it he look like an African Tribal leader
If you can lighten him then you can brighten me up
Now don't get me wrong and think I'm prejudiced
Listenin to this song.. I'm not racist
As a matter of fact shout out to Jamie Lori and Chad
My white friends from Lee County to Bladecliff
Just bein dark is it what's like bein white in the audience
At a black comedy show I
Was guaranteed to get cracked on and joked out
Now this ugly duckling is a swan I know now

It's the F-be-I

And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds

Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,

You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia

Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome

Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

[Chorus: x2]

Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,

'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round

I'm addicted to choppin', I tried to stop, I-I-I feel the fiends
'Cause see I love Chevys the way they like a rock
I heard that Kanye West sayin' Jesus Walks
But if He see what I ride, He'll have a reason to drive

Stevie Wonder flow can't see me but you feelin' it
FBI forever Chevy tell 'em who they dealin' wit'

We the young do' slammers wear the crown around town
As the wheels on my donk go 'round and 'round
My speakers hit like Sammy Sosa, got that DJ Magic Mike
Backseat acne bumpin' like Craig Mack's face

Pissin' 'em off me 'cause he sloppy in his jalopy
Until I can sit my Chevrolet on 26s I'll be
Blowin' dro on 24s
That's how all my Field Boys roll

[Verse 1 - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Nowadays girls and boys wanna lick me
Her put her tongue on me him pull his gun onme
I won't let 'em get me I stay strapped
In case I try to stick her and he try to stick me
So I'm... packin my magnums
In case I gotta blast one
The only time I'm leakin out my head is when I'm sweatin
You ain't gon have me layin dead in my Chevy
I worked hard for my rings shades and bracelet
He left dead came to take it brains eraded
He bled red stains in pavement
His crane split slain he lay stiff.. think about it...
Before you make that move this be ya warning
He's ready to be squeezed like an orange
Bullets penetrate ya (bleedin like menustration)
I'ma empty out (more shells) than in (Run-D.M.C.'s) closet

[Hook - Chevy P aka Smoke]
I got my..
Pistol grip on the side of me
And ain't no bitch gon catch me slippin cause it ride wit me
I got my heater in my lap I'm squeezin on my strap
Try me you'll bleed
I let it rip empty the clip
Run up you'll die in these streets

[Verse 2 - Shawn Jay]
Shawn Jay known to rip a instrumental
You can bleed like I wrote pen but this one in a pencil
Starvin artist I paint a picture
Way I (touch O's) everyday for me like a game of (Twister)
Achievement say I'm a legend
Ghetto bitches be wishin they could spend a day in my presence
I'm stackin plenty dough I stay on cloud nine
Like 2Pac in ""I Ain't Mad At Cha"" video
Now start with me I'ma target ya click
The (Scope) I got ain't the type you (gargle and spit)
It sit on top of the fifth small semi's and 4-4s
Heat'll leave a enemy so cold
Thirty feet away with one eye squinted
You look like the man on the fuckin Public Enemy logo
First nigga start shit
Watch the tech spray a flame like a airbrush artist

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Shiit.. I'll die for mine you ain't gon take it wit ease
You better go (jack monterey) for his (cheese)
You run up on me in my 745 Beamer
You catch 7 shots from my 45... eat em
In my lap is where the heat's kept
I ride strapped and I ain't talkin about no seatbelts
When I pull shoot and blast I'm aimin at cha head
To make sure you dead you better wear a bullsetproof mask

[Shawn Jay]
It's no secret I keep the nina
It sit soul/sole food like sneaker cleaner
I sell those pies I tell no lies
Cookies same size as Tickle-Me-Elmo's eyes
You don't know no dirt
I'll put a hole through the head of the horse in ya polo shirt
Like a nerd in a science fair hang around projects
Bluck! when I stop by

Standards of living
They're rising daily
But home oh sweet home
It's only a saying
From bell push to faucet
In smart town apartment
The cottage is pretty
The main house a palace
Penthouse perfection
But what goes on
What to do there
Better pray there
Open plan living
Bungalow ranch style
All of its comforts
Seem so essential
I bought you mail order
My plain wrapper baby
Your skin is like vinyl
The perfect companion
You float my new pool
Deluxe and delightful
Inflatable doll
My role is to serve you
Disposable darling
Can't throw you away now
Immortal and life size
My breath is inside you
I'll dress you up daily
And keep you till death sighs

But you blew my mind

Or white as a egg minus all the yolk
On 20 inch spokes or flat out broke
We can do the thang loc cause why'all my folks

Break and shake shackles up off my feet
Po' out a little drank for the ones to see
Man I miss you Mausberg, homey rest in peace
I'm just down here goin through the day to day
Chasin pay, smash if you in my way
With 3 dimes and I'm lookin for a place to lay
Black Tone, where you at homey? (ANDELE!)
When we get a lil' drink we don't fight or fuss
But we do barbecue, slap bones and cuss
So let's get it get it hit it hit it ballin wild
If you want to get freak just ""call mi now!""

I'm role model (role model?) I roll models in and out of my room

Now hit the light switch, and turn 'em back on
And take off them clothes so I can see if youse the type (ooh man)
Be a sad day in L.A. if I ain't ballin (yup)
Be no dubs spinnin, dudes drankin, broads callin (nope)
Cause I've been runnin up tabs since I was 19
And tryin to spend the rest of my life with the right team (who that?)
Me and Crawf Dog (Crawf) we been off why'all (off)
Off of 2 dime pieces and playin softball
They swallow golf balls (golf) they swallowed Crawf Dog (Crawf)
They swallowed me and that's why I see we been off why'all (off)
At the sports bar, drinkin Chopan and Mucal and Adios Mother
Give me another, cause I'm loaded

There's Sam, with some bitch named Fay,
Where's my mom at, your mom got caught for killing your pops,
By the way kid, this is your aunt Fay,
And you wonder why I'm in trouble everyday,
Beaten on little kids, punking class,
Selling drugs, getting paid (getting paid)
So I dropped out of school, and met this 5 kids,
On my block, they were really cool (really cool),
Just as fucked up as me, and corrupt you see,
Everyone eat a dick, this is our gangsta click,
Just need a little love, not your money spent

Then I'll wipe my ass with your favorite tooth brush,
Erase all the numbers on your cellie phone,
On my way out, toilet paper your home,

Stomp out the flames, dookie on your feet,

Back out on the street, backpack full of treats,
Someone's gonna get burnt , stuff a frog full of fire crackers,
Put em on your door step,

You open the door it smells like chicken breast,
Drive by shooting, that's not for me,
But I'll drive by, and egg your car,
Now that's just funny, haha,

Pouring salt on snails, shooting birds out of trees,

Find it in yourself and start giving

This is good wood, I love that after-taste

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me
You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
Now it's time to love to be lazy, crazy as I sound you're amazing

Puff Puff Puff, give that shit to me,
So I can live, stress free like H.R. puffinstuff,
I love to puff and puff and puff, til I can see or breathe,
Sticky icky trees, you got my back, weed, mary jane,

Mouth watering trees, it sucks to choke, but when you done it's fun,
So I take another toke, slanted eyed as chang chong,
Four twenty, four twenty one, anytime it's fun,
But nothing gets done, weed makes me happy when I'm feeling crappy,

What's wrong with that? I ain't trying to feel like crap,
I ain't saying it's for everyone, unless you like fun,
Don't be afraid, to act dumb, don't even trip, but if you do it's fun

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me
You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
Now it's time to love to be lazy, crazy as I sound you're amazing

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me

1st Verse: [Master P -- Fiend] 

Master P: 

Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, 

but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin' 

captain? 

All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, 

I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. 

I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, 

No Limit niggas don't say hoes, 

ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... 

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change, 

but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains. 

Chorus: 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby.

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze), 

all you ghetto hoes get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig, 

bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in 

approximately five minutes. 

Chorus 

Verse Three: [Mystikal] 

Aww HOLD UP!!!, WAIT A MINUTE!!!

and where the fuck I went? 

Bitch you be beside yoself, you probably WOULD,

Get the fuck out my face, ya' fear too, stop runnin' 

behind my G dues, can't wait to see that nigga that got 

trampled like that 'cause that ass whoopin' been due. 

It's thinkin' like that, that make it hard, 

for me and the rest of my niggas. 

Mean these tramps they it like weed, 

SHE GETTIN' THE BEST'A YOU NIGGA!!! 

Lettin' dem' hoes sit on they ass, and come up off yo' hard work,

We capitolize and monopolize on everything we see 
Keep pistols drawed and cocked

The tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes 
Want some mo? 
Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic 
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets 
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto 
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her 
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed 
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away 
So stay in yo place, when ya hear mamma speakin 
Cannons spray, clear the way, when ya see the tank creepin 
Chorus (2X)

Hi i'm that nigga that rappers look up to 
If they want to know how to do it 
It could be the little bitty skinny muthafucka 
With the braids in his hair 
Used to live on Tchopitoulus 
I done paid my dues, but still playin the blues 
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose 
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news 
I wasn't a No Limit nigga, but I made the move 
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop 
You can't stop me, so, bitch, don't try 
We TRU soldiers, and we don't die 
We keep rollin, n-n-nah-nah-nah 
All aboard, it's like a band inside 
The group going hallelujah 
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside rumors 
Little bitch sayin he there, we there, be where? 
see there, Silkk there, Fiend there, Mamma there, P there 
Ain't no salary cap, on top of my dollars

Fiend,"Chorus:
Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more
I'm just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas want to blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
don't want to see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started?
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really ain't hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool don't mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors
see I don't had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards
non-packers
I'm strapped like P
or see
they ask for me 
capture me 
but I'm going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
y'all young crazed punks are trippin 
don't hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ??
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ??
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for?  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I can't fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know y'all gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get something 
don't worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say that's not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they won't touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just can't call it or catch
but i still got G's and I'm still ballin

Won't you lay up there and give me the chance
I ain't saying romance, now what you to be enhanced
I'm matured enough, and I ain't approached you for nothing
And the reason I came up off cause you working with something
Now I done had a little herb, now I done build up the nerve
On top of that my head tight from everything the boss serve
I'm pitching, cause your curves got me wanting to slide home
And prove that I flip other things besides ounz
Tel your girl you're gone, baby you gots to rome
He leaving with things, he get it on, get it on
You cold make me moan, so you up for screwing me
Please use engenuity when you doing me
Damn you ? blues with you matching hot shoes
Pretty legs but knees gone get bruised
There's no one gonna get used

Straight to the point shorty
Look I'm trying to do something

You wanted me to see you and I'm thinking about creepin'
Far from home, destination unknown, rock bone
Hotel booked and I don't wanta be alone
Maybe it's the tone got me visualizing this song
Camouflage love all night making me moan
Thug passion, in the back seat ripping off your fashion
Run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin
I'm here tonight and the vibe is right
Red and blue lights are glowing over Brian McKnight
But tomorrow my flight, and I'll be outta your sight
Take my address down so you can write
But for now lets do something
Fuck the frontin' and the talking
My dogs just about barkin'
Take your outfit off and put the soldiers shit on
And go to the war with me

Hit me when you trying to do something

But I got some hands of steel
(slap slap didn't I tell ya bout playin huh)
But baby in these streets it's kill or be killed
Murderous skills
Ready to do what I gotta
Keys for 1-3 so I got a lot on the collar(come hollar at the collar)
Herion and powder
This shit go keep me in power
I want money as my mattress and take moet showers
Drug deals go sour
That's why my gat on the side
So want ya come test the mother fuckin' baddest alive

Chorus x2
I ain't to be fucking with I'm a Jones nigga
Born to get it on for the throne
The dirt I did got me named Capone
Blowin' homes
In revenge, for my partners and kins
Murdered many men 
Some personal but mostly for ends
My sins
Be forgotten, survivors actin rotten
With the cocaine crockin'
I got the Champagne poppin'
Plottin up stragetted warfares
For my heirs, Nigga
I don't care
For that ? got me scared
Somewhere niggas made it home
With there loss souls
Heads I done toss those
Left in the crossroads(handle that)
The yard full with mother fuckers who died in the game
But a car full of niggas died crying my name
Releasing pain like Charde
But in my way(my way)
Split a blunt on the highway(highway)
Cause it was my say(my say)
I died that day but GOD told me finish my task
Hit the hash, grab all the guns and cash
And dash

Fiend,"Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out

Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm  tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed 
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs

If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before

Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being

Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor

From tha ghetto I get much love
Ain't no motherfuckin' crosses
Wit' all these crime bosses

Nigga, Nigga, make a move
I'll have you sleepin' wit' dead dudes
My tattoos, represent my identity
It reveals that hard-will of a hard-kill nigga that's n me

My enemies on a rampage, tryin' avoid my presence
Fearin' immediate death, like a fateful pheasant
N my kingdom, only strong soldiers live, that's that law 
Of that ghetto, I broke my hand on a fool's jaw

I'm southpaw
Hand to Hand combat, it's very necessary
My first option, is fightin' all my adversaries
That nigga flinched, when my motherfuckin' gun went ""POW""
You heartless motherfucker, don't cry now

[Chorus: x6]

Nah  Do you know my old lady (Quarter key  Quarter key)

The one that made all y'all buster niggas shady 
She made everyday in the hood in the hood just gravy 
Kept me thinkin' that gang a nigga named Jackers was gonna play me 
See my baby, would amaze me, when she hit the block 
Her dycker names are grams, pizza, and rye 
What she got ain't no need for another bitch 
But its so hard, I don't seen brothers kill brothers quick 
Mothers done lie sick, from ,meeting up with my girl 
She done make my pockets fat from Corruptin' world 
But see don't let hr high tonight 
Cause she'll make you end your life tonight 

[Chorus] 

I have a lot of bitches 
I made a lot of riches 
I fucked a lot of bitches 
Which is the reason 
I fell in love with her 
I never meant to hit her 
She's the preachers daughter 
And Quarter Key is what they call her 
She's a Chi town baller, checking cheese from new orleans 
Then she ship it down to her folks uptown in Harlem 
When my chips get low, that's what my old lady for 
Can you hear me dog nigga, do you feel me dog
All my niggaz in the game feel the same way 
Getting honey for the money, then cut like O.J. 
My lifestyle is crazy I'm living way to shady 
I'm at the pad acting bad my old lady 

[Chorus] 

She drive me crazy can't keep her off the streets 
A down bitch, down to make me rich, she hot, she makes me keep some heat 
Some say I switch cause I left my boy for that girl 
But they tripping, she's true 2 me, they tryin' blues so let that bitch run 
My world she understanding never demanding 
And never overweight, when I go to jail she post bail 
And when I'm hungry she fixes a plate she's playa hated 
By these sucker, and homie they wanted the beef 
She kept my homies paid I know they like her 
Because they nicknamed her ""D"" 
 
My old lady snow jumped off the poacher 
Native four expensive hoe she balls cutthroat 
With gangstas cross if you here to one time 
Ain't no flossing, but if you pimp the bitch and stack the grits 
She make em good money they hoe hype stand on the block all day 
Long police mad, can't stand my bitch game plan 
Slick with her should I love money making bitch 
She got that fire, got all that junk and boy 6 

My old lady be the thug hoe 
You niggas want to love, my old lady tattoo slug bouncin' 
That ass in the club my old lady got the tweakers ,tweakers 
And she love when I beat her with that b-12, and watch it swell 
Making my paper on the streets, ugh and since I 
Pimp her so sweeter it comes back to me 
A boss bitch, every nigga want to please 
But they better get the fuck from around me, soul survivors, up in it 
Pimp that hoe for me from that LAP, to the LBC now pimp that hoe for me

Son, didn't I tell you I don't want you fighting?
But he called me a nigger

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Its a shame when you can't send your kids, to decent schools
We live in the world for the laws and no rules
Gang-bangers, crease sides, and chalk lines
Correctional facilities full of juveniles doin' petty crimes
In this ghetto, got me crazy
Sometimes I wish, mama wouldn'ta made me
But its a shame when you gotta raise a baby
And the color of my skin might taint me

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

And all the money can't change the color of your skin
Why so many blacks and Mexicans in the pen?
It is cause we VIOLENT?
But why Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and started smilin'?
So many people have dreams
But why society eliminated Martin Luther King?
And they tell us to be proud to be black
And at the same time Uncle John shoot us in the back
Independence, its a free country
No jobs, most blacks turn to street money
A bunch of ghetto full of drugs and alcohol
Where found history books about white laws
And Tommy Hilfiger discriminate
And sell us clothes
But we can't blame him cause
We don't support the black stores
And only God can judge or point the finger and what's
White or black and red and blue equals gang banging

And I know they didn't do it
But still they can't get back
I see the copper be tryin' to nail me
Police constantly trailin' me
Cause I'm young, rich, and black
I'm always under survelience
Dash me out the car
And wanna ask me who the car fuck
Thay allowed to carry guns
Can't never be convicted
Who that law fuck?
I'm guilty till proven innocent
Still we all equals, how do you figure?
Cop told me
""you weren't speeding but I'm gonna give you a ticket cause you a nigger""
I seen the hardest of my homies
Break down in tears
A white judge looked them in the eyes
And gave them 35 years
Now its a everyday struggle
I hustle just to live
To raise your kids
When they got them teachin' them
Their parents better than them
They got me thinkin'
The color of my skin
Is a sin
I'm a black man in a white man's world
Where its set up for me not to win
Lookit, ain't that about a bitch
They look at us like we ain't shit
But lookit, I ain't racist, but face it, it exists

Whether we wanna be judges, doctors, or lawyers
Ain't a black or white thing
Pick the best man for the job
And there shouldn't be no hatin'
Where you live, if you can afford to buy a house
Should be able to live wherever you want
The same hospitality they give to athletes
And movie stars
Should give that same hospitality and companionship

Fiend,"Every soldier got a story to tell

I done been through it all
Don't ask the way I shoot 'cause I done shot (uggh)
Put a tank on my block
Fiend gone get the scene hot

Greens and rocks
Burnin' flesh
Have you ever smelled nigga?
Been tapped up, ready to die from mail niggas

Straight goin' to hell
But livin' the dirty, dirty
Havin' yah mama worry
That (?)

Tired of being blast at, but didn't cast that
I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked, (?)
Blast back

Told 'em to cast that, take these rounds and add that
But fact is you don't fuckin' choose yo' wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns

[Chorus: x3]

Check my war wounds (uggggh)
My war wounds (ugggh)
Every soldier got a story to tell

My adversary's get popped
Got me runnin' from cops
The ghetto life be a dime
Got me carryin' two glocks

My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drive-bys and rags
And representin' red and blue flags

See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos

Pullin' in car do's
And cut up Jabos

[Chorus: x2]

I'm down the blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die
If the hood call me

That's why I be hustin' every day
Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

See I'm a risky rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga

See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been scared, popped at, and shot at

But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I ain't forgot that

[Chorus: x2]

It's real, shit's real check my war wounds
This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons
I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube
Either me or you right here

Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Lay yo' ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
There's no overcome to this shit
Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq
If you don't believe me check my combat pack

[Chorus: x3]

I got a motherfuckin' story to tell
Nigga, nigga what?
A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?)
Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell

And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
I shank niggas, bank niggas
Do mo' for show
Seven cluckas, fake dough

Stayin' way cut throat
I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin' in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall

Seven Eight ward
Eastside, rollin' dubs
Call me big Snoop Dogg
Follow me, and you'll see how Gs move

It's written on my face
I takes my war wounds
Been around drama since me and my mama
Use to listen to oldies

That's why I'm so old G
Look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside
When y'all was learnin' how the sing
I was learnin' how the bang and ride

For sure bro, I told you
I'm a gangsta soul ja, blowin' doja

Put it down like some shit when it hit the toilet 
Put it down like some coke when I'm bout to boil it 
Put it down like babies falling out the bed

Put it down like Pippen on a fast break 
Put it down like freaks hitting the ground

Put down my # on paper because I want to put a down on 
I done clown zones, I'm a bust rounds on see I'm a Jones 
And I put it down like Cedric fame by Louisiana up in the dome 
See I'm blown but usually I'm foolie when I'm bad with the toolie

It's f-I-e, o.g. ready to prove that I'm strong enough
Prepared to rip a nigga down if he look at me long enough
I'm supposed to be fucked up with my mental capacity
That's why these killers and they old ladies be coming after me
They won't be no more after me including my body faculity
Look at my name, I'm to blame for all these casualties
No one as bad as me, I search the galaxy
And I'm willing to put up my no limit royal salary
Go ahead make my manner please if the yapping don't decease
When I stomp, you ? ? ? , get up and catch a breeze
I ain't lying I'm horrifying, I'm the bull up in the pit
Full of that shit, and ain't resting till you get your ass whipped
Know what I'm sayin

Still keeping it real, smoking weed, drinking hennessey
Every nigga around me that's why none of you niggas can bother me
I'm gettin fucked up so how many wanna ride with me
If you got a blunt get it lighted, come get high with me
I like to smoke till my lungs can't take no more
Got me ducking and diving like I'm strung out on coke
But still one of the most dangerous niggas you ever came across
Better cock my shit and bust until they label you lost
With no remorse, me, fiend, big ed goin be all right

Talkin bout where my niggas at and where the bitches at
Where the fuck my niggas at, let's get this party started

Now when I said fuck y'all niggas, best believe that I meant it
For every bullet that hit your dome best believe my gat sent it
Niggas talk shit and repent it, cause they know my hollows did shit
I'm back on the streets as a hitman cause my stash is gone I spent it
Gotta jack you for your paper, I'm a no limit terminator
Hit you like a gladiator, shake you like an alligator
What's up now bitch, when I hit your town get shot or duck down
? ? ? ? ? get buck down, two sheds get high no time for showdown
Slow down, I got my gat all in your face
Don't make me sound this bitch off like I'm about to start a race
And leave your head all over the place now that ain't no fun

Welcome to a soldier world

They know if you get in the way of my paper chasin
Knowin it ain't no escape from a hungry baby in ya face
So I love the place
Gun sparks through New Orleans dark
So death my gat shoot ya

Have to put a fool on the floor
And I won't ignore
Cause Fiend is my name

So I have to have some born sense
To be a provider

Fuck the pride

Funny how you got a 1000 grams
How the dope heads just wanta be me
want to kill me
A young g
With a half a nerve
About to act a fucking donkey just for half a bird
That's my word
Smoking backwoods filled with erb
Hanging later than street lights posted up on the curb
The ultimate serve
Getting it off all in a week
Time to re up
So I'm go be up
Getting the grind in the streets
Nigga!

(Chorus 2X)
I keep my strap on me at all times(and I ain't lying)(I ain't lying)
I keep my strap on me at all times(and I ain't dying)(I ain't dying)

Nigga who lied and told ya these streets was safe
We about to burn the chase
In all the place 
Go be leavin discrace
Watch what happen to who dare to step in my face
Strong arming for space
Which shop
I'm go leave them baggin grams
I'm a bad man
Strap in my hand
Give me some mad plans
Picture my city
Surrounded by crimnals
And then some
I'm go have to hit one
And back them bitches off with my m-one
Them domes!!!! domes!!!!!!
That's what he caught
Have to lay him in chalk
Should seen Serv
Insurance should of been bought
What the FUCK you thought
That Fiend 
State ya rank
The silent private
That be pistol whippin niggas down to the ground
Till there bodies turn blue and violet
My greed is violent!!
Born with plans to be ?
When the folks come I'm go leave it
Got him in the headlock
Some niggas ?
911 go need it
My nine my only justice
Rollin past screamin fuckers
My nine stang a nigga quick like some nunchucks

Brang ya boys and ya another gat
You'll be suckin up stains
Beware of my nigga

About to act bad, and I ain't been home for a week
I want to see ends, I also want to see ends meet
The last high that I had was the jailhouse heat
Gotta go 223, that's the waiting in the shade
a lot of people about to end up dead, runnin around with their lead
Being followed by the nigga hating feds
I had to ask them, what's that in your hand, all I said
Picture Fiend with this, they made me do it my friend
And I make em see it end, 'fore you bout to take me in
See shit spin, I'm tryin to get the crack in the day
Word on the streets, you really got it happenin your way
Now I'm rapping away, but not to keep me out the penn
But since I'm out, I'm out to test the hearts of men
See this wimpy grin, it mean, one seven he die
With cabbage aside, you bitches still gonna be the baddest alive

ain't too many niggas really got on the billing
To better pockets, ready for some violent killing
Now ready puff in the cutlass, at the down south buck it
Taking other peoples shit, loving every minute of it
You know what it takes to go against odds
Watching my back, with some niggas like Keke and Boz
Jump in my 81 ride, lookin for prey in the meal
Gimme everything, I'll see if this tank is for real
I dish this raw deals to keep this ghetto peal
I think I truly love ?????????
For somebody getting through me

Alone at street stories and ties

So I put it in my rhyme
Thirty two hundred square foot, no doubt
Manicured landscape, and this my house
Paid out too, so I know I got the room

Taught up from the world, that you gots to be hard
Shit, New Orleans is the city, I remember fightin over wars
See, long before you give me the charge I beat my cause
I'm a nigga no more or less surrounded by flaws
I'm all yours but understand my future thoughts a few
My days could be navy blue, and I'm a believe in you
See I'm TRU, because my niggas keep me goin as well
Droppin tears cause I'm the only one alive to tell
And if I'm goin to hell, at least my life is enriched
By keepin family beside me, and they accepted me as click

And no matter how many bullets, bring her back no time soon
I'm tired of departing with killing, all of my dogs bleedin
Bodies every other day, on Washington and ?????
Oh lord, I'm even scary to open obituaries
Gettin mail from cemeteries stating that I'm buried
Pain varies, to tell the truth it all hurts the same
If I don't to see some rain, cause life is a strange pain
Bullets don't carry names, but me, it's like short
Now here on life support, from not the right support
I hold your quote like the killer, but lose a G
A small fee for what that nigga did to a family

Chorus x2

Shit, I'm a reminisce like this while I'm in a good state of mind
Now I'll never low, truly knows in no greater time
Down line, I've a lost some of my best partners
Bullets pop us got em cause the rhyme, was it the coppers
Now who is to blame, the hunted or the hunter
Cope on his mind, much as I can and wonder
Was my prayers to god injected or neglected
Question the man if I can or respect it
Serious, if just by my minutes, if us gone as beginners
Split em, we piss on the ground, screamin bury me with em
My lord, you never suffer newborn, I'll guard your daughter
Killing in my city like there's something in the water
Why bother?  Because Fiend's strandin heads then I'm gone
And a soldier gonna survive till it's time to go home
Now notice I'm a survivor
My feelings go out to the families of G Slim, and Miss Michelle Tyler

You know you done fucked up?
You know you done fucked up, don't ya?
Nigga you really fucked up.
We on a muthafuckin mission.
I'm ridin dirty with my tru muthafuckas.
Fiend, steady mobbin', see-murder in this bitch.
Retaliation is a must.
Dumpin rounds on my muthafuckin adversaries.

Nigga, nigga ridin dirty for revenge
With my friends, I'm on a caper
Ready to kill 'em, if I see 'em
Fuck alarm, hold my paper
I'm a rider, so I leave 'em where I left 'em
When I creep, niggas sleep
And they ain't restin til they deep up in the concrete
Jungle with them slangers, with them bangers and them hustlers
With them killers, smokin woo and makin deals with my tru niggas
Fiend had some yay, so we flipped it on the block
Steady mobbin' flew from cali so we put 'em up on the spot
Servin dub sacks and flippers, fifty shots and quarter bags
Raisin riches no matter week, servin keys out paper bags
And hustlin hard, countin money by the sack
Watch my back, niggas jack
Sweet revenge, counter attack up in my 'lac
Sippin hennesy and chronic, I'm the tweak for some magic
Rollin the window, nigga, it's him so pistol playin bout to have it
Fuckin bullets gots no name nigga you name is on this one
Ridin dirty with my tru bitches so nigga on a mission

Fiend, my reason to gunplay
Loadin my chopper right up the one way
Wishin we facin a dead end
So I could show how this gun spray
Just one damn word, that's all I desire
So I could bend these niggas back like chicken wire
Spittin fire, mobbin, s'on when them bullets get to pourin

I ain't ignorin, no problems, no worries baby
I severed the crusher, and buried my (..? ..)
Over the dresser, fiend the trigga my lesser
Gon test ya, with a season to kill
And catch me celebratin across the battlefield
Loco, this is the deal, let's put the gun
To the small of his neck, we got caught up and blast
Until there's nothing left, boy
I thought some more niggas kept, what? what?
Cause I ain't facin prison
Exercising my right to exorcism
Completed my mission, huh?
By lettin the land just listen
Cause they the reason my lil homie ain't livin
So, we on a mission

Being crooked, we do it dirty, (we doing it!)
See-murder and fiend (there they go!)
We dump the fifty round magazine
Locin and mobbin, til it's clean (make sure it's clean)
Hooked up with the colonel, and the billy, cause I need cream
Fifteen five, made twenty five, six hummer size (nigga!)
Muthafuckas died, (nigga!) all in one night (they die!)

[steady mobbin' 2] (a lot of these lines are overlapped by screams,
Gunshots, etc. hard to understand...)
Pulled the trigga on my nigga (not my nigga, damn!)
As the forty caliber shell, blew up in the neck
Twice in the head, he was dead 'fore his body hit the ground
(damn dog, don't go nigga!)
Bitches scream, nigga (..? ..)
Pull up next to the bodies, I was runnin
My dog's head was blew off
I'm bustin hella (? ) (buck, buck, buck)

I only fuck with a few
You never know what these niggas'll do
You better choose careful who you call your crew
And do a review on these bitches, before you call em your boo x2

You never know what's goin on with
Some of these hungry ass niggas arrested
And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Receiving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion.

Chorus x2

I'd rather die hustling then be broke and lonely
Cause most of these niggas out here be phony
Find me on the street corner living my life fast

Keep your eyes on your enemies cause they'll blast you

And momma sheds tears cause my homies seen that
Nigga gangbang seen tru up on my chest
To my niggas in jail, stay strong doin time
I thank the lord for taking me out the ghetto with these rhymes
Blood stains on the street cause this ghetto life's a bitch
And that's a shame cause it's bound to change once a niggas rich

Chorus x2

[silkk the shocker]
Come take a ride at, before the game begins
I seen niggas die bad, and they die for pennies
Can't trust nobody seen around my way
Niggas dead, and that's why they ain't around today
See penetentaries, they ain't no place for me
I tell my mom don't trip, just pray for me
And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years don't even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life
That's why I ball till I fall and live the first right
So even though I thug with them, I still ask these niggas
I've seen a lot of cold shit, ? ? ? ? ? been home test if I get ya
I only ride with niggas that I test the water with
Niggas I slang quarters with, slaughter shit, spent the hardest shit
Only trust a few, only trust a few

Cause it blast thicker, hose and get off in that ass quicker

From the wrong way, I'm killin these niggas the jones way
Let the psalm say, he died as a hata
Sooner than later, shoulda pop em since the incubator
My life is droppin heron, at the sharon
Lookin, death dead on
Knowin I was dead wrong
From the sad songs, have you been to my city?
If you ain't got shitty, everything is far from pretty
But I'm one bad fucker that's always claimin tank
Niggas know n.o., dank, and elevate

Welcome to New Orleans 
Where police are corrupt
And niggas with no money die at the ages between 15 and 21
But see me? I made up my mind a long time ago that I'd never fall into that
system
I'm a hustle till I get enough, then I'm a get out
But you know what?  I got caught up. Started fiending for that shit.
So now anything you sell, any corner you work for, remember that's my shit
I could take it from you any time I want to
As long as you know that, I won't have to make an example outta you. 
Remember, That's the words of Fiend

[chorus]
I say the streets ain't safe I know I could be a goner
Tryin' to make a million dealin' around the corner
And nigga Fiend know one day he's gonna have to die
But What? nigga What?
And with my gat on my side, I'm still gonna be the baddest alive(alive)

I'm an automatic pistol bustin' He laughs, screamin' down to the haters
Caution his lies knowin' he gonna pay for it later
But Fiend...?...of bieng the baddest
Later On, Never to go, just mama command us
Nigga no heat advantage, stay hustlin' livin for the day
Robbin' to the way in the allyway, that soldier ain't prayin'
Forgive me, I almost waited for my breed to help me
They won't doubt me so I'm a take somethin to get wealthy
Healthy, young, got a gun ain't afraid to lose it
This corner, I'm about to lose it. It's life I ain't choosin'
I was placed here, a nigga before me was erased here
Killa face fear but I plans to make and count cake here
Get down and show me you're Bout It Come and take what I took
That chef was paddin' the way you got the face of a crook
Project walls shook, until Fiend's Spirit rose in me
I chose to ""G"", Wait until the world get a load of me

[chorus]

Lord they know i don't fuck around
Livin' every day like my last
It's a damn shame the dirt I done did for the cash
Is it my fault? Makin' sure my hood gonna eat
Not seein' defeat, nigga I just stood to my feet
Cocked every rock that I had, Cooked all the dope I could cook
Took a glance at my family, like it was the final look
Sellin' the shit I stole
Have mercy on my soul
And these shops about to be closed
Cause Fiend about to roll
This ain't no war to stage
Feel the wrath and my rage
It's bieng displayed
At the effect of poverty's case
This ain't no phase, I'm trapped with that want to live
To protect mine, I miss you with rounds of hot shit
My glock eat it, the only talkin' that you get in verbal
And the way of my pain, so for God we gonna hurt you
It ain't personal, with the thought of playin with my math
Can get that ass in an unending bloodbath(bloodbath)

[chorus]

My life has seen shit like this. I got to much will invested
Fuck open chested, me and my workers bullet proof vested
Suggested cause my least worry is bieng arrested
Upset with cause more these niggas done probably confessed it
See I'm blessed with the game, Came along with my name
Tested for fame, Pushin' out crack cocaine
But watch the pain and strange thangs happen for greenary
And involves seein' me, nigga windex ya scenary
Believe in me is one thing, seein' is another
If I'd have known what i know now, I wouldn't have lost my brother
Streets got death to offer to you fast or slow
But some stash you're doe, you could see the casket front row
I know cause I done seen some casualties burn
Plagued  ?
So now them niggas gonna learn
It's my turn
So when the courts ask for a plea
My answer is they fucked up and made a nigga like me

Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got sons of funk,
An me fiend, an my people, master p an silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life.

Verse 1- (fiend)

Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass ""a"" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.

Ughhh! lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave,
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid,

My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend,
I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt,
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell,

Verse 3-(silkk the shocker)

You might catch me, walkin wit my head down,
In the pourin rain,
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain,
I coulda been born son of a king,
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

I walk, high talk, Gs up and soldiers down
I used to bob and weave when I was on that doodoo brown
Face down on the ground, when Slim come around
Or I be forced to bring more noise than the Beats By The Pound
I just got out the pen, so I bounce when I walk
And say ya heard me, every time that I talk
4-4 boys I used to balk, but now I got a glock 40
I feel sorry for any nigga that wanna get naughty
I love fuckin up parties, watchin bitches like Charlie
Ask Magnolia Shorty, that's my people, she could call it

Talk the same way, every since I was yay

I ain't got to show it for nobody, you can see that I ball
3 months, fuck the walker, I was struttin 'fore I crawl
Before the old school even had the, ""Yes, yes, ya'll!""
I was spendin my uneven money on my family in the mall
Young Fiend, was the guard, I breaks rules with it
My ? got grooves with it, cause I packs tools with it
I simply acts a fool with it, roll, represent-a
Wear minks in the winter, Tank iced in the center
My step is the agenda, not only this voice
But they its bout my hips, naw they ain't havin my choice
Now the moral to the story is that I'm cold with it
Made a song about my stroll with it
If you was with it, can ya dig it?

Fill up in this shit, that was ever smokin, you can catch me smokin
On some shit that will have me broken, (cough cough),

No optimos, no keep moving, fuck it, pass the feeling

Choppin off slugs like a mailman in a corvette
Like the weed when I lower my tek
Niggas is seeking, pump down like bricks, in the trunk of the 626
Is something you hate cause your boy
Just got flipped, ak with a strong clip
In the hood I bust you with the tank,
In the pen I trust you with the shank
My mind go blank, I'm a soldier smokin dank
All the way to the motherfucking bank

In the drop where my nigga walk
Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black, I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south
Where the po-po's scout
Everybody, everybody that knows what your bout
Won't leave your house
Cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin
You might connect the grip
Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship
Like the peoples in summertime agent trip
Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a, they be them friends of me
Woah, slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged

A soldier without a pause
I'm prayin about cause, break jaws and all laws
My bullet scars didn't heal, my tatoos reveal
Bout to ride explain a million of hostile
The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives, I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set, families with teks, release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers, we the best fuck all the rest, here hit the cess
Snort, c'mon the test
With the charge the best, cause I open your chest
God bless, I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever, should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks, me, slim, twins, and mac
Gotta attack, with the jest to ask, deftly in the act

I had to scratch to get a nickel, in order to get a dime
But times done change, now I'm havin mines
And I'm protected by the tank, No Limit, and plenty nines
I grinds to the fullest, so when I'm finished I gots to pull it
I'm lookin for that green shit, boy you bite the bullet
For tryin to sell me bullshit
You know I'm lookin for the bombest weed in your town
Now, I'm a smoker

Now you know what that mean?

Niggas try to take me on a ride and leave me stranded black 
Leave me in spots where I can't fly jack 
Ain't that some shit how niggas come and fuck the game up quick 
I was there when G got popped uh dead in the neck 
Around the corner when Melvin got teked up in the chest 
I was up the block when my compadre Coolie Black got shot 
All up on Second and Clara Blocks now check it 
New change was burnin inside motherfuckers like hell 
The only precautionary measure was to take care of self 
And that's the only way you can survive in the game 
And enhance in the game but lord I really must say 
Everything has got a message and a meaning to it 
A purpose, if you don't believe then your day is coming 
Now I'm a tell you Lord, you've gotta overstand me 
Only thing I'm screamin see, uh 
I got a testimony 

[Fiend] 
I got a testimony 
I have a testimony 

[Fiend] 
My testimony starts losin a homie behind somethin phony 
Flippin those zonie's for Rice A Roni 
Lifted by my lonely for only brother to take, well look at his kid 
You can have my life instead of his, I'm serious 
The fear in me is I never felt this much pain in my body 
But you know what, I never drank that much bracardi, lovin his shorty 
Like she was mine and times I showed that baby the path 
And teach it, ain't no such thing just aim it when you blast 
Please be crazy bout your cash and learn to stash that last dollar 
We be like you kenfolk when your broke, a No Limit rider 
So god, when you hear me hollar please grant my request 
Cause killers behind anybody with a tank on their chest

[Skull Duggery] 
In 1970 a hoodlum was born on this earth 
Didn't ask to come here but when I landed it sure did hurt 
It was a trip to see my life split in half 
>From the drug game on the street to the love I showed my mom and dad 
The pain run deep, ha, nigga can't you tell 
Look at the expression on my face, nigga it hurts like hell 
I have a testimony to tell, this life I will never forget 
Let me hit this life boy, rearrange my whole shit 
Look, I was riding up Third Street as usual 
I was gonna bust a left buck I'm on a cell but I left shampoo hotel 
Man it hurts me, scene it horrified me 
I seen a group of little kids having fun ya dig 
nobody botherin them see 
Until this chump drove up with his big shot gun 
And he shot a round of kids, I say boy 
what this nigga did (what this nigga did) 
And the little kid that he shot boy on the block, end his life 
And the kid's name was James ??? right, and that's my testimony 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Now see in my life, it ain't never been what it's supposed to be 
Sometimes my tank dogs feel like they losing me 
Sometimes I just feel they don't understand me 
Cause in my life you never tell me life will bring so much harm 
I never thought to see my homie ??? die with needles in his arm 
And like my homie Derrell Fuller, he never got to see his twins born 
And by the way they couldn't see it because they bullets they took 
they couldn't take it 
And you couldn't tell me that these days in my life 
That I believe in the things that I saw 
Shit, I never knew I had this testimony

No Limit black sheep played the back seat for months 
Stayed away from the Tanqueray bitches and blunts 
Still Mac nigga ain't nothin' changed 
Got the rings and the gold chains 
Now bitches want to know my whole name 
I penetrate em then I disintegrate em 
I let the next nigga date em 'cause I don't hate em 
I spit voodoo to the most hard to get hoes 
And at the end of the night, I rippin' off clothes 
You fuckin' with the realest, from lyrical spillers 
To killers and dealers and cap peelers, and street guerrillas 
From villains to chillers, we made millions 
And paid killers to protect scrilla 
So what the fuck you talk about winners? 
You hear that word camouflage when you hear my name 
I represent the shell shocked 'cause it's in my veins 
(No Limit soldier) is on my left arm, I took it in blood 
Throw your hood up if you a thug 
And all them niggas say

You hear them soldiers on them beats holler 
Every time them soldiers speak holler

Gangstafied Kane and Abel you know the camouflage assassin

The nigga that's catchin these niggas and beatin em down 
'cause they wearin' Tanks, they don't know what the fuck it mean 
Nigga, that's the fuck, that's about punchin' your fuckin' mouth 
The nigga that'll tear the club up 
Nigga, I don't give a fuck if you bangin' or slangin' 
Nigga when I put this Tank up nigga you get rowdy as the fuck 
But if you think I was gonna leave this motherfucker without

Stop the track 'cause these niggas don't know about my click black 
I down with the M to the A to the see

Nigga what I claim? 
Nigga I claim true! 
I hang with niggas that's killers with true tattoos 
I got my name Big Ed from what I put between hips 
I got my name Assassin from the way I empty out clips 
Wear the No Limit soldier, thuggin' at heart 
Hittin' niggas with throw aways when I toss em I break em apart 
Niggas get your guns up if you rowdy 
And when Assassin hit the stores, buy the album if you bout it 
bout it

Young, black and strong
I was meant and sent
Cause' some of the real was all gone
Since birth til' now I got holes in my T-shirt
From fighting with anybody that wants to see me hurt
Took it needle and blood
Second and first love
Fuck giving a fuck
Blame me not the drugs
I motivates myself
Grab a rocket off my shelf
A extra match and now I'm feeling like myself
Without help I could spot and just kill a decoy
Really end what i destroyed

Wanting to give the baby something to follow
But shit I'm smoking like coffee lids
Trying to deal with what is
Screaming letta nigga live
And don't kick the door in my crib
I was off he even found where I lived
Now is it a crime to be black?
And walk the streets wit' cha' gat?
To protect family knock somebody off the map
Distributing crack to put clothes on they back
I did it, and still do it if that's where I'm at
But see I'm best where I'm at
Up in this sack right into this back wood
Wanting everyday to be that good

For how long?
23 years
And I choose to speak my mind even if its my career
The only fear that i discovered ain't returned and ain't coming
And the faith that I have ain't in no car in no woman
Everyday I'm stumbling to a smarter me
A harder me
Revealing my strength for they try to swallow me
I done read what they didn't want me to read
Learn to need what they didn't want me to need
Shit look I really gotta house full of guns
A couch full of ones
Just in case I don't understand the outcome that life taught
Let me leave you with this thought
Why the lion needed courage and he already had heart....

Now spot him I didn't seen, scouted out his team
Get punked, 'fore I jump, bumping that old fiend
Hit a lick and say 'cause, I'm heading to the city 
Incase I don't take him, I think my God won't forgive me

And showed him how to make a missile and snap a bone tissue

Why they wanna replace mine, chance with the killer when I chase mine

And still pop a nigga ass from the rooftop
And still catch the Kiss performance later with the L.O.X.

You play thug in the streets I'm wavin at your chest (nigga)
You heard about me boy, you don't want no drama
I make it hard for you to breathe in the streets
While finessin your baby momma-get your mind right shawty
While you poppin that X, I'ma pop yo chest
And leave you dead in the party like soakin wet

Uh, uh - yo when I'm loadin the clips, niggaz I hate, face be on 'em
That's why I stopped coppin' the guns with safeties on 'em
When I touch down, call me up, I'm on the porch
With the mac, servin niggaz ""Eightballs"" and up
You want to know why niggaz is broke, because they hate money
The rims that I'm sittin on is in they late twenties
Bitches want to see me holla at 'em, throw a dollar at 'em and
If they hustle throw some hard or some powder at 'em
This is for my South niggaz
Gold and platinum ice in they mouth niggaz
Let's ride out niggaz
Everybody gon' follow the bitches
Until they realize, bullets gon' follow the stitches
On the other hand, shit is real low, it's a fact that
Nine out of ten niggaz mouths get 'em killed though
What you ride for? What you die for?
'Cause I got some niggaz and some bitches that's my word that I kill for

She said she was a stripper but she wanted to rhyme
And if I gave her a deal she make her legs stretch back to her spine
I told her hit the treadmill, 'til she run out of time
And in the eve no doubt, she was blowin my mind

I'm from the A-town, put 'em through a GA course
'Cause ""it's all in the game"" like EA Sports
From scams and money grams, there's unions that want to wire me
""You think you know but really don't"" - put it in your ""Diary""

I'm quick to knock 'em out, they comin in three spurts
I do like Spielberg and see that yo' +DreamWorks+
My weed is all lavender, my drink is blue
My gat'll, +Poke-a-Man+, it's the Pikachu

Luda give 'em new perm, now they hair is wet
And they don't want to get on top, cause they scared of heights
So if you Wonderwoman BITCH I'm the Wondermack pro
So shut up and gimme that Thundercat HOOOO

She said she won't, take it off unless there's money involved
I told why'all hold the stack and give hundred a call

Tellin me she humpin harder than why'aaaall

Got got - three niggaz just diggin these balls
And all three really won't see why'all
Outside, in the burgandy Bird
Ruff Rydin puffin the herb, discussin the curb

She said she from B.K.
And I did it ""my way, all day"" like B.K., no more need say
So Fiend playa, you know I'm busy countin some cash
Then bouncin up on some ass

Better yet, think I'm on some extendable hash
You really want to fall in ya glass
She chose me, pimp nigga like we chose to be rich
Double-are then stole ya bitch

Lie to my lady at home, got my baby at home
Man, I was on some shit like 'Kiss, is we ""Fuckin' or What?""
If you don't want to get a room, we can fuck in the truck

Keep my dick sucked like, straws in soda

Then let my toast, put the ghost in niggaz and watch it rise
Yeah I look out for my niggaz, but I'm not a town hero
When I walk, I set fire to the floor like ground zero
I'm the reason niggaz jumpin out of buildings, shit
They better let that hard ground kill 'em then they run down sizzlin
Got a hundred hidden guns in the wall where I live

So if you a thug - throw these slugs!
And not at my vest, throw it at my mug

I could tell bout the dope boys, hoes, and the ballers (ho)
The pimps and the macks, real niggas that what they call us
Hangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us
Put 30's on a Lac to a Benz on brawlers
Standin' on the corner, slagin' crack and stackin' dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer
I ain't never had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')

Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air

And wondered that the man can deprive ya
It's there in black ink
With millions in dirty green had to think
Lives depreciated over drinks
Call me twisted
Rope burns to the neck was insisted
And all his hope turned to ""I guess should I risk it?""
And that's why the law is laid down

Feel me shakin' up that dope in my apartment
And picture me on top of the world and still servin'
Blessin' all my shorties with birds to keep 'em workin'
As long as my hood is tight, my mind is right
Look at the dope line tonight, just doin' alright
For the nugs
Why y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug
This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good
With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's
With the itchy sittin' dead on the seat
For the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down
For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rounds

Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes

And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit
That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit
By-standers got hit up
And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights
Lightin' pilot lights
I would be crept on my a mask on silent nights
Now I'm wonderin' and thinkin', how can a man make a sack ?
Flip a new Lac with his work
End up in the back of hearse
Then be packed in the dirt

He get cracked where it hurts
Feel the automatic when it jerks
Comin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk
Is that what it's worth naw, niggaz got the chrome in ? in the whip
Never let the law get the low on the licks
Bet they got a mob and they mob full of tricks

That I couldn't really understand for awhile

But what brang smiles
And see I guess I was to caught up in those fake niggas
And bitches to know
I guess I was blind by the fast money,
and switches on the 64
They gotta, gotta be a better way out,
then hell or jail
I know I'm wrong for selling dope to my family
Just to get mail

To relieve their stress
But no matter, how much success

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there

Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap

Rest in peace Pac

a lot of people don't realize 
how us young black businessmen down here in No Limit doing it 
But they do understand we making a lot of money 
[C Murder] 
I got it made plus I get paid and paid 
You wanted No Limit so I brought the brigade 
I'm true to the game so I'm draped in tats 
The most valuable player because of my stats 
all the Platinum sales because I'm so gifted 
ya I used to slang I even shop lifted 
When I went to jail and went upstate 
I beat a charge cause my paper was straight 
I wanted a truck so I bought me a Nav 
an I wanted some pussy so I paid for the ass 
I got it made so they call me a made nigga 
If rap was dope I guess I'd be a drug dealer 
I got the feds all over my dealy 
You infiltrate my click, really 
Mothafuckers must like to see theyselves get played 
Cause TRU niggaz gettin' paid 
[Chorus x6] 
We trying to get paid 
[Silkk The Shocker] 
Now I came through the door, I said it before 
Last year I'm worth a little something, this year I'm worth more 
I gots to get paid, I gots to have it made 
Nigga street smarts, my game stay sharp just like a blade 
see I'm a be worth something an see if I don't get killed 
I'm trying to be the first nigga out the projects worth more than a 
mil 
I smash something think about the future so I stash something 
Don't think the money will change me I'm still down to click-click and 
blast something 
See I gots to get cash but I guess it be in time 
now see you gotta get yours I gotta get mine 
And when I get something for niggaz its the most popular kind 
And when I buy something that's for me nigga its top of the line 
Now nigga on the real I gots to fulfill my own dreams 
Fuck going to the game and trying to own my own team 
Nigga believe I scheme shit to dream shit the paper 
Chasin' tryin' to make mils on the real so stop hating 
[Chorus x8]",Get N Paid,2013
Fiend,"Picture this, any man that hustle because like to is a fool.
Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

Fiend,"Huh say man 
You know who get ready bro 
It seems like they don't want a young nigga to get rich 
Make money like we ain't supposed to leave the ghetto
But uh
I ain't trippin' life's a bitch 
You know we was dealt some bad cards but
You know
We gotta deal with it 
Life's hard so lets show em show em show em what's up

My gate way tuh hell seems like its constantly open 
The reaper is callin' so I'm constantly smokin'
See-Murder ain't gonna die in vein 
My ghetto ties got me livin' my life in pain
See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever 
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed 
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts 
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust
I used to think the hood was cool 
But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch 
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

Lord control me 
You know me 
These cards I got to play em 
My life is like a game 
I'm up from a.m. to a.m.
My donner AK hem him 
If he don't have none of my paper man 
If I let him live 
He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now 
But see how us niggas get caught up 
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's 
2 23s 90 degrees
I left them windows down to feel the breeze
My cousin be	 and me and john in the back seat drinkin' off brome 
And to the z
Thinkin' bout the lives we gonna free 
Now tell a nigga please 
Soon as we drove up fuckin' doe was about to close up 
Knocked on the doe 
Nigga hold up you didn't see us rool up
I forced my way in I put my seven to his stars 
No time for thankin'
Is what I'm thankin' kill a bitch what you fittin' tuh say
I went to the kitchen I'm flippin' pans and pots and spoons 
I heard foe glocks
Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room
Its bout that time for us hounds to get 
Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone
Its over 
I come to lay ya eyes buggin' out his head

Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice

I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good

I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?

Niggas like, man you know, let me open doors for niggas
You know, to get they masters, and get they publishing, get they money

Is that niggas ain't reaching back to a nigga, you feel me?
So I's having problems understanding that shit, you know?

It's been a long time coming, for your C, nigga
It was always one hundred in the eyes of a G, nigga

Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

When you see me on the TV show me love 
On the video 
I got a tank around my chest representing my home 
I'm asking all the haters to leave me alone 
And uh much love to the calliope 
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats 
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats 
And my success goes to the man above 
But uh, I'd like to thank my fans for showing me love 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the southside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the northside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the eastside 
Show me love 
All my niggas on the westside 
[Mac] 
When I was underground everybody down 
Everybody show me love, cause I share common ground 
With those niggas that was broke they laughed and joked 
Them niggas was broke too but I'm a rapper so they think I'm not 
supposed to 
But they still on my team cause I got fame 
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name 
Yeah I know Mac, we go back, me and that nigga tight 
As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way 
y'all niggas don't know, I got so much shit I won't say 
I'm damn near breaking in tears as I'm speaking these words 
This same motherfucker from the third, show me love nigga 
Ya heard me, to all my niggas on the southside 
Show me love 
Ya heard me, all my niggas on the northside 
Show me love 
Show a nigga some love nigga 
On the eastside 
Show me love 
And all my niggas on the westside 
[Mr. Serv-On] 
It's four in the morning, mamma got tears in her face 
Love from my tombstone try to relocate 
But in my tank lord I got faith 
Five hundred dollars or so for my block 
Lord knows I couldn't stop 
That's a long way from bad credit cards and selling rocks 
For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down 
Chi town, on my gd's, on six and thirty hos 
And my vl's on the westside 
I ride with jack time ballers 
Drink alazay (?) and hennessee with Jakeville shot callers 
I'm gettin love from niggas on Breakstreet 
And Watts, and Cappanella park and LA 
The thirties in the Bay, brown love for my esses 
That's a long damn way from the parkway 
So when I'm home, see a nigga drop a nigga from above 
(Cmon, cmon) Show me love 
To all my niggas on the westside 
To all my niggas on the eastside 
To all my niggas on the northside 
To all my niggas on the southside 
To all my bangers on the westside 
To all my bangers on the eastside 
To all my bangers on the northside",Show Me Luv,2013

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

[Mya]
It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2] 
[Silk]	
Every woman need a down man
[Mya]		
Every man need a down chick
[Silk]		
Watch your so-called friends
[Mya]		
Watch them niggas you hang around with
[Silk]
I need somebody I can be serious with
[Mya]	
I need somebody I can clown with
[Silk] 	
It's thug love and I think I found it

[Chorus]

[Mya]
Will I fall
For this thug
Will I fall for a thug like you",Somebody Like Me,2013

Fiend,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

[Chorus x2]",Survival Of The Fittest,2013
