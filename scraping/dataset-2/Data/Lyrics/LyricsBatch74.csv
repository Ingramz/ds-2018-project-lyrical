Colin Hay,"Sometimes I'm invisible, I'm nowhere to be seen
And kick like a tin can in the shape of a man
Trying so hard to break in so I can burst out
Perspectives ever changing leaving me in doubt

I've got a chronic disorder, I'm balanced between
The edge of a razor, trying to cut clean
I've got my eyes on the road, I'm trying to keep steady
I've got my hands on the wheel
I feel, I'm nearly ready

Hope that me who's dreaming and that's not me who's screaming
Want to wake up warm in a tattered down tarn
Still for all the killing, there's nobody winning
I want to spit it out, I want to scream and shout

Lying in the gutter, I heard someone mutter
We'll creep in the shadows trying to get home
Like the swing in the see-saw, hard to keep steady
With some rearranging
I feel, I'm nearly ready

Sometimes I'm invisible, I'm nowhere to be seen
Kick like a tin can into a sugared man
Hope that me who's dreaming and that's not me who's screaming
I want to wake up warm in a tattered down tarn

Lying in the gutter, I heard someone mutter
We'll creep in the shadows trying to get home
I've got my eyes on the road, I'm trying to keep steady
I've got my hand, my hands on the wheel
I feel, I'm nearly ready",Circles Erratica,1987

Oh, you're born alone and die the same
In between can take a while
Only one drop in the sea of time
Sometimes makes it hard to smile

If you find someone to share your life
Things are never quite the same
Years we have traveled seem like days gone past
And we've known so little pain

At this point in time I stand alone
To the phone I'm holding on
Outside people stare as if to say
We know there's nobody home

Hold me when you're lonely
Hold me when you're lonely

When the papers read that all is lost
Only darkness lies ahead
I'll speak softly and soothe and chase the fear
And on me you rest your head

When the nights are hot with heavy air
Or it's freezing to the bone
You may lie drunk in the city square
You may feel lost and forlorn

Hold me when you're lonely
Hold me when you're lonely

",Hold Me,1987
Colin Hay,"Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the fire and in the water
Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the streets and on the corners

I always wanted to be like Jack
He's as cool as they come
Yeah, I always wanted to be like Jack
Still for me, he's the one

Someday, someday
Someday, someday

Hear the wind blow through the long grass
I hear laughter in the night
No revelations as the years pass
Just disappear from sight

As I grow older, I grow younger
Every day is like a dream
I wouldn't go back for a moment
Except for maybe seventeen

Someday, someday
Someday, someday

Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the fire and in the water
Everybody's always looking for Jack
In the streets and on the corners

Yeah, even Jack is always looking for Jack
He's always in another room
And when I spoke to the woman there
She said, ""He left this afternoon""

Someday, someday
Someday, someday

Someday, someday
Someday, someday",Looking for Jack,1987
Colin Hay,"I drink good coffee every morning
It comes from a place that's far away
And when I'm done I feel like talking
Without you here there is less to say

Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy
What is closer to the truth
Is that if I lived till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

I'm no longer moved to drink strong whiskey
I shook the hand of time and I knew
that if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

Your face it dances and it haunts me
your laughter is still ringing in my ears
I still find pieces of your presence here
even after all these years

I don't want you thinking that i don't get asked to dinner
cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do
and even though I may seem to feel a touch of love
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

if I live till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you",I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You,1998
Colin Hay,"Did someone call my name?
Like a distant drum is beating
Or is it just another dream along of long ago?
I dance again I am spinning
In the light I am living
And I can feel the power rushing through my veins
Once upon a time I could do no wrong
For the candle flickers, the flame is never gone

To my brilliant feat
They all pay heed
I hear the crowds roar oh so loudly

Is it a game of chance
Or merely circumstances
A jack to a king and back
Then you have to pay to play
The world it won't wait for you
It's got its own things to do
The sun's gotta rise and drive another night away
And as I listen to the silence
I can hear thunder in the distance

To my brilliant feat
They all pay heed
I hear the crowds roar oh so loudly

To my brilliant feat
I make grown men weep
And still my eyes grow oh so cloudy",My Brilliant Feat,1998
Colin Hay,"My my my, It's a beautiful world
I like swimming in the sea
I like to go out beyond the white breakers
Where a man can still be free,
Or a woman if you are one
I like swimming in the sea

My my my, It's a beautiful world
I like drinking Irish Tea
With a little bit of lap sang souchong
I like making my own Tea

My my my, It's a beautiful world
I like driving in my car
Roll the top down,
Sometimes I travel quite far
Drive to the ocean
Stare up at the stars

All around is anger, automatic guns
Death in large numbers, no respect for woman, or our little ones
I tried talking to Jesus, but he just put me on hold
Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
And He could not shake his cold

And still this emptiness persists
Perhaps this is as good as it gets
When you've given up the drink and those nasty cigarettes
Now I leave the party early at least with no regrets
I watch the sun as it comes up I watch it as it sets
Yeah this is as good as it gets

My my my, It's a beautiful world
I like sleeping with Marie
She is one sexy girl full of mystery
She says she doesn't love me, but she likes my company
For now that's good enough for me",Beautiful World,2001
Colin Hay,"All the girls and boys are gone away
They never really had much to say
They took off all their clothes and their shoes
Politely asked to be excused

They're the children on parade
They have secrets that they share
They're the children on parade
And nobody knows, nobody knows

All the broken toys lie on the floor
There's no more laughter from down the hall
Mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Whatever could have happened to them all?

To the children on parade
And all the secrets that they share
They're the children on parade
And nobody knows, nobody knows

All across the world, just yesterday
All the girls and boys just went away
They took off all their clothes and their shoes
I'd love to someday hear all the news

About the children on parade
And all the secrets that they share
They're the children on parade
And nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody knows",Children on Parade,2001
Colin Hay,"Don't wait up
For her tonight
Cause she won't be coming home
Don't wake up
'Till it gets light
By then she'll be long gone

A restless heart has set it's sail
She can feel the waves washing over
She knows what life with you entails
You love her strength you despise your weakness

Don't wait up
For her tonight
'Cause she won't be coming home
Don't wake up
'Till it gets light

You can feel the darkness creeping over
She paid the man and sailed away
Leaving you your incompleteness",Don't Wait Up,2001
Colin Hay,"Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
Life is grand

Doesn't it feel good to be alive
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere

Paint the food through bricks and mortar
Bide my time trying to have some fun
Half past ten I drink a little water
Time stands still

I'm seeing my future slip through my hands
Watch the wind whip through desert sand
Then I remember I'm no ordinary man
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere

It's been years since I was a builder
Working with my head and hands
Dreams of crystal, glass and silver
Gold flashing past

So tantalizing, the things that I've seen
I know you know exactly what I mean
Can't ever look back to where you've been
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere

Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
But life is grand

Doesn't it feel good to be alive
To laugh until the tears roll from your eyes
I'll drink to your health from five miles high
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere
Going somewhere
Going somewhere",Going Somewhere,2001
Colin Hay,"Get out of Hollywood
Drive into the hills
Roll down the top
And just throw away your pills
You'll never forget her
So why do you even try?
Things'll get easier
As the days go creeping by

Broke my heart
Saw it coming from the start
I really hate to see the shape I'm in
Broke all the rules
And you know life can be cruel
But I think it's time I learned to swim

Show me
There still can be some mystery
I haven't found
Throw me
A lifeline to the lost at sea
Don't let me drown

And if I had my way
Tell you what I'd do
Drive down to the lake
Before the sky gets blue
Fill up my bottle
With water from the spring
Because I read somewhere that it cures everything

Broke my heart
Saw it coming from the start
I really hate to see the shape I'm in
Broke all the rules
And you know life can be cruel
But I think it's time I learned to swim

Show me

Colin Hay,"When I first set eyes on you
First you beat me up
Then you kissed me too
We'd throw stones into the sea
There were no others there
Just you and me
Across the bridge and down the lane
I knew I loved you then
You said you did the same

Oh maggie, what have you done?
I should have seen it coming
Into your sight I'd run
Oh maggie, come to me tonight
I will wait up for you
Make sure you're alright
I miss you

You taught me how to sink or swim
When I was scared that day
You just pushed me in
And when nobody was around
You let me kiss you then
There the love I found
I said I'd never let you go
You just smiled at me
How was I to know?

Oh, maggie, what am I to do?
How I can live with only memories of you?
Oh, maggie, tell me the truth
When your ship was sinking
Did you think it through?
I miss you

You were the fountain of my youth
And when I fumbled
You showed me what to do
And when we were both seventeen
You left me standing there
But you were never mean
And when I saw you out with him
He looked much older
And you looked very thin

I hadn't heard from you in years
And then your mama called
She couldn't speak for tears
She said you left me a note
Inside my pocket burns
With these words you wrote

Hey darling boy, don't you cry for me
I am forever yours
Now that I am free
We'll be together
Throw stones into the sea
They'll be no others there
Just you and me
I miss you
Maggie's gone

I think you came the other night
You stroked my brow
Your eyes were full of light
May have only been a dream
But I would walk with you
To places I never have been
Maggie's gone",Maggie,2001

The boys are cockin' up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is can we all come

Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying

Take a look
At how we looked so good together

What you don't know won't hurt you
You're hurting now you know, you know

Something good
Something good has got to happen
And if I wait it'll be too late
For something good, something good

At least I'm good at something
Now I just wish it was something good

Something good, something good
Something good has got to happen
And if I wait, it'll be too late
For something good, something good

When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when Old Saint Nick
Takes a lick on the peppermint stick

He'll come a flyin' from a higher place
And fill the stocking by the fire place
So you'll, have a yule that's cool

Yeah, from Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright

He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the boys and girls

The ghosts are still careenin' through the halls
The drunken neighbor sings his favorite song
In the stardust of the night
Before the dawn

You never really know just who your friends are
Till you find out at last who they are not
You never recognize the things you really want
Till you remember all the dreams that you forgot

We've been runnin' for so long against the grain
Tryin' to find a way to turn around again
Trouble in your heart will soon be gone
It's lonely blue, it's only true
Before the dawn

Come here darlin' lay down by my side
Well the big star's falling and the moon will turn the tide
The whistle of the wind will lead us on
Here we are, not too far
Before the dawn
Well here we are, not too far

I saw how easy I could fall
I chased you down and I gave you the rest
Because I wanted you to have it all

Wasn't that enough love, baby
When I gave you everything I had?
Wasn't that enough love, darling
For you to give me just a little bit back?

Every little thing that you asked of me
You know I'd do it just for you
And if you didn't like my loving ways
Darling, I would change that too

I pledge myself to you alone
Didn't want anyone else
But you weren't ever going love no one

Got to find my sugar somewhere else

When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;

Colin Linden,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home
And my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know

Lie-la-lie

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains",The Boxer,2003

We kicked around
From stairway to station
We made a sensation
With the gadabout crowd
And oh, what a bargain
We're two easy targets
For the old men at the off-tracks
Who've paid in palaver
And crumpled old dollars
Which we squirreled away
In our rat trap hotel by the freeway
And we slept-in Sundays

Your cool was contagious
At the old school
You left without leaving
A note for your grieving
Sweet mother, while
Your brother was so cruel
And here in the alleys
Your spirits were rallied
As you learned quick to make a fast buck
In bathrooms and barrooms
On dumpsters and heirlooms
We bit our tongues.
Sucked our lips into our lungs
Till we were falling
Such was our calling

And here in our hovel
We fuse like a family
But I will not mourn for you
So take off your makeup
And pocket your pills away
We're kings among runaways
On the bus mall
We're down
On the bus mall

Among all the urchins and old Chinese merchants
Of the old town, 
We reigned at the pool hall
With one iron cue ball
And we never let the bastards get us down
And we laughed off the quick tricks
The old men with limp dicks
On the colonnades of the waterfront park
As 4 in the morning came on, cold and boring, 
We huddled close
In the bus stop enclosure enfolding
Our hands tightly holding

Colin Towns,"I used to be a sinner, used to have my cake and eat it
They warned me of my fate, but I was quite prepared to meet it
You'll go to Hell they smiled at me
And told me of the roaring fires
But I was happy living wild
And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

I knocked on the pearly gates
Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through
I smiled, threw my hands in the air
Laughed and got arrested
They said hey man, you're in the wrong place
Your behaviour is a disgrace
Here we pray every hour, on the hour
Read extracts from the Bible and look solemn'
What, says I, no party?
No party?
Let me out

Let me out of Heaven
I got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Let me out, I just can't stay here

Well I ran around in the state of shock and panic
This wan't what I expected
Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me
If you want to go to Hell you've really got to be bad
Okay, okay, I'll be bad
Too late
What do you mean too late
Too late
No
In the meantime

Let me out of Heaven
I've got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Oh God, it's awful here
Going crazy in Heaven
Take me out and let me go to hell
No laughing in Heaven
Don't laugh, this place is Hell",No Laughing in Heaven,1981
Colin Towns,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Upon finding you there,

Through the shrieks of the crowd
Came your careless self
Your oh-so-couldn't careless self.
And you just pass me by,
Your friends catch my eyes
""we know you love her,
We saw you dancing with her shadow"".

Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride

But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather!

About the two of us from different worlds.
I love you so much that it hurts inside,
Are you listening?

Can't we try just a little less pride?

That it tears me up inside.

I hear you on the telephone with God knows who,
Spilling out your heart for free.
Everyone needs someone they can talk to,
Girl, that someone should be me.

So many times, I tried to tell you,
You just turned away.

How did I know?

My life is changing so fast now,
Leaves me lonely and afraid.

And all that could mean.
Another year ends and then begins
It's all just a dream.
Still I'm going to love you where I stand,
If I stand at all.
Still I'm going to do the best I can.

She wished under the stars and winter sand.

So I jump for joy
And I sing out loud.
And her smiling face
Makes me proud.
And this frozen world
Somehow it all falls down.
Somehow...
I jump for joy
And I sing out loud.
And her smiling face
Makes me proud.
And this frozen world
Somehow it all falls down.
Somehow it all falls down.
Somehow it all falls down.

My next breath has never been assured

You can’t stop me now
You won’t stop me now
Who could stop me now
It’s all inside
And well defined
As life

Pride leads the course of you
Meant to strike our souls inner core
Locked out once again to prove
That I’ve been through this shit times before

You can’t stop me now
You won’t stop me now
Who could stop me now
It’s all inside
And well defined

You can’t stop me now

Are you too far away?
Is it the distance I keep?

Only to end helpless like a newborn child

Why can’t I have you tonight?
Why can’t I have you tonight?
Why can’t I have you?

Why can’t I have you?
Now the day has drawn
Is it the love you require
Or the love I have shown?

All these nights I'm freed beneath the light of the moon
Just to be held hostage with the thoughts of you

Why can’t I have you tonight?
Why can’t I have you tonight?
Why can’t I have you?

I’m lost but found when it comes to you

Let's go down to the river
Let's go back to the sea
Let's go swim in the ocean

And emotions we owe
You're just a, you're just a constant reminder of each other we chose
So when we falling out
A new subject to learn
That's when tradition starts
And love returns

Let's go down to the river
Let's go back to the sea
Let's go swim in the ocean
Just you and me

When conversation fails
And we're left here all alone
Let's refer back to basics
That were there all along
Whether Sunday morning drive
Or a late-night hang
It's always, always, always you and me babe

Let's go swim in the ocean

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

And you can move my body but please keep my mind asleep

I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies

And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free
'Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality
It's not enough for me to paint with black and white
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life
You think you travel far and never seen the stars
'Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that far

Where you used to play

So you hurry on back there
Even leave your pool and your car
Only to find you no longer belong

Yeah, hit the streets at midnight
Still dancing after dawn
But something seems to be missing
Just what are you running from

Do you like your love in the dark
Or laid out in the sun?

Don't you know what you've become

You can always hear me singing
Oh, say can you see?

To the hills of Beverly

All those boys on Broadway

You know you go either way

I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Who had to fall to rise again?

Dust yourself off,

One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon

I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

I spoke to god

Amazing in the maze of cliches

Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, Hope hell never come back

The devil jealous in fact, Cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to god, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said lord would you help?

And of course, I gotta thank myself

And not my pocket health in its ashes

By that blue magic in your eyes

Though I should run and hide from this illusion
Your smile is so much quicker than my pride
There's something up your sleeve 
That makes my heart believe inside

This carpet ride might lift us up 
And fly us to forever
But up till now 
It's all been slight of hand
I've got to face the fact one look and 
I'm right back again at your command
Cause that old blue magic

Collin Raye,"Well listen dear I think it's clear we need to sit and talk
Seems you've got this notion I've been having second thoughts
Well I must confess in a way I guess that silly notion's true
Cause every second you're not here with me I think of you
Every second every minute every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask if I have second thoughts I guess I'd have to say
Every second every minute every hour of every day

Now I propose we drink a toast and turn the lights down low
Put our favorite music on and hold each other close
Don't worry dear you'll always be here in my heart to stay

Every second every minute I love you more and more each day",Every Second,1991

I can count on you to start
Bringing back sweet memories

I know you'll be here right on time 
To tear me up again
You never stay away too long 
And give me a chance to mend
Tears won't drown your fire in me 
It's even worse when it rains

You never stray from a faithful old flame
Just when I think you're gone 
You start the fire 
And I yearn for your touch
That I miss so much
Embers of love glow even brighter 
Than they did yesterday 

They won't go away

So many roads but none that seem clear
Is what we have enough to last a whole life through
Who knows baby who knows
So you're asking me what do we do

Cause time moves so fast and the chances seem so few
Is it too much to think that we could have it all
Who knows we may never know

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all it's worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you I'd fall in love with me

So hold me close I'll kiss away your fears
I won't promise the moon but I promise to be here

It's not the love we knew that hurts me but the love we could have known
I'm not sorry that I held you I just wish that I still could

I don't regret one moment that we had together
What's killing me is knowing we could've had forever
I just wish we loved each other the way I know we could
Oh it's not that it was so bad it just could've been so good

I don't want to lose the mem'ries of all the nights we shared

Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me
He said, ""Boy, you might not understand
But a long, long time ago
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none
But I loved your grandma so""

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter, and this is what it said

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see
And between now and then, 'til I see you again
I'll be loving you 
Love, me

I read those words just hours before
My grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church
Where me and grandpa stopped to pray
I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her
His eyes filled up with tears

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through

Since you said goodbye
With just one little word 
You wrote me right out of your life
You found a new prince charming 
Now I'm a royal shade of blue

Then you took me to St Louis later on down the river

His old man told many a tale
How his great grandad used to go drovin' 
Back and forth on the Oachezown Trail
Now you might say the boy got infected 
By a fantasy of the old west

For his heart and his soul got connected 
To a spirit that won't let him rest
Now he don't wear spurs that go jingle 
He don't spend his nights round a fire
He lifts diesel oil that is horses required
But he is a latter day cowboy 
Dressed as a truck driving man
Driving his wheels 
And his dreams to Cheyenne

He beds down by the side of the highway 
At the sight of the first evening star
In the darkness his big pony idles 
As he quietly strums his guitar
And he sings out a song of his sweetheart 
Even as her sweet mem'ry grows dim
And he sings of the trail he has chosen 
But the actual fact is the trail chose him
Now he don't wear spurs that go jingle

Yes he is a latter day cowboy

Go to my head.

When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?

It ain't my style to over heat,
Much less burn.

All at once I flashed right past the point,
Of no return.

The sun was on the rise,
And any stars that hadn't set,
Had fallen in my eyes.

He set his sights on the past
Finished his glass

To the casual eye it's a bar stool
But it's really much more than it seems
A few drinks and then
She'll be with him again
As he sits on the time machine

Like all pioneers
He swallowed his fears
And watched the whole room fade to black
He's dying to go
But he's no fool, he knows
How hard it will be to come back
But tonight he's tired of the lonely
And tomorrow will not be the cure
So he'll just slip away
Find yesterday
And spend one more night with her

Now, as far as these customers can tell
He's just one more fool who talks to himself
But every man in this place would line up
If they knew what that seat really was (but)

Collin Raye,"He came to town on an old freight train
He jumped off in the pouring rain
Everybody said he's insane
Just a low down no account hobo

He made his bed beneath the county bridge
The city folks said hey that's not his
They signed a petition they're gonna get rid
Of that low down no account white trash

On an old freight train in a hobo hat
Will we let him in or turn our back

She couldn't help what her mama used
It wasn't like she got to choose
Now she's layin' there all alone

Doctor says she might stand a chance
If somebody takes her home

What if Jesus comes back like that
Two months early and hooked on crack
Will we let him in or turn our back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that

Nobody said life is fair
We've all got a cross to bear
When it gets a little hard to care
Just think about him hanging there

He came to town on a cold dark night
A single star was his only light
The baby born that silent night
A manger for his bed

What if Jesus comes back like that
Where will he find our hearts are at
Will he let us in or turn his back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Will he cry when he sees where our hearts are at

Singing sweetly over the plains

Why your joyous strains prolong
Say what may the tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly

Come, adore on bended knee

The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my credo 'til mornin' is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in my tender care
And take us to Heaven, to live with Thee there

Was to certain poor Shepard's in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Then they looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night

Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the north-west
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

Collin Raye,"One frozen night in 1914 at the height of World War One
The unthinkable happened
All along the entire western front
The British and German soldiers lay down their weapons
In an unofficial cease fire to celebrate Christmas Eve together

They exchanged gifts and saw each other as brothers
And that peace lasted for two more days
When they were ordered back to battle

In those few days, though
Men remembered the reason for Christmas
Amongst the devastation
And it's a story that should never be forgotten

Through the smoke filled night
Silence rolls from both sides
Across a bloody battlefield
It was a cold Christmas Eve in 1914
For those who were there it seemed unreal

As time was still, the spirit moved the soldiers
To lay down their arms, raise their voice in song
And pretend for a while the war was over

If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last

As opposing sides approached
Through broken words they spoke
It wasn't long before they felt at ease
They shared their cigarettes
What they had they used as gifts
They didn't feel like enemies

With candles lit, they stood shoulder to shoulder
And on that field they found true common ground
And as they prayed, they dreamed the war was over

If it could happen then, it could happen again
A world torn apart to join hands and hearts
To celebrate His birth, peace on this earth
If for one magic night, we could find again a reason not to fight
Maybe, there's a chance, this time it might last

If it could happen then, it could happen again

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

And in His name, all oppression shall cease

Let all within us praise His holy name

you said you'd love me forever, then you said 'It's over""
and left me without the missing link.
Well I thought I'd forget you, but I guess I forgot to,
and lately I've been too confused to think.
When I reach for someone new, it's like I'm touching you.

I can still feel you just as close as skin, every now and then.
All by myself, in a crowded room, on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you.
I can still feel you

In everything that moves,
in everything I do

I can still feel you just as close as skin, every now and then.
All by myself, in a crowded room, on my empty bed.
There's a place you've touched with your love no one gets close to
I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you.

See you playing in the leaves
It's amazing how a little girl 
Means all the world to me
When I tell you that I love you 
I love you more than words can say
Smile say cheese pretty please 
I want to take your picture
How'd you ever get so big 
I gotta take your picture
And hold on to the mem'ry before 
The whole things slips away
I wish I could save these moments 
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop 
The world from turning 
Keep things just the way they are
I wish I could shelter you from 
Everything not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't 
But I wish I could

When you kiss me for no reason 
It goes straight to my heart
When I feel your arms around me 
I almost fall apart
It's time for bed 
You whisper ""daddy we forgot to pray""

With all your boxes and your broom

Don't even leave one little speck of dust 
Make sure you've got it all
Take my heart, take my soul, 
Take it all with you when you go
Just leave the floor here 
To catch me when I fall
You stole my pride and dignity 
You took it all away from me
Take one last look around, girl 
Before you leave 
And make sure you've got it all

Don't even leave one photograph

Take the sandbox and the swings

To see you with someone new and you were wearing my old blue shirt
But it didn't kill me until we said hello
And I became someone you used to know

Like a friend like a fool like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love didn't we share or don't you even care
I know we said we were through but I never knew how quickly I would go
From someone you loved to someone you used to know

If you didn't tell him about those weekends at the coast
Or how we use to argue about who loved who the most
Well, I guess I won that one cause I still need you so
But to you I'm just someone you used to know

The one that the state's not about to repair
From where I'm falling I think I might meet you
Below where we were just above just don't care
The way the world's changing I just can't accept it

No right or wrong all in between
The faith we were raised on is weathered and shaken
But baby it don't have to be
Cause I still believe in a prayer before supper
Passing the time round the old courthouse square
We've got nothing to keep us from start over Georgia
We'll leave all the baggage and start over there

Well I've never been to that part of the country
Save for some old movies and deep in my mind
Where it's accepted and even rewarded
To stand on your own right side of the line
Nobody wins here we're all scared of losing
I feel scarred right down to the bone
Maybe we'll find ourselves close to the ocean
Where freedom first breathed on it's own

You've kept holding on to me 
Through all the trials and tears
Only you and I could know all 
The sacrifices that let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could've said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I
We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter 
I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough 
To fight together in this thing for life

There were times I lost my mind took 
Some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control 
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fadin' fast
We held each other close until the rain have passed
We're survivors

Seen us through the years

The lights came on bright
Years of heavy weight 
In a moment turned light
I'd thought love could only look dark 
As if through a glass
I just turned into an open book 
Readin' easy at last
Tonight my walls came down like 
A brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground I'm not sure when
But baby you're how the walls came down

I've never trusted much 
Got my reasons like most
Stayed well protected from 
Every thorn on each rose
Taking those wayward trips 
Only to turn back and run
Sailing all my relationships 
Could not have dreamed up this one
Tonight my walls came down

You make sense to me in a world where 
Just a few things do make sense to me
In your heart I'll put my trust 
Through whatever is in front of us
Tonight my walls came down

By my faith I know you're there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day

I thank you for your help
I know you're listening so I know I'm not alone
I feel you here with me as we all face the unknown

Where no one's hurt and no one's scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget

Don't you sit and judge me
From some high and mighty seat

Until you've walked a mile in my bare feet

With harder cards than yours in life to play

And I put her in the car

Shot in the head

There were whiskey bottles and dope by his chair
And a starving baby with nothin' to wear

So I took the cuffs off her
And I took her back in
I wiped off the gun
And wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been

And the morning paper told in black and white

And if you're mine
You'll come flying back some day

Well I'm taking you with me

Collin Raye,"She was singin' ?Love Me Tender? at the local karaoke
I knew right then and there I had found my one and only
She takes my breath away every time I see her
I just couldn't wait for all my boys to meet her
She's got season tickets and sweet, pouty lips
She's all that, well equipped

She's all that, she loves to ride in my pickup truck
She's all that, Mom and Daddy can't believe my luck
She's all that, she looks so good we never wait in line
She's all that, she's all mine

She can throw a split finger and she's got her own glove
When she sinks a twenty footer, man i know I'm in love
Saturday night, she's like a time bomb tickin'
She looks better on Sunday than Mama's fried chicken
She only gets mad when she misses sportscenter
She's all that, even tempered

She's all that, she swings a nine handicap
She's all that, she looks sexy in a baseball cap
She's all that, she makes me want to lay it all on the line
She's all that, she's all mine

Whoa she's a perfect combination
Whoo, she got my defense off the field
Oh, every day's an education
She's got my head a spinnin' like a spoke inside a wheel

She's all that, I'm in touch with her feminine side
She's all that, let me tell you, man, it's one sweet ride
She's all that, a hum-dinger, boy, straight off the blocks
No doubt about it that girl rocks

She's all that, the girl is all that
She's all that, the girl is all that
She's all that, the girl is all that

Who had all the answers
The one I would lean on
For comfort, for strength
She's never forgotten
One grandchild's birthday
Now she can't remember my name
And it makes me so angry
I shake my fist
And cry out to the heavenly one
Why would you play
Such a cold hearted trick
I thought your job was to love
And the answer came down from above

She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use
'Cause people and places
Memories and faces
Are just way too heavy it seems
To carry on angel's wings

This is the woman
Who saw things so clearly
The one who could pick out
One crumb on the floor
She saw through a white lie
Saw me through love's eyes
She hardly can see anymore
And it makes me so sad
And it just isn't fair
Why should so much be taken away
But when I cry out
For all that she's lost
I silently hear someone say

She's gonna fly
When her time here is through
First she'll have to let go
Of some things she can't use
'Cause people and places

Collin Raye,"was young and so was she
Love didn't stay a mystery for very long
We could do no wrong
Then she called to say
She was late
So we took a little drive upstate
And took care of that
Yeah, we just took care of that

Now I'm looking back on
Some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living
With water and bridges

My old man
He had it rough
Cause like his daddy
When he drank too much
He'd get mean
And take it out on me
So with angry words
I was gone
And I never even tried to come back home
The night he died
Momma said he apologized

Now I'm looking back on

Now that it's much too late to change

The things that only time can numb
I guess that's why everyone is given

Like moon light on the sea
The way your body calls me
Like a secret melody
The way you start a fire

The way you always love me
Until I'm satisfied

There are moments

Collin Raye,"I remember when baseball was everything
It was little league, but what a big game
There were two men on and one man out
I got a fastball hanging outside
I swung that bat with all my might
And the ball was gone
They say I knocked the cover off
It was the only homer that I ever had
You should of seen my dad

[Chorus]
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me
As long as I'm holding on
Heaven wouldn't ask it of me
The devil on a good day ain't that strong
I'm keeping it here inside me
As long as I live and breathe
The ball was soaring and the crowd was roaring
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me

I was nineteen, it was a good job
Moving TV's on a loading dock
Till the boss said, ""son
Try to lose every seventh one
I got it worked out with a good friend
Keep your mouth shut, and we'll cut you in
Now what do you say
Don't you want to be rich one day""
I lost a real good job that night
But I kept my pride

[Chorus]

And sometimes it feels like
My best years are behind me
Then somehow, out of nowhere
Something sneaks up to remind me
Like this morning, I woke up
To a little voice that spoke up
Saying, ""daddy, please
Fix a bowl of rice krispies
You're the bestest friend that I ever had
You know I love you dad""

I could hear my own heart beating, when you laid your head on my chest. 
No telling how long it was since the last song
With the band gone and the lights all faded.
All alone on that gym floor, dancing with no music playing.

Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your mama?s white dress
Rice in your hair, your shoes in one hand, and one hand caressing my neck.
The light from the moon filled that old hotel room
As my hands closed around your waist.
And we were holding each other, dancing with no music playing

Ohhhh, there's nothing to say
Youuu take me away
Dancing with no music playing
Oh, dancing with no music playing

Me in my old faded Levi?s, you in your blue cotton dress
Time it don't have no effect on the way that you still steal my breath. 
As we spin once more across the cold kitchen floor,
Your warm cheek touches my face,
And I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing
Oh, I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing

I was lost
On the outside
I almost gave up
I almost put love aside
Then I saw you
A little spark, then a flame
I felt the blood rush a million miles an hour
Through my veins
I'm not ready for this
One last breath and a kiss
'Cause my heart knows you're the one
And baby living without you
Would mean living is done
I'd say

Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words ""I love you""
There would be no point
No reason to live
Without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world

So stop the war
Bring back the light
Life without you
Would be like autumn leaves
In black and white
Didn't we have it all
More depth than the sea
It's cruel to take a fragile heart
And promise love that life can't keep
I'm not ready to fall
Just let go of it all
'Cause I don't wanna love just to lose
I heard it's sad
But the life you live is the life that you choose
But without you

Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words ""I love you""
There would be no point
No reason to live
Without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world

Everywhere I see your face
(I see your face)
I see your grace
And then it's gone
I can't walk on
I can't walk on

Turn off the sun

Oh, there would be no point
No reason to live
'Cause without you girl
Losing you would mean
The end of the world

Church bell ringing right outside

I dig down and give him five

Yeah that's the truth, amen

Nothin' sweeter in this world than your love

If you could see me now
Kneeling on this floor
Watching the memories dance
Holding the flower you wore

You said that was your greatest fear

I'm writin' this letter, my darlin, from high on a hill.

We've been marchin' ten days and we're just outside Hawkinsville.

It's been snowin' all night and we ain't got no more kersosene.

It's colder than hell,

Hope you're doin' well,

Josephine.


There's a fever in camp and our boys are too sick to fight.

We done lost ol' Calvin;

Weaver won't make it through the night.

I overheard the Captain say it's the worst he's ever seen.

I'm losin' some weight

but I'm still standin' up straight,

Josephine.


CHORUS

Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.

Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.

Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right

And just one more thing:

I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.


There's three thousand Union troops camped at the river below.

And six hundred of us -

At least there was two nights ago.

Will Irwin deserted and

They hung him down by the stream.

Good God, I'm so scared,

Keep me in your prayers,

Jospehine.


The order came down: we attack tonight at nightfall.

If we can stop 'em right here

We can win this war, once and for all.

You know, I killed a Union boy last week -

Bet he wasn't fourteen.

He looked just like our son,

Forgive me for what I've done,

Josphine.


CHORUS

Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.

Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.

Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right

And just one more thing:

I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.


And lastly, my darling, in case I should be killed...

Don't grieve me too long

Promise me that you will

Marry another and don't let him treat our babies mean,

And when he's holding you, won't you think of me too, Josephine?


CHORUS

Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.

Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.

And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love lights shines
All around us

So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the summer nights
With your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Just let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

There's a reason for the warm, sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love lights shine
All around us

So let the wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Oh, feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back, no, you can't hold back

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel

Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

There's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Well, you started out with nothin'
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawlin'
Slap you on the back and say, ""Please, please""

Tryin' to make some sense of it all
But I can see, it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right

Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawlin'

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs

There's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right

Someone shoots a gun
In the midnight air.
And I don't know why.
Somebody lives, somebody dies;
Somebody wrongs and a mother cries.
And I don't know why.

Some things we'll never understand;
Other things you change if you can.

Peace, you'll find it where the heart is,
And the heart is right where love lives,
And love can always find a way.
Hope is something that reminds us,
It's not too late to find us.
One day we may be in peace.

Haven't spoken in thirty years
After angry words and bitter tears.
And I don't know why.
Best of brothers and best of friends;
One mistake and their story ends.
And I don't know why.

Other things you change if you can.

With God as my witness
I want to live to see peace.

It's not for me I ask, but my children's souls to keep
It seems the world is going crazy
And though I need to do my share
Could you please take them under wing
Watch over them especially
Keeping them safe from everything
This is a mother's prayer
I know you're listening in the silence of this night
The news is blistering but I hold on to your light
And though there's darkness all around us
By my faith I know you're there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day
This is a father's prayer
I know I can't do this by my self
I thank you for your help
I know you're listening so I know I'm not alone
I feel you here with me as we all face the unknown
Could you return us to your garden
Where no one's hurt and no one's scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget
Teach us to love as you love

This is a father's prayer
Teach us to love as you love

This is the moment

Every endeavor
I have made ever
Is coming into play
Is here and now today

This is the moment
This is the time
When the momentum
And the moment are in rhyme

Give me this moment
This momentous moment
I'll gather up my past
And make some sense at last

This is the moment
When all I've done
All of the dreaming, scheming and screaming
Becomes one

This is the day
Just see it shine
When all I've lived for
Becomes mine

This is the moment
This is the hour
When I can open up tomorrow
Like a flower

And put my hand to
Everything I planned to
Fulfill my grand design
See all my stars align

This is the moment
My final test
Destiny beckoned I never reckoned
Second best

I won't look down
I must not fall
This is the moment
The sweetest moment of them all

This is the moment
Damn all the odds
This day or never
I'll sit forever with the Gods

When I look back
I will recall
Moment for moment, this was the moment
The greatest moment of them all

A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl

Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy

In June of forty-three there was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U.
Who did not feel the need to be elected

They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Atilla the Hun
A bomb or two and very few objected

Yeah, just one shell and governments fall like flies, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye

On knowing the right fella to be stellar

Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
That's how we get the government we deserve

Now the man behind the President calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Peron, would be dictator

He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later

Yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die
They haven't a chance, bye bye
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Peron was biding time out in the slow lane

Yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of San Juan, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Keep away from the wall
But one guy was having a ball
The tragedy, a golden chance for Peron

He organized a concert with incredible flair
In aid of all the victims, such a grand affair
Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor

It was January twenty-second, 1944

And you will be with God

Papa, papa, I do not understand
Are you all right?
Why did you go away

Cosette, my child
Am I forgiven now?
Thank god, thank god
I’ve lived to see this day

It’s you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It’s you who must forgive a thankless man
It’s thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home
To you

Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try.

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
The man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy.

Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory.

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God.

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of the people
Who are climbing to the light.

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies.
Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise.

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord.
We will walk behind the plowshare
We will put away the sword.
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward.

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Porque no hay ninguna como ella (Dile Flow)
Ella si que es fuera de lo normal
Ella es mi gatita de piel canela

Y si la vieras como lo menea
Y si la vieras como mueve sus caderas
Es que todo el mundo a ella la desea
No me la toques esa si es mi nena
Y si la vieras como lo menea

No me la toques esa si es mi nena
Esa si es mi nena, mi gatita piel canela

Oye este es Julio Voltio El Chamako

La llamo al celu ella rápido se pela
De la nada asikalao voy pasando por la escuela
Ninguno de esos locos que le tiran se la llevan
Yo ando full mami dale te espero afuera
Ponte en piel canela mucho cuerpo poca tela
Me modela parece de revista de novelas
Ta' loca conmigo quiere que le de gabela
Si se pega otra me cela esta si es canela

Y si la vieras como lo menea
Y si la vieras como mueve sus caderas

No me la toques esa si es mi nena

La gata es piel canela
De seguro que va' a ser mi nena
Si la pillo esta noche te voy a dar candela
To' el mundo se emociona cuando mueve esas caderas
Ella es lo mas duro que a sali'o de la carretera
Sin fronte y si sin guille con corte y con estilo
Si me dejas mamita te robo par de besitos
Dale mami tirate conmigo la maroma
Mujer es el CFlow Subo por su aroma
Tu eres mi morena y estas bien buena
Ponte ahi pa' que veas lo que te espera
Se trepa encima y se desespera
Le gusta que se lo haga de mil maneras

Y yo la salí a buscar
Porque que no hay ninguna como ella
Ella si que es fuera de lo normal
Ella es mi gatita de piel canela

Y si la vieras como lo menea

Para hallar otro querer
Que me quiera siempre más y más 
Y yo poder corresponder.

Si hay verdad en mi cariño
Busco la felicidad 
Con mi corazón de niño.

El amor en mi pasado
Por no haberlo comprendido
Muchas veces me olvido.

Ya no es así, ahora hay luz del universo
Vivo feliz, la vida me da los versos 
Que son mi sentir, Y son para ti.

No me digan que es muy tarde ya
Para hallar otro querer
Que me quiera siempre más y más 
Y yo poder corresponder.

Alivian el descontento
Esta es mi felicidad
Traen amor los cuatro vientos.

El amor en mi pasado
Por no haberlo comprendido
Muchas veces me olvido.

Ya no es así,
Mi familia ya es muy grande
Vivo feliz, por la calle va una parte

Para hallar otro cariño que me mime como un niño
Y yo poder corresponder, corresponder.

Nunca es tarde en el juego de la vida
Por eso sigo pa’lante pa’lante mama.

Ay mira cosa buena que yo sufro
Y eso a mi me hace llorar.

Yo necesito un cariño que me sepa comprender
Y su amor me quiera dar.

No, no, no, no, no me lo digas
No me lo digas, no me lo digas mama.

Si los de atrás corren más, mira camará

Me hace falta carretera tengo que darle al pedal.

No hay tiempo para tristezas 
Pues hoy estoy decidido, y busco felicidad.

No daré la espalda al amor, 
Jamás seré vencido te lo digo camará.

Confine lo dichoso, pues aprendí la lección
Y tu va a ver, y tu va a ver, tu verás.

Llegas a tiempo en el ocaso de mi vida triste.

Yo estoy buscando una nena como tu que me quiera, 
No me vayas, no me vayas a fallar.

En el juego de la vida todos pierden y yo no, 
Porque yo quiero ganar.

Yo ya arregle mi cabeza, y sufrir no me interesa
Yo quiero tranquilidad.

Llegue a tiempo, no me digas que es muy tarde,
Si no me quieres y anda dime la verdad.

Y lo voy a encontrar, lo voy a encontrar.

You know, you know
Well I be
Bumping California Love on the West Side
Thanking God for the weed, women, and the sunshine
Dumb hot
Out on Sunset
Blowing kush
From the one time
You get a contact
Catch ya ass at the red light
Wanna run at 'em sideways in a Hellcat
On some run flat
By the way I
Never seen a better view, not in Malibu
Bunch of bad bitches naked in the swimming pool
Hear the waves crashing, playing spades in the living room (Cracking)
Sound like a Doggystyle interlude
Kurupt Gotti, nigga where the gas at?
Moon rock got me acting like I never had shit
From Bankhead to a Hollywood address
Same nigga tho
One on one get your ass kicked
Respect it more than a tad bit
Every hood every set though
Sheesh!
One time for the West Coast
LA, the Bay, from Sacramento out to San Diego, California

Stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

Palm trees in the air, the top pushed back
Blowing smoke out the roof cookies to be exact
I'm always in Cali cause this is where it's at
Bitches, bud, good weather, what you know bout that
Where all the fly bitches ride Benzs and Beamers
They either wanna be an actress, or a singer
I'm at the strip club on Sunset, throwing singles
With this bad bitch from Compton, pouring lean up
Breaking down backwoods, rolling gasoline up
Left the Laugh Factory, pulled up in Inglewood
I fuck with some crips and I fuck with some bloods
And I fuck with some esé
My stash house in the Valley
Welcome to my palace
Just went and killed two shows out in Dallas
Selling OG from LA and crates from the Bay

Stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

You know I gotta show the West love
I had to take a trip to Cali for the best bud
I been chilling with the goons, yeah the real thugs
Went to Sacramento nigga met a real plug
I said I'm looking for the gas where the kill at
Want the strong gotta go where the hill at
I met a bad bopper chilling out in Frisco
Like to sip the lime-a-ritas and the sisco
I hopped my ass on the 101 and headed north
And when I hit the hill I found what I was looking for
I'm feeling like a leprechaun with a pot of gold
Bags of the gas yeah the Colonel got a soul
I fly a bitch from the A with 100 racks
Put her ass in a rental told her run it back
Fly another bitch in with 200 more
Welcome to California the State of gold

Stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

Somebody fly me out to 'Frisco
Oakland, San Jose, or Vallejo
Shout out to EPA, Sacramento
Where they keep a nigga laced with all the good smoke
I wanna fly out to LA
Meet a bad little honey with a pretty face
I wanna slide out to Inglewood
Long Beach where it feels good
Compton where the hell you at
Show me love we be looking for the loud packs
Shout out to South Central, shout out to Watts
Where the killers always got my back
I wanna chill out in Fresno (Stockton)
I wanna go to San Diego

I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali",California,2015

Parole de Aur??lie:
[Refrain]
Aur??lie n'a que 16 ans et elle attend un enfant,
Ses amis et ses parents lui conseillent l'avortement,
Elle n'est pes d'accord elle voit les choses autrement,
Elle dit qu'elle se sent pr??te pour qu'on l'appelle ''maman''.
Celui-ci c'est pour toutes les aur??lies,
Celles qui ont donn??es la vie,
Pour toutes les Aur??lie,
Oy, m??re ?? tout pris

Elle est en seconde dans un lyc??e de banlieue,
Sort avec un mec de sont quartier depuis peu,
Il est comme elle l'aime c'est ?? dire un peu plus vieux,
Il a l'air amoureux, ils ont tout pour ??tre heureux...

Elle l'a jamais fait elle attendait juste le bon gas,
La elle se dit ''bingo'' il sont seul dans la twingo,
Donc ??a va swinguer, elle enl??ve son tanga, 
Et r??ussi le ace comme Tsonga

Oui mais voila 9 mois plus tard il assume pas et se sauve comme un b??tard,
Elle a d??couvert qu'en fait il est f??tard,
R??sultat elle se retrouve seule dans cette histoire.

Oy, m??re ?? tout pris

Je peux te dire que toute sa vie elle se rappellera,
Elle se rappellera le jour o?? elle annon??a,
O?? elle annon??a ?? sa m??re et son papa
Elle annon??a qu'elle ??tait enceinte de 3 mois,.
Elle ne s'attendais pas ?? ce qu'il saute de joie,
Mais elle esp??rait quand m??me qu'il fassent preuve de bonne fois,
Le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que se ne fut pas le cas,
Et la gal??re commen??a...

elle a du construire tr??s rapidement un foyer,
Faire face a ses responsabilit?? pour le loyer,
Trouver un travail co??te que co??te pour le payer,
Elle aura tout essayer...
Comme on dit dans les quartiers elle s'est saign??e,
Pour trouver quelqu'un qui veuille bien la renseigner,
Je crois qu'on n'est pas V.I.P comme Mathilde Seigner,
De ne pas l??cher l'affaire ??a lui a enseign??, ooh

On a tous connu une fille dans le cas d'Aur??lie,
Une pour qui grossesse est synonyme de d??lit,
Rejet??e par ses amis mais surtout sa famille,
Qui n'acceptent pas qu'elle souhaite donner la vie,
Voila ce que je dirais si je devais donner mon avis,
Mettre un enfant au monde ne devrais pas ??tre punis,
C'est la plus belle chose qui soit et si tu le nies,
C'est que tu n'a rien compris...

Colonel Reyel,"On s'était dit rendez-vous dans 10 ans 
Même jour, même heure, même pomme 
On verra quand on aura 30 ans 
Sur les marches de la place des grands hommes 

Le jour est venu et moi aussi 
Mais j' veux pas être le premier. 
Si on avait plus rien à se dire et si et si... 

Je fais des détours dans le quartier. 
C'est fou c'qu'un crépuscule de printemps 
Rappelle le même crépuscule d'y a 10 ans 
Trottoirs usés par les regards baissés. 
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fais de ces années ? 

J'ai pas flotté tranquille sur l'eau, 
Je n'ai pas nagé le vent dans le dos. 
Dernière ligne droite, la rue Souflot, 
Combien seront là 4, 3, 2, 1... 0 ? 

On s'était dit rendez-vous dans 10 ans 
Même jour, même heure, mêmes pommes 
On verra quand on aura 30 ans 
Sur les marches de la place des grands hommes 

J'avais eu si souvent envie d'elle. 
La belle Séverine me regardera-t-elle ? 
Eric voulait explorer le subconscient. 
Remonte-t-il à la surface de temps en temps ? 
J'ai un peu peur de traverser l' miroir. 
Si j'y allais pas... J' me serais trompé d'un soir. 
Devant une vitrine d'antiquités, 
J'imagine les retrouvailles de l'amitié. 
""T'as pas changé, qu'est-ce que tu deviens ? 
Tu t'es mariée, t'as trois gamins. 
T'as réussi, tu fais médecin ? 
Et toi Pascale, tu t' marres toujours pour rien ?"" 


On s'était dit rendez-vous dans 10 ans 
Même jour, même heure, mêmes pommes 
On verra quand on aura 30 ans 
Sur les marches de la place des grands hommes 

J'ai connu des marées hautes et des marées basses, 
Comme vous, comme vous, comme vous. 
J'ai rencontré des tempêtes et des bourrasques, 
Comme vous, comme vous, comme vous. 
Chaque amour morte à une nouvelle a fait place, 
Et vous, et vous...et vous ? 
Et toi Marco qui ambitionnait simplement d'être heureux dans la vie, 
As-tu réussi ton pari ? 
Et toi François, et toi Laurence, et toi Marion, 
Et toi Gégé...et toi Bruno, et toi Evelyne ? 

Et bah c'est formidable les copains ! 
On s'est tout dit, on s' sert la main ! 
On peut pas mettre 10 ans sur table 
Comme on étale ses lettres au Scrabble. 
Dans la vitrine je vois le reflet 

D'une lycéenne derrière moi. 
Elle part à gauche, je la suivrai. 
Si c'est à droite... Attendez-moi ! 
Attendez-moi ! Attendez-moi ! Attendez-moi ! 

On s'était dit rendez-vous dans 10 ans, 
Même jour, même heure, mêmes pommes 
On verra quand on aura 30 ans 
Si on est d'venus des grands hommes... 
Des grands hommes... des grands hommes...

ain't dope it's a musical treasure never come and test a, dope MC like
Brown and the C.O. check this. Lil El.

Crusin' down the street in my 64 
A brother stuck a strap in my window
So I grabbed the strap mashed on the gas
Had that brother running down the block like the Flash
Shouldn't of tried to stick Brown for his cash
Doing 65 on the shore that's his ass
I let him go the nigga screamed ""No""
He had a little heart though and bucked at my door 
As he rolled and rolled, I seen it all in my mirror of my 64
I even got proof buckshots in my door 
Where ever you go keep one eye open at all times
Cause you can get got or even get popped
From hood to hood it ain't all good
You better watch you back, where ever you at

On the east we got the guns, (on the west we got gats)
On the east we lick a shot, (on the west we peel your cap)
Only two bags of buddah, (to chronic sacks) 
Cause it ain't where you from it's where you at

Rollin' dice with plum gettin' high in the park
Strapped with ooh ops cause it's crazy after dark
Cause when shit gets sparked niggas feel the heat
From the city that never sleeps or skips a beat
On the streets your incomplete if your not ready for whatever
Cause niggas in the streets be ill and steady 
24-7 fuckin' days a week
Lights and great heights right in the concrete
Day time night time brawls in the heat
These are the things that happen in the street don't sleep
Murder rate crime constantly all the time
For every nigga gets ahead there's another one behind
Trying to get hip to the strive to get mine
Cause life's like a mountain an endless climb for this rhyme thing
Hood to hood shit's no good guard your grill killer

Nine to five hit me one time because I'm so damn high
I get kodiac lord of the chronic sack
Plus I've been a phat mack ever since way back
When it was 2 point 0 for the dove sack
Give me a phat track I'll give you phat raps
My verbal haze took over the west coast 
It's no secret who's herb you love the most
And now we be chillin' with the east coast villains
Exchanging methods on the way we gonna kill 'em
You get the guns and we'll get your back 
And you can bust shots and we'll peel the cap
From hood to hood it ain't all good you better watch you back nigga

Keep your head up Queens for the funds 
Coming no triple beam dream and them fiends ain't on my team
Got my strippin' for the cream so I lean
Gun free get the scene on the ski mask 
And action set set ready for blastin'
Stickinn' your crew in disorderly fashion 
Rashin' mean never son you're fuckin' with a clever one
Foe fiends listen more power then Tom Eddison
On the doo op I light the crowd like an ooh op
No witness to the rhyme vandel evidence is surcumstancial
And I still I grip a pistol by the handle
then start blowin' out niggas like 16 candles
He cold I smoke the fuckin' blunts to the roach
And we're quick to break why'all niggas if ya fell in your approach
Cause the gang bangers drug hangers and gun slangers
Just keep gettin' the money it's all good honey yeah yeah yeah

See sorry baby but I gotta do what I gotta
It ain't where you from it's where ya at

I'm just trying to survive doing everything I have to just to stay alive
I try to breath but the waters keep on choking me
I try to swim but my arms and legs are killing me
I'm just trying to survive doing everything I have to just to stay alive

[Chorus]
I just need sometime so I can breathe
Call it what you want to, still have to do this for me
I just need sometime so I can breath call it what you want to, still have to do this for me

I'm over it I'm over it
I'm giving up on you I'm over it I'm over it
I'm just trying to survive
But everything I do looks so hopeless on the outside
Things I said just to try to make sense
Things I didn't to protect me from the consequence
I'm just trying to survive doing everything I have to, to stay alive this time

You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you

I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you

This may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that

And I'm going to extremes

And today won't mean a thing

The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I love you more than anything 
I can't throw that away my love.

you understand the man that hides deep inside.
So come to me I need you dearly
I'll never give you reason to say goodbye

and times I wasn't there for you,
But for our love I'd even die 
by you I'm gonna stay

Has brought new meaning in my life
You give me so much happiness
Just to see you smile, gives me
The strength to go on
I cherish all the moments
We spend together, the laughter
The tears, they're all special to me
I guess what I'm really trying to say is that
I love you

For all the times we shared together
For all we've been through, Forever love

Let her dream, for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her

And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
And if allowed but one possession
I will pick her from the garden to be mine, mine

Be careful how you touch her, for she?ll awaken
And sleeps the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying, for a debt she never owes
And the silent wind still blows, that only she can hear, so she goes

I feel it all over when you're around.
Keep savin' that honey love,
'Cause your daddy's back in town, c'mon.
I want you now, mama, every day and night.
I want to make love to you till the morning light.
So just hold on, mama, don't you close the door.
I'll satisfy your wants, and you'll be beggin' me for more.
Suga, c'mon.

[Chorus]
I'm diggin' your freaky style, lets take it all the way.
Get kinky, baby, for a while, lets take it all the way.
Ain't nothin' like gettin' down, lets take it all the way.
We can kick it, mama, here and now,
Lets take it all the way.
Step to my game, 
Mama, show me where your from. 
'Cause I really don't want to stop, mama,
Till the morning comes.
We'll be making sweet love.
Lets do it all.
You feel just what I mean.
I'm givin' everything you want. 

[Chorus]

You know I gots the ah, I know you gots the oh.
Yo, all we need now is time for me and you.
It's a little crazy, you's a little wild. 
Put 'em both together and you got a freaky style...
Freaky style.
Yo, put 'em both together and you got a freaky style.

We could take this all the way.
Ooh-we-ooh, all the way.
Ah, let me take you all the way.
Ooh-we-ooh, all the way.
Girl, I see you been thinkin';
I been thinkin' that way too.
Oh, girl, you should know by now.
I would know just what to do, ah, girl.
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
So, come a little bit closer.
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
And let me kiss you right there.
Ah, oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
And we could listen to some Marvin Gaye.
And we could take this all the way.
[Chorus]
My love, let me take your hair down,
'Cause I've got one thing on my mind.
I just want to freak your body down low.
Sexin' you naked, by candlelight.
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
So come a little bit closer, baby.
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
You know it's time to get down.
Ah, oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
It never mattered what your friends might say.
We can take this all the way.
[Chorus]
I'll freak you on and on.
Turn you on, turn you out.
Baby, I'm anticipatin',
We could get away from everything.
All night we could scream and shout.
We'll just go as far as you want.
All the way.

Color Me Badd,"[Chorus]
The farmers daughter got a one track mind.
Give me some time to let me show you, baby.
Yo' daddy's in the house; he ain't lookin'.
I noticed you been peekin' at me, suga.
I wanna hit you, girl, behind the haystacks.
Ya finger lickin', like a funky chicken,
And I know ya like when I do that.
You can have my cars and my money,
'Cause all I need is what ya make me feel,
And I love ya.

[Chorus]
You and me; word to mom,
Still checkin' each other out, hey.
You and me, take ya to the sexiest places.
Still, we got time for a little... Watch your mouth.
Oh, my bad, hope ya will spend the night.
We can do things we never even tried, mmmmmm.
Oh, farmer's daughter,
Child, you know what I want.

[Chorus]
Apple, peaches, pumpkin pie.
That's the way you tasted inside, well,
Suga, tell me something good;
I would eat you if I could.
Saturday, we can freak in the woods,
And I'm gonna take you downtown on, say, Tuesday.
Oo, it good.
Alright now, express yourself.
Ah baby, alright.
