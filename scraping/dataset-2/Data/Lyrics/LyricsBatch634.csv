Baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of

Luis Russell & His Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1999

Folks won't pass me by
Dallas, Texas, that's the town

Going back to stay there 'til I die

Y esto fue lo que me dijo

Que vienes a buscar?
No quiero hablar contigo
Por que no te vas ya?
Por que no te vas ya?
Por el mismo camino

Que tiene ella que no tenga yo?
Que te da ella que no te doy yo?
Como te atiende que no lo haga yo?
Si toda mi vida yo te he dado amor

Se que me engañas con otra mujer
Aqui no hay nada todo se murio
Yo de segunda no la puedo hacer
Mejor se larga, vallase señor

Vete vete ya
Pa` donde la otra
Que ya no aguanto mas
La camisa pinta`
Ni mal abotona`

A todas horas, vete vete ya
Pa` donde la otra
Que si ella te da mas
Ya tiene libertad pa` hacer sus cosas

Que yo no me voy a morir
Eso fue lo ultimo que dijo
Oiga señor se puede ir
Que yo me quedo
Sola con mis hijos

Vete vete ya
Pa` donde la otra
Que si ella te da mas
Ya tienes libertad pa`
Hacer sus cosas

Sabe lo que me dijo?
No te de vagabundo

Ayy

Voy pa` ya
Con los poderes

Dejame hablarte negra porfavor
Por que me hechas a la calle asi?
Yo te he querido aunque digan que no
Y sin ti negra, no podre vivir

De apariensa no pue vivir
Ella me dijo ya no hay solucion
Y aunque me duela vallase de mi
Coja la ropa y vallase señor

Vete vete ya
Pa` donde la otra

Sueño con tus ojos
Y en silencio sin tu amor

Te llamo why no estás tú
Si no escucho tu voz

Why todo cambió, cambió, cambió
La puerta voló, voló, voló
Why ahí estabas tú

Why todo cambió, cambió, cambió

Why no sé lo que hacer
Me quiero divertir
Why no sé a dónde ir

Vuelve a comunicar
Necesito tu amor

Tito el bambino (oh)

Yo que vine buscándote a ti
Tu viniste a lo mismo
Porque conmigo te quieres ir
Y porque esperar ya vamonos de aquí
Que la noche es larga
Y lo que yo tengo es pa ti

Tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
Tu olor me mata cuando tenemos sexo
Tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
Tu olor me mata

Solo tu y yo sabemos que en un cuarto es totalmente distinto
Que en los momentos de pasion nos llenamos del instinto
Entre tu y yo guardamos un secreto que ante todos es prohibido
Pero tu eres mi tentación
Y contigo no soy prohibido

Tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
Tu olor me mata cuando tenemos sexo
Tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
Tu olor me mata

Se que estoy jugando con fuego
Pero hay algo adentro que quiero quemar
Quiero revolcarme en la almohada
Y las sabanas de nuestro amor quiero llenar
Quiero llenar la casa de todas mis fantasías
Haciéndolo en cualquier lugar
En lo oscuro nos sorprenda el día
Y uno de los dos no pueda mas

Seras tu, seré yo
Te aseguro de mi parte quiero continuar
Seras tu, seré yo
Te aseguro de mi parte quiero continuar

Yo que vine buscándote a ti
Tu viniste a lo mismo
Porque conmigo te quieres ir
Y porque esperar ya va monos de aquí
Que la noche es larga
Y lo que yo tengo es pa' ti

Tu olor me mata cuando tenemos sexo

Luiz Bonfá,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1959
Luiz Bonfá,"Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a gota 
De orvalho numa pétala de flor 
Brilha tranquila 
Depois de leve oscila 
E cai como uma lágrima de amor 
A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar 
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada 
É como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo, por favor 
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim",A  Felicidade,1959

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

O que você não quis desabafar
Chega de temor

Chorar
Sofrer
Sorrir
Se dar

E se perder
E se achar
E tudo aquilo que é viver
Eu quero é mais me abrir

Assim como se fosse o sol
Desvirginando a madrugada
Quero sentir a dor
Dessa manhã

Nascendo
Rompendo
Tomando
Rasgando meu corpo
E então eu

Chorando
Sofrendo

Adorando

Gritando feito louca alucinada
E criança
Eu quero meu amo

Se derramando

Gente é o lugar de se perguntar o um
Das estrelas se perguntarem se tantas são

Essa força que mora em seu coração

Gente pobre arrancando a vida com a mão
No coração da mata, gente quer prosseguir
Quer durar, quer crescer, gente quer luzir

It's been this way since time began

Don't go to the bridge of sorrow

When the world is as heavy as it is for you
There is no comfort by the light of the moon

But you can't escape the heart of the matter

Only fools rush in

Lies the heart and soul of man
Find a deep well to draw from
And give back as you can

And in the shadows
Where an old faith's sheltered

Footsteps, I could learn to listen
Footsteps, how I long to trace
Footsteps, I could learn to listen
To footsteps of an ancient race

Wells dry forever
The orchid starts to bleed

I love the ground whereon she goes
I wish the day it soon might come
When she and I might be as one

Luka Bloom,"On a day of days
I stood and gazed
Over the western sea
Startled and struck,
Frightened to look
When a mermaid called to me

Ooh-wah ooh-wah
Ooh-wah ooh-wah
My sunny sailor boy

Like a man in a dream,
For an age it seemed
I stood as still as a stone
While the mermaid sang
And her melody rang
Like a memory calling me home

Then the sea and the wind
And the shores did spin
Though my resistance was strong
All the stars in space
Filled the mermaid's face
She captured my will with her song

Somehow I spoke,
The enchantment broke
I rubbed my eyes open wide
Like a dream she was gone
What remained was a song
Borne on the ebbing tide

Ooh-wah ooh-wah
Ooh-wah ooh-wah

Luka Bloom,"When I look at you, I see your power
But when your blues come around
You're so hard on yourself
Somebody needs you
You always come through

You let nobody down
But when you're low
Where do you go?
Who helps you come around?

When I look at you
I see things you don't seem to
You're so hard on yourself
Don't be so hard on yourself
Somebody needs you
You always come through

You let nobody down
But when you're low

This beach is never the same
I don't find the rocky place
That was yesterday's revelation
So much yellow, silken hair
Left behind to bathe in
Here and now
I have to dream again

When the stars go in
At the break of morning
I get shaky under blue skies
It's just the way it is, sometimes
I lean against the harbour wall
Watch men working on the water
Here and now
I have to dream again

When the wind comes to my door
I'm all alone as I can be
And the ocean's mighty roar
Is all around me
They're playing horn pipes, jigs and reels
Just outside my window

As a place that just lies dead
Nothing to do for the body
Nothing to do for the head
Take me where the heather and the moss grows
The turf lies row after row
Out there in the sun to dry
I breathe it in as I pedal on by
With the kids and the dogs mucking together
Bringing in the turf
No matter what the weather

I'm a bogman
Deep down, it's where I come from ...

I'd love to see Arizona
Or the West Australian sands
But my heart belongs to those precious wetlands
No matter where your travelling takes you
Sure the bog will never leave you
Some people look for God above
Down in the bog I found love
Where the heather and the moss grows
The turf lies row after row
Out there in the sun to dry
I breathe it in as I pedal on by
With the kids and the dogs mucking together
Bringing in the turf
No matter what the weather

I'm a bogman
Deep down, it's where I come from ...

Think about it
You love a cuppa tea by the turf fire
Your arms around your heart's desire
The two of you looking out at the midland night
At the shooting stars and the satellites
Turf smell warms hearts

Every night is a full moon

Whenever you come into the room
Fresh wild smell of Jasmine

Alone I walk the hillside
Alone I pace the sand
Alone I think about you
Close my eyes and I kiss your hand
Alone I lick the rain
Streaming down upon your face
Alone I see the moment
We're together in a high place
Alone I sing your praises
Alone I have to let you know
Alone, you make the ripples
Honeywater afterglow
 
Rain comes pouring down
Pouring down

In the wind, the kiss of wisdom
In the mountain, silent touch
In the river, juices flow
To the rhythm that I need so much
Outside the roar of thunder
Streets drip wet in the rain
Inside honeywater lingers
Please God we'll meet again

In the bushes and the stones

Covers the rice fields
Down below a woman awakens

With bell and bowl she goes
People come to see the face
People come to feel the light
Of an Irish Girl

Everything in the world is new
Everybody I tell wants to know you
Soshin ... Soshin ...

She washes noodles by the open window
Wet and soft between her fingers
The air of spring blows on her face
And the moment is eternal
Maura sits in the dark womb-like stillness
She's thinking 'How can I die or cease to be?
I am eternal, I am Roshi!'

Everything in the world is new

Neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I

There is a ship, it sails on the sea
Out on the deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
And on that boat I'll sink or swim

I leaned my back up against that boat
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me

Oh love is gentle, and love is kind
Gay as a jewel, when first it's new
When love grows old, still it carries on
But it sometimes fades like the morning dew

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

Smoking big fat blunts, drive in movie night
They tried to get you down, but you refused to die
They tried to give you angel wings, but you refused to fly

You'd rather stay in hell, and take your time in jail
They're only punishing a soul that you will never sell
We both know that we owe nothing to each other

About the emptiness I felt when I sat alone
About the happiness I feel when I sing it loud
He should have heard the noise we made with the happy crowd
Did my grandaddy know he taught me what a poem was
How you can use a sentence or just a simple pause
What will I say when my kids ask me who my daddy was

Before twenty deep depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single blow
Before all our careers depended on a single show

After we see them on TV we really wanna meet them

Before a single heart was broken by a single show

Lukas Graham,"I'm losing my faith, though, I was never religious
Losing my patience while I pray for forgiveness
Washing my hands but the water is wasted
I tried a darker side and I liked how it tasted
I tried to stay away from the dead and the living
It's hard to find an end when you have no beginning
I'm burning in Hell, but I'm already in Heaven
I'm going to war and I've chosen my weapon

Will you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?
Bless my soul, when you know I'm a sinner
Hold my hand
Hold my hand

The night you were leaving, you gave me a mission
You opened my eyes and you showed me a vision
I'm paving my way to get out of this prison
A few wanna help and not a lot wanna listen
I'm walking alone, and I can need a companion
To show me the wisdom, give me more understanding
I scared 'em away, I'm always over-demanding
But I got a seed and it's in need of some planting

Will you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?
Bless my soul, even though I'm a sinner
Hold my hand
Hold my hand
Hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner
Bless my soul, even though I'm a sinner

Father, ever since you left, I'm missing all my roots
I can't see the bigger picture, I can't find the proof
We told so many lies in an attempt to tell the truth
We're given all the tools but we forgot their proper use
I remember all the promises when they were made
And I will take all of our secrets with me to the grave
I'm waiting for the judgement that shall fall upon my head
I hope someone is here to pray for me when I am dead

Will you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?

Will you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2005
Luke,"We have already in the past produced records

And produced considerable results

Entends-tu le cri dehors

Le chant des vaux-riens,des renégats
Et le sang qui prolifére
Qui donne son sein aux libertaires
Contre les rires et les renvois

Luke,"Je brise mes rêves mais je ne brise personne
À tout ce que l'on enterre
À ce qui flotte et puis s'envole
Je cours comme un homme

Tout juste monocorde
Après celles lasses d'aimer
Les ""belles quand même"" que l'on pardonne
Je cours comme un homme

Contre mes ports d'attache
Contre mes bris de rêves
Contre l'amour trop lâche quand d'autres traînent

À la foi si crasse
Quand c'est la mort qui opère
Au sourire qu'on arrache
Au silence que l'on paye

Je cours comme un homme

Peut-être qu'un jour sans efforts
Il sera si bon d'avoir su
Qu'être plus beau c'est d'être moins mort
La chair est faible et je le suis

Je mens comme un homme

Au fond de moi la sentinelle pour why briller sans exception

A-t-on le cri do coeur, la vérité ou la raison?
Vous n'entendez donc que la bête
Et ses réponses à vos questions

[Chorus:]
Est-ce que la fièvre est un délit d'opinion?
Est-ce que ma peine était un vote de sanction
La sentinelle qui trouve réponse à mes questions
Serait-ce la bête, serait-ce la bête, ou bien l'oppression?

Mon prix sert de silence aux fossoyeurs de compassion
Aux mijorés la suffisance, aux incendiaires de l'unisson
Quand un sourire décède d'avoir sourit à l'opinion
A cette soupape, cette sainte atèle, j'aurais pu encore dire non

[Chorus]

Serait-ce la bête, serait-ce la bête, ou bien l'oppression?
Serait-ce la bête, serait-ce la bête, ou bien l'oppression?

Ravale donc ta rengaine, ravale donc tes sanglots,
De l'amour ou d'la haine, qui donc aura bon dos?

Sous vos crachats ma rédition

Gay ass motherfuckers! Snoop ass  hoe ass  dog ass nigga! 
Dre  you ain't nothin' but my bitch  I'ma make you my bitch!

Keep tryin' to front, get your motherfuckin' back split 
And yo' ass kicked! Your shit is drastic! 
Run up on my nigga, get your punk ass blasted! 
Real niggas don't talk that gay shit 
Talk about, let another nigga suck ya dick 
Only punks talk like that 
I won't even bust ya; I'll slap you with my gat! 
Frontin' like a gangsta, but you's a faggot 
See if you can act it, but you can't back it 
A nigga like me won't play wit' ya 
I'ma buck buck buck when I get ya! 
Fuck it, I'm goin' all out 
Step on Death Row and spray up ya house, nigga! 
Dumb motherfucker tryin' to talk bad 
Fuck around, get a missile launched in yo' ass 
And for your homies talkin' fly shit, 
If we was locked up together I'd have made 'em MY bitches! 
'Cause I know y'all pranksters 
Y'all niggas still fakin' like gangsters! Fuck y'all!! 

It's about time for me to tear the roof off the motherfucker 
I grab the gat to make you fuck-niggas run for cover 
You can fool a groupie, but you can't fool a gangsta 
1985, you used to be a fuckin' prankster 
Down with (?) and the World Wreckin' Cru 
Turnin' off the lights and dressin' like bitches too 
Every nigga on Death Row must be a joke 
I put a level to the chair and watch you niggas smoke 
Real niggas don't follow punks down here 
I guess your nigga Snoopie Dogg must be a queer 
So who the fuck you gonna blast here in Miami? 
Fuck with me and I'll kill your whol' family! 
And I do mean hoe', you think I'm playin', son? 
I got my glock to your head, now where you gonna run? 
Before you diss my nigga Luke, you better think twice 
I'll pull a trigger, nigga, and turn off your life! 

Yeah, fuck-ass nigga, you just don't know! A nigga know about yo' 
Motherfuckin' ass with them ""Turn Off the Lights"" days! Nigga, 
When you was sittin' on them album covers with the motherfuckin' 
Lip gloss, and them sequins outfits on, nigga, I know what a nigga want 
You to do right now! Nigga, you know what I want you to do for me 
Right now? I want you to just, 
Take off that g-string, baby, 
'Cause you know you look real crazy, 
And you gon' be my hoe maybe

Fuck with my nigga and yo' ass'll get killed quick 
Pussy nigga, you ain't shit!! 
Did a whole album of other niggas pullin' your dick 
I'll wreck your whole staff 
Bust shots at they ass, you niggas can't last! 
So don't try to flip the script, money grip 
Got a tech on my hip, plus I'm in the mood to trip 
And I'll take your four-four 
Take a walk down Death Row, them niggas get Petrol 
'Cause that shit ain't nothin' but soft-town

Biggie bag bitches from barbecues to Barmitzvah's
The Big don't fit, use your lips 'cause
I'm feeling kinda itchy for a quicky
Don't take off your coat, all you got to do is lick me
Me eat you, I beat you, then greet you to the door,
Bitch, 'cause I don't love you no more
Which one of these hoes in the lobby want to slob me
You know me, I like my dick brown like Bobby
In the duke shoot, then the bitch get the boot
Unless you lick ass and blow dicks like flutes
I like'em cute, round tits and fat asses
Educated, so I can bust off on they glasses
I want to cum on your tongue and gums, all night
The bitch drink nuts by the pint

Always dressed up looking nice
Spending money on the latest styles
I guess she thinks it drives me wild
It don't take no fancy clothes to turn this cowboy on

[Chorus]
It could be
Blue jeans or mini skirt
A tank top or my old work shirt
It don't matter what she's wearing
Ohhh that girl she's got me staring
That dress looks good for sure
I like it better laying on the floor
From head to toe I love it all
Now take it off

She don't need to get all dolled up
Could care less about all that stuff
High heels
Fish nets
Don't mean a thing to this here redneck
But one thing I know for sure
Less is always more

I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in to deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

"Luke ""The Duke"" Smith","Believe that there will be a brighter day Situations tend to weigh us down
And its easy to let 'em steal your joy away its always when you are the closest
To almost getting through change seems far away

Everyday we live there's problems all around
Things you can't brace yourself for
And tomorrows another day
I know that it ain't easy
To smile and hide the pain
Oh, I've been there before
So I'm telling you

[Chorus]
When you've had enough you wanna give up
You gotta believe that there will be a brighter day
Seems you can't go on just stay strong you gotta just believe
That there will be a brighter day

There are time when you can't take no more seems like every door's locked
And can't be opened the doubts of dreams ever coming true can discourage you
But you need to see that

Everyday we live there's problems all around
Things you can't brace yourself for
I know that it ain't easy
To smile and hide the pain
Oh, I've been there before
So I'm telling you

[Chorus]

Goals are nearer, things are clever now you finally see
It's gonna make you wanna say
All my problems they've been solved and days look brighter to me

To the edge, go to the extreme

Did it hurt and did you cry?""

Through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me 
I thought God I'm a lucky man

Lug it down the bank with my arm draggin'

And watch him run to grandma, cryin' on the dock

Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking

Feel of your body takin' off your dress,
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess
So if I'da known, I'da held on
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose,
'Cause I still see you

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you, faded away

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you, faded away
You faded away",Faded Away,2011

There's tractor trailers backed up down by the elevators
Train track grain car'll roll in later

There's a thermos and a water jug
Rolling around in the cab

Wrapped up in a greasy red rag

The desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain

The way cool mountain waters dance down to the sea
Bound by something strong but still so wild and free
It gives into the passion of the path it takes
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire
That no one sees but burns all night long with desire
The quiet ease that makes a lover wanna stay

Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said ""I better go""
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was wakin' up my life
To what love was, I can still see us

Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that’s how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don’t quit 'til the job gets done

That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Don’t back up, don’t back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more

That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you don’t get nothing that you don’t earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
We didn’t know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn’t thinking ‘bout nothing but winning

Will get you there a little bit faster,

Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up.
We’d drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial.
One little country station was all there was.

Checking gates, fixing fence rows – that’s how my story goes.

If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary.
It’s right there for you to see, every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory.
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridin’ round, windows down on a summer night.
I was there, and that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.

I remember when I turned sixteen I got a license and some gasoline.
Ain't a curve or a straight away we didn’t fly down.
If wasn’t the boys it was me and her by fire in a field or down on the river.
Every inch of that county was sacred ground.

I wish I knew where that old truck was.
If it could talk it could tell on us.

I didn't know what to say.

I took a walk to clear my head,
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good lord knows
The reasons why it gets
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is

I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone

I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking led
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess

Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend
Until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to

Little something off the secret menu
Kick back, and let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so damn good on
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
I got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting

Luke Bryan,"Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard to a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to

Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

Luke Bryan,"You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says ""Hello""
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

You can't escape it if you wanted to, you don't
Know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait

Used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

Luke Bryan,"We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a two mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

I don't get back near enough
And just like these fields yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows

To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet

Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found

And let it shatter on the ground

Me and you got caught up in a little wild and young
Kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around
We can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then, girl
Close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it

Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

While I was burning off my credit card
She was burning tires out in the parking lot

Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round

And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song

We made this sun tan city yeah
All of y'all's, sing-a-long so loud
We took this beach town over

Come on

There's a little place down the old road
Nobody but me and the whole world knows

I do all my dreamin' there

Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When we join grandma, and the by and by
Got them right here in the dashboard box

And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told, boy, you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
You find that old guitar and write down another verse

More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell

Got a couple scars, I kinda ain't proud of

And if you're glass is half full, you better make damn sure it's whiskey

I come in at 5 a.m. 
And she is waiting for me
She said ""where have you been?""
I said I was out
She said ""you're no good 'cause you're running without love""

And hit the road""

We'll make it alone whether you like it or not

And I can't wait 'til he wakes up
And see the pictures on his phone

Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast

And I got wore out by my daddy for stealing cigarettes from the Smokes and More
When all my friends would get away, seems I'd get caught plane as day
I took the blame for every little thing

But I got away with you 
And somehow I still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth like I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz

I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels, and I got away with you

Let alone a fool like me, hand in hand with you should be doin' time

You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise

Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
And then when Thursday came around, I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waist of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station, won a four-day, three-night, beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how, lately now, it just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh lord, when it rains it pours

It was where granddaddy taught me how to cuss and how to pray
It was where we made our own ice cream those sultry summer nights
Where the bulldog had her puppies, and us brothers had our fights

There were many nights I'd sit right there and look out at the stars
To the sound of a distant whippoorwill or the hum of a passing car
It was where I first got up the nerve to steal me my first kiss
And it was where I learned to play guitar and pray I had the gift

With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

Luke Evans,"We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger's just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song

All positions came through, mean to rate it A to Z
Hanging from the shower rod, maybe we can skip that

Untouchable my clique is
Money long as my dick is

On the Banks of the Roses me love and I sat down
And I took out me fiddle for to play me love a tune
And in the middle of the tune-o she smiled and she said
Ere Johnny, lovely Johnny won't ya leave me

When I was a young one I heard me father say
That he'd rather see me dead and buried in the clay
Sooner than be married to any runaway
By the lovely sweet banks of the roses

And then I am no runaway and soon I'll let them know
That I can take a bottle or can leave it alone
And if her daddy doesn't like it he can keep his daughter at home
And young Johnny will go rovin' with some other

 And when I get married t'will be in the month of May
When the leaves they are green and the meadows they are gay
And me and me true love we'll sit and sport and play
By the lovely sweet banks of the roses

Luke Kelly,"Oh well, who wouldn`t be a sailor lad a sailin` on the main. 
To gain the good will of his captain`s good name? 
He came ashore one evening for to be. 
And that was the beginning of my own true love and me 

Chorus: 
And it`s home,boys,home 
Home I`d like to be home for a while 
In  me me own country, 
Where the oak and the ash and the bonny rowan tree 
Are all a-growin` green in the old country. 

Well I asked for a candle for to light me up to bed 
And likewise for a handkerchief to tie around me head. 
She tended to me needs like a young maid ought to do, 
So then I says to her ”Now won`t you leap in with me too?” 

Well she jumped into bed, making no alarm 
Thinking a young sailor lad could do to her no harm. 
Well I hugged her and I kissed her the whole night long, 
Till she wished the short night had been seven years long. 

Well early next morning the sailor lad arose 
And into Mary`s apron threw a handful of gold 
Saying ”Take this me dear for the mischief that I`ve done 
For tonight I fear I`ve left you with a daughter or a son.” 

”Well if it be a girl child, send her out to nurse, 
with gold in her pocket and with silver in her purse, 
and if it be a boy child he`ll wear the jacket blue 
and go climbing up the rigging like his daddy used to do” 

Oh come all of you fair maidens, a warning take by me, 
Never let a sailor lad an inch above your knee, 
For I trusted one and he beguiled me, 
He left me with a pair of twins to dangle on me knee

To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

[Chorus]

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears

And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday

I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place

I know you're smiling down on me

Luke Kelly,"BOULAVOGUE
(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

Luke Kelly,"I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
I wish I was a youth again
But a youth again I can never be
Till apples grow on an ivy tree 

I left me father, I left me mother
I left all my sisters and brothers too
I left all my friends and me own religion
I left them all for to follow you 

 But the sweetest apple is the soonest rotten
And the hottest love is the soonest cold
And what can't be cured love has to be endured love
And now I am bound for America 

Oh love is pleasin' and love is teasin'
And love is a pleasure when first it's new
But as it grows older sure the love grows colder
And it fades away like the morning dew 

And love and porter makes a young man older
And love and whiskey makes him old and grey
And what can't be cured love has to be endured love
And now I am bound for America

",Love Is Pleasing,1964
Luke Kelly,"As I went a walking one morning in May
I met a young couple so far did we stray
And one was a young maid so sweet and so fair
And the other was a soldier and a brave grenadier

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

Out of his knapsack he took a fine fiddle
He played her such merry tunes that you ever did hear
He played her such merry tunes that the valley did ring
And softly cried the fair maid as the nightingale sings

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

Oh, I'm off to India for seven long years
Drinking wines and strong whiskies instead of strong beer
And if ever I return again 'twill be in the spring
And we'll both sit down together love to hear the nightingale sing

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

""Well then"", says the fair maid, ""Will you marry me?""
""Oh no"", says the soldier, ""however can that be?""
For I've my own wife at home in my own country
And she is the finest little maid that you ever did see

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

But give me enough of the rare old stuff that's brewed near Galway Bay
Come policemen all from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim too
Oh, we'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip
Of the rare old Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still
Where the smoke curls up to the sky
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there's poitin' brewin' nearby

For it fills the air with a perfume rare
And betwixt both me and you
As home we stroll, we can take a bowl
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh
Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

Now learned men who use the pen
Have sung the praises high
Of the rare poitin' from Ireland green
Distilled from wheat and rye

Put away with your pills, it'll cure all ills
Be ye Pagan, Christian or Jew
So take off your coat and grease your throat
With the dear old Mountain Dew

Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind

Shining steel tempered in the fire

Where falcons build their nests
Silver winged they fly
They know the call of freedom in their breasts
Saw Black Head against the sky
Where twisted rocks they run down to the sea
Living on your western shore
Saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea
And sang a song for Ireland

Drinking all the day in old pubs
Where fiddlers love to play
Someone touched the bow
He played a reel
It seemed so fine and gay
Stood on Dingle beach
And cast in wild foam we found Atlantic bass
Living on your western shore
Saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea
And sang a song for Ireland
 
Talking all the day with true friends
Who try to make you stay
Telling jokes and news
Singing songs to pass the night away
Watched the Galway salmon run
Like silver dancing darting in the sun
Living on your western shore
Saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea
And sang a song for Ireland

Where no man had to fight
Waking in your dawn

Luke Kelly,"I remember the night that he came in from the wintery
Cold and damp
A giant of a man in an oilskin coat, and a bundle that
Told he was a tramp
He stood at the bar and he called a pint, then turned
And gazed at the fire
On a night like this, to be save and dry is my one and
Only desire

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Then in a voice that was hushed and low he said
""Listen, I'll tell you a tale""
How a man of the sea became a man of the road and never
More will set sail
I fished out of Howth and Killybegs, Ardglass and
Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on
The shore

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

One fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail
From Killybegs town
There were five of us from sweet Donegal and one from
County Down
We were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted
The cost
But I never thought 'ere that night was done, that my
Fine friends would all be lost

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown

But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'

And oh, how the wild winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and withstood several blasts
And we called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
And a chap called McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from West Meade called Malone

There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Casey from Dover
There was Dooley from Claire who was strong as a bear
And was skipper of the Irish Rover

We had one million bales of old billy goats' tails
We had two million buckets of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
We had four million packets of bones

We had five million hogs, we had six million dogs
And seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bags of the best Sligo rags
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced unto two

And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced for the scribe
And the pharisee,
But they would not dance 
And they wouldn't follow me.
I danced for the fishermen,
For James and John 
They came with me
And the Dance went on.


Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced on the Sabbath
And I cured the lame;
The holy people
Said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped
And they hung me on high,
And they left me there
On a Cross to die.

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced on a Friday
When the sky turned black 
It's hard to dance
With the devil on your back.
They buried my body
And they thought I'd gone,
But I am the Dance,
And I still go on.

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

They cut me down
And I leapt up high;
I am the life
That'll never, never die;
I'll live in you
If you'll live in me -
I am the Lord
Of the Dance, said he.",Lord of the Dance,1999

Alive as you and me
Says I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead'

Him standing by my side
'They framed you on a murder charge'
Says Joe, 'I never died'
Says Joe, 'I never died.'

The copper bosses they shot you, Joe, 
They filled you full of lead
'Takes more than guns to kill a man'
Says Joe, 'And I ain't dead'
Says Joe, 'And I ain't dead.'

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes
Says Joe, 'What they forgot to kill'

'Went on to organize'
'Went on to organize.'

Joe Hill ain't dead, he says to me
Joe Hill ain't never died

Joe Hill is at their side

In every mine and mill
Where working men defend their rights

Luke Kelly,"In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia, 
Down in the dark of the Cumberland Mine, 
There's blood on the coal, 
And the miners lie, 
In roads that never saw sun or sky, 
Roads that never saw sun or sky

In the town of Springhill you don't sleep easy, 
Often the earth will tremble and roll, 
When the earth is restless miners die, 
Bone and blood is the price of coal, 
Bone and blood is the price of coal.

In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia, 
Late in the year of '58, 
The day still comes and the sun still shines, 
But it's dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine, 
Dark as the grave in the Cumberland Mine.
 
Three days past when the lamps gave out, 
And Kaela Brushton got up and said, 
""We've no more water or light or bread, 
So we'll live on songs and hope instead, 
Live on songs and hope instead.""

Listen for the shouts of the black face miners, 
Listen through the rubble for the rescue teams, 
Three hundred tonnes of coal and slag, 
Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam, 
Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam.

Twelve days past and some were rescued, 
Leaving the dead to lie alone, 
Through all their live they dug a grave,

Luke Kelly,"While in the merry month of May from me home I started
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah 

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah 

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah 

From there I got away, me spirits never falling
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah 

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

Luke Kelly,"On Raglan Road of an autumn day
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I might one day rue

I saw the danger and I passed
Along the enchanted way
And I said, let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day

On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passions pledged

The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh, I loved too much and by such, by such
Is happiness thrown away

I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone

And her words and tint without stint
I gave her poems to say
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly
My reason must allow

That I had loved not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay
He'll lose his wings at dawn of day",Raglan Road,2006
Luke Kelly,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

We all show signs of greatness that we hope that someone sees
Our broken teeth are scattered but we're smiling underneath
A thousand bruising muscles still we're running on and on
We all know names that ring like thunder rattling our walls
Everyone is yearning for a reason for a cause
Somewhere deep inside we're hold on for dear life

Luke Stricklin,"My bills are paid, I've got some money saved
But It's been a week since I've seen my baby's face
Too much caffeine, and nicotine
Need a double shot of whiskey just to get to sleep
I can't complain, I just need to find a way
To break this chain of 12 hour days

I've worked down here, going on 10 years
But it's hard for me to call it a career
'cause it's hour by hour, and check to check
Everyday I have to earn the man's respect
I've heard him say there's lines of guys to take my place
Up on this string of 12 hour days

Chorus:
I can't slow down, I can't fall behind
Last thing I need is a place in the unemployment line

I've got needs, and I've still got dreams
But it's family that means the most to me
So I do my job, and when I can I rest
And I'll do better with what little time is left
I should give thanks, and be proud of the life I've made
So tonight I pray for more 12 hour days

Them long 12 hour days

Luke Stricklin,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

And the love lightened glow on your face
It's cold here in Iceland

And I think of your feel and my mind starts a spinning with all those possible things.

Sometimes mine is heavy to pull up this hill but I'll sit and think just the same

But unless you've made no mistakes in your life be careful of stones that you throw

A neighbor was passing my garden one time she stopped and I knew right away
That it was gossip not flowers she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say
That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to me or my child my neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse

A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes a sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still

Luke the Drifter,"Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

Luke the Drifter,"I went to the country just the other day
To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say

My wife's been sick, the young ones, too
And I'm darn near down with the flu
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The bees got mad and they left the hive
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The porch rotted down that's more expense
The darned old mule he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and I can't pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

My land's so poor so hard and yeller
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller
And it rains out here nearly every day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The house it leaks it needs a new top
When it rains it wets everything we got
The chimney fell down just yesterday
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The corn meals gone and the meat's run out
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke
And all we got left is one old Billy goat
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

My crop it rotted in the ground
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down
But we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days

Luke the Drifter,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew

Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips

Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race

And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above

The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan

Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground

And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long

And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray
",The Funeral,1998
Luke the Drifter,"A little girl prayed at the close of the day,
Cause her daddy had gone far away,
On her little face was a look of despair,
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
My Mommie says daddy has brought us to shame
And I'm never no more to mention his name
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly father help me understand

You know friends I wonder
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said

I'd like to tell you a story
Of a family I once knew.
We'll call them Mary and William
And their little daughter sue

Now Mary was just a plain mother
And bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
(Like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad

Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce

Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense

You know she didn't ask to be brought to
This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most

There'd be a lot more honest loving
In this wicked ole world today
If just a few parted parents
Could hear little sue say

Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly father, help me understand",Help Me Understand,1998
Luke the Drifter,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true
I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night

She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key

For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight

She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then

And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went to sleep

Usually gets just what he deserves

For a living death is all that's left for men with brokens hearts. 
You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn. 
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him.

And to those who weep death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts. 

Humble you should be when they come passing by, 
For its written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry. 
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts, 
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts. 
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes, 
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies. 

Some were porpers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts, 
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts.

Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead

Can't keep control can't keep track of where it's traveling
I got my heart but my heart's no good
You're the only one that's understood

I come along but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go but you're wrenching, dragging, shaking me
Turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky
The more I give to you the more I die
And I want you

You are the perfect drug
You make me hard when I'm all soft inside 
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed
The arrow goes straight through my heart 
Without you everything just falls apart
My blood just wants to say hello to you
My soul is so afraid to realize 
How very little there is left of me
And I want you

You are the perfect drug
(Take me with you)
Without you everything just falls apart
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces",The Perfect Drug [Plug],1997
Lukie D,"Sorry I never told you 
All I wanted to say 
Now it's too late to hold you 
'Cause you've flown away 
So far away 

Never had I imagined 
Living without your smile 
Feeling and knowing you hear me 
It keeps me alive 
Alive 

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
One sweet day 

Darling I never showed you 
Assumed you'd always be there 
I, I took your presence for granted 
But I always cared 
And I miss the love we shared 

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same 
I'll always look to a brighter day 

Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep 
You will always listen as I pray 

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven 
Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven

All I wanted to say",One Sweet Day,1996
Lukie D,"Love be still, love be sweet
Don't you dare change a thing
I want to photograph you with my mind
To feel how I feel now, all the time

Say that you'll stay forever this way
Forever and forever that we'll never have to change
Don't move, don't breathe
Don't change, don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
Oh, we'll stay this Way

I get afraid
I don't think ahead
Let's just stay this way in bed
Feels so good inside your arms
Home is everywhere that you are

Say that you'll stay forever this way
Forever and forever that we'll never have to change
Don't move, don't breathe
Don't change, don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
Oh, we'll stay this Way

Don't move don't breathe
Don't change don't leave
Promise me we'll always be

It's good to me
Promise me we'll always be

Lukie D,"Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Is there a way I could make you understand?

But how
Do you expect me, to live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there

Luli Y Sus Rappers,"I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test
I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends
Are gonna try to move your feet

See I am Wonder Mike and I like to say hello
To the black, to the white,
The red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well so far you've heard my voice
But I brought two friends along
And next on the mike is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here and I'm there
I'm big bang Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop
Why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel, motel what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl
Gonna get some spank drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel Holiday Inn
You say if your girl starts actin' up
Then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee
So he could shock the house


I said m-a-s, t-e-are, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the master gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there could ever be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And the damn ya start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MC's for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I dot a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a
Pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what ya got

And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on

Ill put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said one, two, three, four, come on girls get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all a-gimme what ya got

Tell me Wonder Mike what are you waitin for?

To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old

But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, its so unique

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
Rock it out baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait til the end of the week
When I'm rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight

So he could shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party ya got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you the groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin ya start to dream
And thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doin a do
Rockin ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of wonder mike
Come on wonder mike do what ya like
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like dracula with out his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin' that you're full and then
Your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin'
Your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate
And your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie

Lullaby Players,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road

Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in

But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'

The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?

Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night
Jumped out of bed, turned on the light
Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light

Let's get together and go for a walk in the park
And while we're walking we can steal a little kiss in the dark
I wanna walk with you (I wanna walk with you)
I wanna talk with you (I wanna talk with you)
But it's up to you to say ""Come on baby""
If you don't hurry up I'll go crazy
'Cause a walk in the park all alone is just no fun

CHORUS:
What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one

I'm sure that you know that I love you with all of my heart
But a love that's true really takes two to start
I wanna do my share (I wanna do my share)
To show you that I care (to show you that I care)
'Cause a one-sided love will never do
You gotta show me that you love me too
'Cause falling in love all alone is just no fun

Two can build a love affair fast
One can make a love get started
Two can make it last

Love can be cruel
It can smile like an angel
While it treats you just like a fool
it captures and haunts you
Until you give in
And it stats the dice against you
in a game you never can win
Just when I was thinking
Maybe luck was here with me
You're telling me it's over
Say it's time for breaking free

We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die

Lulu Santos,"They don't know 
What I know about 
Whatever they know 
So they're trying to figure out 
Whatever I know 
I'll tell you 

I'm just riding a high 
I'm just moving ahead in time 
And it's fine 

Sure, the feeling is fine

Where do I hang out

Lulu Santos,"Primeiro era vertigem
Como em qualquer paixão
Era só fechar os olhos
E deixar o corpo ir
No ritmo

Depois era um ví­cio
Uma intoxicação
Me corroendo as veias
Me arrasando pelo chão

Mas sempre tinha a cama pronta
E rango no fogão
Luz acesa, me espera no portão
Pra você ver
Que eu to voltando pra casa
Vê
Que eu to voltando pra casa
Outra vez

És vezes é tormenta
Fosse uma navegação
Pode ser que o barco vire
Também pode ser que não

Já dei Meia-volta ao mundo
Levitando de tesão
Tanto gozo e sussurro
Já impressos no colchão

Pois sempre tem a cama pronta
E rango no fogão
Luz acesa, me espera no portão
Pra você ver
Que eu to voltando pra casa
Outra vez

Primeiro era vertigem
Como em qualquer paixão
Logo mais era um ví­cio
Me arrasando pelo chão
Pode ser que o barco vire
Também pode ser que não
Já dei meia-volta ao mundo
Levitando de tesão",Casa,1990
Lulu Santos,"Na selva, a lei 
Dos homens não faz rei 
Brinda comigo 
A entrada da manhã

Nessa vida, ralei 
Caí e não quebrei 
Fiz um abrigo 
Com a tua própria lã

Com a boca, provei 
O mundo e não errei 
Traz no teu bico 
O doce gosto da maçã

Não tem pecado 
A vida é pagã 
Então me abraça 
Até tocarem o tan-tan

Clareira luminosa
Nessa escuridão
Bela como a luz da lua
Estrela do oriente
Nesses mares do sul
Clareira azul no céu
Na paisagem
Será magia, miragem, milagre
Será mistério

Prateando horizontes
Brilham rios, fontes
Numa cascata de luz
No espelho dessas águas
Vejo a face luminosa do amor
As ondas vão e vem

E vão e são como o tempo
Luz do divinal querer
Seria uma sereia ou seria só
Delí­rio tropical, fantasia
Ou será um sonho de criança
Sob o sol da manhão",Sereia,1995
Lulu Santos,"Já não tenho dedos pra contar
De quantos barrancos despenquei
E quantas pedras me atiraram
Ou quantas atirei
Tanta farpa, tanta mentira
Tanta falta do que dizer
Nem sempre é ""so easy"" se viver

Hoje eu não consigo mais me lembrar
De quantas janelas me atirei
E quanto rastro de incompreensão
Eu já deixei
Tantos bons quanto maus motivos
Tantas vezes desilusão
Quase nunca a vida é um balão

Mas o teu amor me cura
De uma loucura qualquer
É encostar no seu peito
E se isso for algum defeito
Por mim tudo bem
Tudo bem

Então é assim que a vida faz?
E sempre haverá um fim
Um pano rápido ou um plano
Longínquo do horizonte e os créditos

Os personagens se revelam
Atores no aplauso final
E pra cada interpretação
O que lhe for proporcional

Só vamo então deixar combinado

Lulu Santos,"Onde esta você
É o que eu quero saber
Como se me descobrir
Só dependesse de lhe conhecer

E ainda que não saiba quem é
Lhe vejo andando pela cidade
Desejo é o seu disfarce
Só desconheço o nome e a identidade

Cadê você

Eu quero rir
Quero sair e me divertir
Talvez se eu relaxar
Alguma coisa venha a surgir

O medo é que você ao entrar
Me encontre ali sonhando acordado
Quem sabe o que pode acontecer
É impossível que tudo de sempre errado

Então você pode me aparecer
Fecho os olhos para melhor lhe ver

Não vê não
Não houve nada
Só o passado rondando
Minha porta
Feito alma penada   

Você vive me dizendo
Que o pecado mora ao lado
Por favor não entra nessa
Que porque um dia
Ainda te explico direito
Eu sei, eu sei
Que esse caso tá meio
Mal contado
Mas você pode ter certeza
Nosso amor
É quase sempre perfeito   

Porque eu só faço com você

Lulu Santos,"A caravana cruzando o deserto
Brilhando ao sol do Oriente Médio
Pelas areias escaldantes desse branco mar
Escuros beduínos são guerreiros mouros de sangue e paixão

Medo e mistério das trilhas no oásis do amor
A noite cai no deserto e nas tendas
A luz do fogo ilumina os corpos
De belas nuas dançarinas, são vulcões de mel
Perfume de aventura inundando o ar de emoção e calor

Luxo e luxúria nas noites do oásis do amor
A caravana do delírio se perdeu de mim
Sozinho no deserto me senti feliz e cantei para o céu
Em plena miragem da luz no meio do dia

",Areias Escaldantes,1996
