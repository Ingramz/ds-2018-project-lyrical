Project Born,"I see P the wicked clowns and Project Born
Serial Slaughtering mutha fuckas in the graveyard

Tick to the mutha fuckin' tock
Nigga the click from Project Born and ICP are here to rock
Nigga trippen in the graveyard
Just don't try to play hard
It will be your ass up on the block
Up on the block when I start pullin' cards
'cause J will be the Barrier
2 Dope will be the Carrier
And Project Born is Sworn to put a bullet in your derriere
It's time to wake the dead and dead and move
And then they woke up a lot of souls
And hope to hell with the Nitty folk
'cause I be dreamin I'm dead and gone
And on the fuckin' tooth I miss
Mr. Nitty 74 to 94 took two to the head 
Tryin to be hard to get you there
And I'll be able to put you there
Punk ass nigga do your hair six mutha fuckas will carry you there
It'll side your fate, if I'm movin I be hurtin ya
I'm puttin on way to much drinks so it is curtains for ya
Bitches I'm a blast and the bitches are never after
These punk ass thinks he's tryin to throw the casket
on the masta, I'm fasta
You should of tried to beat me to the ticker yo
I don't give a fuck if Mr. Nitty bein hoe
Don't risk your neck from the brother on the bullevard
G-are-a-v-e-why-a-are-d bitch it's the graveyard

Stop into the graveyard been chillen here for days
Workin the graveyard shift diggen up all the graves
Sellin all the stiff to the Dead Body Man
Wakin back to life so then I began to ran
The decrepit mutha fucka was followin right behind
I don't know what to do, I think I'm losin my mind
Right then the corpse came jumpin out a tree
Way out a tree
And fallin on top of me
Back on my feet
As I began my face
Put my hands around his neck and tried to put it in a brace
But a nope, that's not how the shit goes
His head popped off and started nibblin on my toes
I got dead bodies to the right
I got dead bodies to the left
I thought the cary one, but what about the rest?
Tie me up with some veins dragen me into the tomb
I knew I had to be doomed
'cause I can hear the loons in my head
It was dead, echoin through my brain
Tellin me somthin's wrong then I felt the pain
It was nockin down my flesh by the pound
But that's what happens 
when you be fuckin around in the graveyard, dawg

Come to the graveyard now you see what's goin on
You scarder then a mother fucker shouldn't of brought
your ass along
Ain't no place to hide, and really no place to run
And plus I pack a bible, a shovel, and a shot gun
Don't you point your finger though ICP don't ride a hearse
You think it's over now, but now it's gonna get much worse
Deadly sour paid a gang, nothing else can fuck with that
See you want to don't know what you got, 
you better duck with that
The dead will come alive and decapitate your fuckin head
Now I gotta wake the dead
Sleepin on the death bed
Mr. Nitty gonna great the bitch, to you ain't no fuckin bitch
I'm stealin for the broken hoe
Suck on my dick you rich hoe
Your daddy got a job and he treat me like a bum
But I'm a let his ass know, he can come and get some
And he ain't mean shit to me
Commin from the PJP 
The Project Born assassin but you best be watchin me
'cause I'm diggin graves, graves is what I'm diggin
I can't believe this shit, this niggas still liven
So why you gonna play hard?
Brother blow your hole card
And I'll go slap your ass with the shovel in the graveyard

My name is Violent J and I be sleeping in a coffin
Deep underground
Never to be found
Then my body rots as I'm sleepin in peace
'cause nobody dares to ever wake the deceist
But who is this mutha fucka nocken at my tomb?
Disturbing the worms that are trying to consume, my body
It better be somebody worthy, bastard, 
oh, he he, it's the Ringmaster
Giving me orders to awake from the dead
My body is decade I need to find a new head
And a new leg, but then I'll be straight
To crawl from the dirt
And put in some work
One O'clock one thirty, two in the morning
Wicked Clowns ICP and Project Borning
At the graveyard I got the whole wide world in my hands
'cause I'm the Dead Body Man
Wicked, Wicked Jokers, Wicked Jokers, Wicked Fun
Eiffel eye and T and Southwest become one
And in the name of the dead you got delt yet another joker card
Straight from the graveyard (repeat)",Graveyard,1998

Project G-7,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Project Hate MCMXCIX,"On a drive I'm taking backroads
High against where the rivers are flowing
I didn't think that our love had grown

You had me dead to rights
Hey, I'm trying to get some rest 
To keep on moving

How you been, you looking back
You tried to change your burning boat
Until you realized what you were up against

I spent all those nights
Just trying to take you home
'Til you released me

Cross the bridge
To redefine your pain
The the answer is in your heart

Wide awake
I rearrange the way I listen in the dark
Dreaming of starting up again

So if you look, you'll find yourself
You're not the demon in the dark
That you and I, yea we'd been through that

Can you rectify
All the time it took you
Away from choosing?

So as you find yourself flying high up there
When you release me from your heart again (woo!)
I'm just a burning man trying to keep the ship
From turning over again
Cross the rich derivative of pain
Crush the burning in your heart
Wide awake
To redefine the way you listen in the dark
Dreaming, starting
Like a stranded kid in a doorway
Just burning

Soulless You now return

Project Kate,"I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,
So help me GOD
I just felt like telling the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone
Come on

Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'
I want to live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me standing on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?
(I'm feeling you)

[Chorus]

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screaming I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

My head was spinning, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'

Catch you slipping out here though, my dog, we knock your melon off
They cannot stunt, shoot them rifles long like African
Got them young boys shooting shit up like Africans

Lamborghini or Ferrari, watch these bitches come
Stacking funds off the drugs, me go quick to rob the plug
Nigga mouth was full of slugs, left these bodies full of slugs
Met me on the south side of the city with a whole thing
Iced 'em with the heater, took his shit, it's a cold game
His niggas know I done it, now it's rumors they want my head
Got my Russian bitch sleeping with me right in the bed

Project Pat,"[Chorus]
If you had a choice of colors 
which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which one you perfer to be right

[Verse 1]
Another day means another way
I can get some pay guys are gray
but the turning blue for a player true
to the game all aboard the train
those who kept it real couldn't hang I'm a holler man
this one you feel well I feel choices I made
ways to get paid if I lay down on my back
then I won't get jacked Project Pat
never fake the deal all about a meal 
keep a strap for the wolf pack out here trying to steal
cause I still think some of y'all 
want to see my fall but I ball that's in any weather 
can we stick together all is one but I know its some
always want to preach that I'm wrong 
cause I rap a song lyrically I reach
to the youth and I'm getting paid and I'm out the slum
legally ghetto fabulous player give me some
count my props cause I never stop trying to get laid
feeling good stacking dollar bills choices I made

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Here I go with a steady flow finally it last
on the bricks not behind bars come back in the past
had no cash and I had no car so i had to do anything 
just to maintain sipping on the brew not a fool
keeping hazards down to a minimum staying cool
down with my hood Memphis Hollywood understood
everybody can't play the same role
make a choice do it legally or you slang dope
but I hope that the choice made is the one for you
have a clue gotta know yourself 
hustle to your death making wealth
with a pad and pen walking out the pin
making steps to be right on top of my game again
 see my friend you the master of your destiny it can be
what you want it to man it's all on you player who
want to blow a dub ease on the brain
ain't no pain just a lot of love curving through your vain

Get her drunk, take her to the back, put dick in her mouth
Leave the front door unlocked, my nig turn the radio
Pull the car up into the yard, cleaning out the hoe

Get the cheese off the merchandise, went a bought a deal

Project Pat,"Yeah, you muthafuckin' hoes

Before you talk some old muthafuckin' shit
Bitch, it's whatever nigga, we in this muthafucka
For the 9-9, 9's to your head ho
(Mafia, mafia, mafi-ya, ya, mafia, mafia, mafi-ya, ya)

Glock 9's, Tech 9's, any kinda gun bitch
Evergreen gats have got these cowards on the run bitch
Kill 'em like they convicts
Know they hear them guns click

Doped up like a muthafucka
(Cough, cough, snort)
You could catch me in the same hood, on the fuckin' same block
With a pearl Rolex watch and a knot, and a glock
9 o'clock clock nigga like to slang 'cause I be hustlin' weight
And we gon' put a end to you hoes and you niggaz hatin'

I'ma be every fuckin' piece of skrilla cheese out here I can make
I'ma break every fuckin' bitch, fatalities that I can bring
I'ma millie my pillie but killie, killin' everything that I wanna kill
You weak ass niggaz don't want Lord Infamous
From South Parkway to get ill

Long from the norm, we get dumb with a bomb
With the guns you bitches y'all best get steel
Scarecrow, Club House, yes it gets ill
So, all y'all listen closely don't you ever forget
Y'all wouldn't, y'all never be shit with out us bitch, don't forget

Killin' ain't shit, bitches ain't shit
Niggaz ain't shit, bodies in a ditch
How any niggaz gonna talk dat shit
About da Cruchy fuckin' Black, Thug Posse ya bitch

Niggaz gon' talk, bitches gon' start
Muthafuckaz gonna get they bodies in a trunk
All I want is cash muthafuckaz have
Get down on your knees, gimme all your cash

Whoa, muthafucka watch yourself, just watch your back
'Cause still we chillin' with Pat, straped with them gats
Be ready to attack, all you hatin' ass niggaz
That wanna jump, yo punk what's up
You better come up real with your muthatfuckin' shit
'Cause boy, it's gonna get rough

Situation's gone bad for you niggaz claimin' killaz
Automatic triggaz pullin', drillin' holes inside your liver
How you figure, I was gon' let you talk that shit
And peep these streets sayin', ""That ScanMan boy's a bitch""
Know watch them throw lights out in my head

Killin', buckin', buckin' up in gunfire
Bullets rickin' off the walls, nigga this is warfare
Suckaz claimin' they got nuts
You don't know these elephants
Specialize in takin' notes, specialize in nappy hoes

Niggaz this is serious, I can't play no games no more
Niggaz actin' curious but I think they know the score
Bitches know the Hypnotize medallion show what click you claim
Hold it up strong, only those, who stay real, or maintain' in this game

a lot of niggaz talk that shit and end up gettin' the wig split
It's MC Mack, the nigga known for smackin', jackin', Cracker Jacks
Busta ass nigga, run you mouth and get your ass blowed off
Watch me put my ski mask on

Come a gat back now trick now drop it off
Shoot a super soaker in a minute
Don't you give a fuck about another nigga
If he's speakin' use your counter attack

Rollin' like a nigga smack a nigga like a nigga
Smack a bitch, you crump, you ain't no busta
Ain't no love lost off in my heart, there's no place colder
Won't you come a little closer nigga, you won't be rollin' our

Socialists up actin' miss servin' sevens
Have 'em in jail suspended, in the middle
Started rivalries civil, homies swithin', actin' fickle
But if you fuck with family ties, we leave you triple

That nigga there know his gun a missile
Lord don't flash on him, only man ain't chival
Erasin' ample businesses all in the name of the T-Rock
Suckaz eat pot, swallow D, and get punished for three rocks
Bangin' the hit stops, it won't be over, 'til your heat pops
Away from the gravity, stand and point your a tech and see him drop

Yeah, I know, I know, down, down, baby goin' down, down
Sweet dreams baby, rock-a-bye, baby
Niggaz wanna run up, we be flexin' the Tech
And be pointed at ya we comin', and I bitch, I bet ya, I bet ya

You wanna hit 'em but nigga you an't forget 'em, forget 'em
Because you sorry and sorry ain't nothin' but venom
I know bitches out there lovin' me, niggaz got dreams of fuckin' me
Fuckin' me ain't the story gon' fuck you up more than me

Ridin' in your hood and let the muthafuckin' bullets toss
Tossin' me a berries pack, now I'm tossin' you some dramma
Ridin' with my congregation and we smokin' on marijuana

If you wanna go to war with us, we prepared to bust
Caught that niggaz slippin' at his place, shot him in his face
Now I race, from the scenery, blowin' on greenery
Know I got a temper but you tricks wanna be mean to me

It's the weak, told to tell 'em, Julius Caesar, how he rolls
Newspaper, told to tell 'em, how he just got lnocked of his toes
You should know, that we rollin' deep, hittin' like a train
Kiss the floor, don't be lookin' dumb 'cause I don't explain

I maintain, killaz catchin' drinks, Project cathin' cappers
Shootin' at your muthafuckin' lane, they be catching vapors

Gotta bring twenty strong
Before I can serve your jaws
Double up, man what's up?
Got the pot, rock it up
Mixed it in some be 12's
Now my shit done blown up!
Shake the ball, round the chop
'Til the ball get real hard
Cut me down some twenties
Then I'm standin' out in the yard
Junkies coming back and forth
One tried to run off with dope
Caught him round the corner
And I shot the maggot in the throat
Don't be playin' with my cheese
All I get is 2-0-Z's
One day I'm gone be the fucking man
Out here slangin' keys
Until then, I'm the nigga runnin' from the undercover
Narcotic boys jumpin' fences tryna catch a brother
Happy things is all I hear
But I'm stayin' bout my hog
One day I'll be pushin Lex
But today it's Cutlass dog!

[Chorus]

Slangin' rocks all good with me
Downest bitch that would be me
I be on your side like hip-bone
And nigga you will see
That your misses-lady, your baby
Will cover up what you didn't
You saw that dope that I stuffed in my pussy
I ain't bullshittin'!
So send me out on a mission
We can take they position
We got that china, canary-yellow
We on all you bitches
So come on down
You're the next contestant on my dope list
I'm tryna put some shoes on Rover that i rode in this bitch
And we bout our paper, we shuttin' your block down
We takin' full charge
Can't nothin' be done, til Project Pat said, ""Yo, fuck all of y'all""
I'm from the south
So what you mean, you ain't heard about?
All them birds that's flyin south
That's flyin straight into your mama's house
Don't be sayin you got the clout
Cause we all know who really runnin' thangs
All you bustas must behave
Cause since we came, it ain't gone be the same
I hope you are feeling that
I'm lovin' it
If you liking it
If you want to get caught up in the realest shit

Bucket side blood cooking
Got a problem wit' my style
Wit' the click, wit' the clan

Fuck it's on lightning steel
On the real hoes but they mouth

Automatic gat, get yo' motherfuckin' head crack
Heat tight, trick tight
Killas pullin' pistol plates

All in my face
And he knowing he don't like me

Maybe even fight me
Suck me, paid me
Mane that's what yo' bitch do
Loving me the most cause I let her do the click too
Prophet Posse all these hoes never frontin'
Mane they off that ezay
Gobblin' up somethin'

Slow it down wit' that rough stuff
Five vicious catos curling like a chesse puff
Chesse first cap blast
AC Rolls in the tent

Nothing hoe but the dick
Got me bent out of shape
To you hoes that are fake
Get the fuck out my face
Before I shoot you in ya face
Murder rate, shell increase
Mother-fuck the police
Ridin' up on yo' ass, in ya ass
Be decrease, never peace
Where I live know for the cross-cut
First haters step
First haters get tossed out

Okay did you get locked up and you stay locked up for 2 months
And then you back out
Hold on wait a minute, wait a minute
Now you know I've said it myself
Maybe the nigga got a bond you know what I'm saying
But hold on that nigga got a ankle bracelet?
That's the time he doing time on a ankle bracelet
Or, or check the game, check the game
Not a ankle bracelet but the nigga actually your actually free
Like how the fuck you free and you got caught with some boy
Like everybody know you caught with some boy mane, good bye
How the fuck you free when you got caught with some boy
And nigga out here acting like its all cool, like I'm slow

Some niggas they join it joint it, but I be fucked up up on it
Well we're the Mafia 6, and we ain't bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high we gon' get high, and we gon' haves a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit

Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Woah, where the weed at, ain't like that we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, what's up, fool? Vocal chords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill

Luda, I'm so true to smokin' that stanky buddha
My panky shinin' with diamonds, my index on a Ruger
I wet these hoes in they seat so just call me Freddy Kruger
The Boogie Man, oogie, woogie, give me that oogah, boogah

You can't deny it, no passin' by it, you gotta try it

All in pursuit for a bitch with low self-esteem
(Man she say her pimp is a bitch)
Bitch, what the fuck you mean?
It could seem like I ain't strapped but it's in the holster
2-0-1 a revolvin' door or a roller coaster

Gettin' most of the game from these motherfuckin' jail walls
Hoes can't resist on these streets, hoes kissin' balls
Breakin' pimp laws, bitch that'll get cha' pimp smacked
You ain't got no cheese, oh, that'll get cha' head cracked

Project Pat,"Welcome to the hypnotize zone
Today you'll hear the story of Russell Resthaven
And the day he tried to save his girlfriend
Here's the story

Man, you won't believe what done
Happened to me now, man
What?

I let this nigga come out my house and he fucked my bitch
But I'm gone kill him when he get off work tonight though
Man, fuck dat hoe man, you can't be tryin' to save that bitch
My nigga and them housed the hoe on Brown and Frayser

Man, I spent cheese on her and everything
And I bought rangs and some mo' shit
I'mma kill that nigga dat I'm goin' marry
You can't turn a hoe into a house wife man

I love her man, I love her man
Quit lying man, I love her man
I gotta marry her man
I'mma marry her

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

I'mma introduce me, Project Pat, I keep it real
I'mma introduce you, you's a sucka faking deals
If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life
I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife

I don't even get why you be eating out her draws
You done bought the bitch a phone
Now you screening in all the calls
It's about 4 a.m., she ain't nowhere to be found

Somewhere wit her friend, dick in face and turned to ground
But you best save it last and you know that she'll go
Suckin' dick, chewin' cat, and I hear she on that blow
Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew

Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew
I know just what to do, you can ask the hoe to leave
Once the bitch pack her shit, hurry up and run them streets
Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before
It's a U.F.O. or a hoe that wouldn't go

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Jackie's simple, Jackie's quicker
Jackie likes to suck a dick-a
All she wanna do smoke a blunt get a drink of liquor
Lip-ah to the balls booty even enough to smell dodie

You be tryna, save a sweater but you need the fuckin' letter
Be the bitch she really is-a, suck my dick, you goin' kiss her
Hating hoes, try to dis her every nigga wanna hit her
Get her in the bed lay her down boots wanna fell

Call her up there, nig man there's a way-a
She the star of the foota pussy wet real gooda
Camcorder caught on tape, did I stutter man
I should of fucked her in her mouth fast, she be taking all cash

Keep my tank from Florida she pay for my gas
Ass for my nigga drop-a somewhere tryna watch her
Pregnant by another man but you wanna be the papa
Nut, come, but she crave-a backseat misbehava
You'll never get the bitch 'cause she wit that West Haven

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Got one in the chamber fo you weak ass cowards
And I'm tired of you niggas goin' saving dese bitches
Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get 'em

I ain't trying to be a trick, I'm just sayin my dog
Let a nigga get deep down in them draws
Take her over to my dogs so we can do 'em ya'll
Everybody can do it, let's just have a ball

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Too many niggas out here cowards
They be saving dem hoes they be paying them hoes
But a nigga like me can not go

I'm be kickin' in doos I be fuckin' dese hoes
I be slamin' 'em down like Dominoes
Bitch you didn't know it's CB bro
In and out dese hoes does like, ""Whoa""

Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her
Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her
Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her

On the road like a trucker man had to take some trips
Doing shows for my brothers but strapped with extra clicks

Just in case any sucker would wanna run his lips
A female I don't trust her 'cause women like to trip
I stay all by my getty green hell with some time
There some crime that was petty seem still getting mine

All this hate trip I'm hearing, though you I ain't fearing
Better try to be growing old man with your children
Escalate what a nigga staring his last days nearing
Trying to get it right with God only one who I'm fearing

Hopin' I'ma make it, keep it real
Never knew I get the chances for a nigga to get paid
So I take it living like a player should
Wishin' that you could knowin' it's all to the good
Still down with the hood

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Last year my cousin took a fall, a sad song
Seem like we were just on the phone now he gone
People use to try to judge him sayin' he was wrong
But you can't try to judge a man you do you wrong

Smokin' out on a daily base I'm in the clouds
Drinkin' liqour fallin' on my face
Wondering how I survive all this foolishness
Up in the street ridin' dirty I ain't new to this
I'm packin' heat but the streets very hazardous
To a niggaz health watch your step you ain't Lazarus

You'll meet your death
I'm the man from the North, North site of the town
With the will to support me and keep 'em found
Stayin' down got your gold grills dro in the air
Barbecue on the grill sun cool for a player
When I ride through the streets hoes are plentiful
'Cause the life that we live so beautiful

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Gotta take the good with the bad
Smile with the sad, love what you got
And remember what you had messin' with the ones
Who help me in the times
When I was flat broke didn't even have a dime

My family they was there, my niggaz they was there
The rest of ya'll left me for dead didn't care
I use to have dreams livin' large in this thang
And by the grace of God I'm still alive in this thang

I strive in this game to get all that I can
Never said I'm the man, respect me as a man
To you ones think I owe you somethin'
Now that's a joke, think you bad come

And get you somethin', how low to dope
Either treal either fake, you can love you can hate
Either go and get your own or you can't sit and wait
On the next man to come up you can peep this
You can do what I do handle your business

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Oops wrong hole what she said in the shower
Already hit the booty hole for an hour

CHORUS X 2

Ring around the rosie, pocket fulla posie
Mind full of numbers make these bitches wonder
Let's go smoke an ounce up, maybe tear da house up
Gripp on her ass cause this lads got a big butt
She can make ya touch ground, she can make ya bounce round
She could pack it up make a killin in another town
Shake junt staring, I don't mean no harmin
Call me Mr. Whipple cause I want to squeeze the Charmin
Rubbbin on her back as I suck on her NIPPLE!
Mane dis gal stacked but cheeks like a HIPPO!
Jimmy crack corn I'm gon bust on her LIPPO!

Left the hotel with a limp like a CRIPPLE!
Pretty like highs and her smile had a DIMPLE!
Make her twat hot like a bust on a PIMPLE!

CHORUS X 2

You's a bad young thang baby where yo mane

Got somethin poking out of that short ass dress
You know just whacha doin gal, and you a mess
With yourself, stackin wealth got me on hard
If I getcha in the bed pussy gon' fart
You da strait freak type, and I'm lovin dat

Layin down wit a man, went behind the bar
Catchin me with dope then she take the charge

You ain't gotta love it but you gon learn to respect it bitch

Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth
Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch
Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it south
Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out

Got that south sowed up, got them guns loaded up
Fuckin' with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blowed up
It's a hold up, everybody fold up
Niggaz talk like they tough but they ain't got no nutts, bitch

She can be herself anytime that she get wit' me
Backseat action riverside relaxin'
Flick out the DVD that a** I'm waxin'
I'ma keep it real wit' cha

I don't fight over h*** I'ma let the steel hit cha
All on the town talkin' bad tryna down me
In your heart really sad boy you betta crown me

Oh I, I choose you baby

Hundred spoke rims sittin' slick on the Escalade
Couldna been the king of heart, mane, baby got me paid

First of the year tax time keep me wit' a smile
I'ma get a extra couple g's claimin' yo' child
Yeah that's why I know
This is the world that we living in 
Don't get hot, stya about my game, and quit meddling

Pedalin' in these weed sacks

You can get the seeds back

Do just like I tell her to
And wit' no reneggin'

Branded for life
All the a** I'ma grab it

Where dem hood, hood signs (throw some 'bows, throw some 'bows)

It's the return of the gangsta - like my niggas OutKast
Smokin' on the dank-a - shut ya mouth, I might pass
Niggas off the heezy, fuck all at the fuckin' bar
On the floor or in the parking lot they throw it out the car
If they throw the wrong sign - niggas better handle it
Fuck goin' outside - right here you gettin' wet
I'm glad for this here, all I know is this here
And you thinkin' I'ma let you disrespect this shit here
Before I blow a nigga ass off - him and his hoe
Ready to rob me a bitch and get the fuck out the do'
This shit is real dumb nigga, who fucka say we playin'
Boy you in the wrong land, fuckin' wit a grown man
It's: ""MAFIA, MAFIA"" from the beginning into ending

You know the biz, Three 6 is the name boy
You heard my sign now won't you show me what you claim boy

Somebody run they mouth and then we bop on the bitch
They called us niggas, we run in packs
Some playa hate this skin because the color is black
We sag our jeans, the ride be clean
Them twanky-twin-twins make them rims be mean
We bracing ahead, we trust in the lead
The fool we don't like is police and the Fed.'s
And if you violate - get that tone to the head
And if ya girl approach us - we'll see her in bed
I'll probably own her flick 'cause she ain't nothin' to us
A neighborhood chewer-hut, hoodrat, slut
We people on the left - and we folks on the right
We throwin' up them thangs - and we startin' them fights
The swinging we be doin' is a ugly site
We sleep in the morning and we come out at night

Fuck around and get gun end, straight up out the pen
From the mane with the sawed-off, lay up off the Gin
You can win if you squeeze first - hollow points disperse
You may leave in an ambulance or inside a hearse
Niggas curse when they get caught, then they go to jail
Took a purse with the gold watch - but I can't make bail
Yeah its sad, but I did the crime, I except the time
Just another broke hood nigga - cheese up on my mind
Grab the nine, wanna make change
Suckers lay it down, Project Pat and them Three 6 niggas who get down
'Bout that loot, let the bullets shoot - get across your grill
I'm a North Memphis dinner thief - all about a meal
And I will still retaliate, all you ones that hate
I'm a rider for Hypnotize, move or wrapped in tape
A survivor so realize, catchin' you on late
In the bushes don't be surprise, you gon' meet your fate

Now see it started back in seventy-fo', Teri gave life to Moe
See momma was a hustler, daddy was a buster, y'all know how that go
I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'm a state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs
Man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you wanna know what's in my cup

Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff

Now now now
That 'Purple Stuff', that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'm a go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, clipper
Catch a playa leanin impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the fo' wit a Crush Pineapple
Gotti gon' last long but I ain't sippin wit dat bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a playa had about enough

Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff

Keep the money not folded, in a roll, like a pimp

Now I ain't Don Juan with the magic wand
But I can break a bitch for the cheese an' the funds
I don't have to use a gun, even make the hoe cum
If a nigga go to jail, then a bitch make bond

While you shakin' that ass in the shake jaunt
I be sittin' in the back rollin' big blunts
Let me know when you off to collect my money
If a nigga can't get it then a nigga will hunt

'Cause playas like me don't see nothin' funny
Bitch, better have my motherfuckin' money
Black eyes an' bruisin' up a face, I den done it
To let her know these bonified pimps who run it

She make a G a night but she told me 200
But that's what I get fuckin' wit a snow bunny
I told her like this, I ain't the nigga you be callin'
Police found her body that very next mornin'

Pimpin' for my paper an' I'm lookin' for the chewin'
Bitch, I got to do what the fuck I got to do
Sip an' pop pills, smoke good an' bank spru'

Stupid pussy niggaz actin' all brand new
When they get some money that's what fuck boys do
I ride in the side, get high in the side
Grip on the grain an' get plenty good miles

From the dick suckin' hoes wit a mouth fulla gold
She playin' wit her nose but she suck a mean pole
I can't even lie I like the ghetto ass bitch
That's down for her daddy, ain't scared to break a trick

A yellin' ass, switchin' fast, suckin' while I'm pressin' the gas
In the 6 breakin' bricks, ballin' in the fuckin' mix
Pi M.P. C, bitch, you can't act like you don't know
Get down on ya knees like a top notch hoe

Gator boots an' the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded, in a roll, like a pimp

Gator boots an' the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded, in a roll, like a pimp
When I see you, bitch, you better have my dough, like a pimp
Reach back, like a pimp, slap the hoe

I like to kiss that weak gal movin' tongue with the head
Kind that have a young nigga sprung out in the bed
Kind that'll make a niggas toes curl to his leg
An' that'll tell any mothafucker just what she did

Playa, can you dig as she stroke the esophagus
She can be a stick or big ass hippopotamus
Ain't no fuss, plus her mouth open an' dick's in
Project Pat came to get the cat an' I'm in again

See, I'mma pimp player, hoe layer, money maker, bitch breaker
Purse taker, find me a good worker like a navigator
Drop the slut on the corner with nothin' but baby wipes
Keep that pussy clean an' I'mma see you later on tonight

'Cause first I went an' got the hoe, then I started to work the hoe
Off the whammy, got a Grammy, just the way she brought me though
Then she went an' brought some more, along with a block of yo
Keep your boy, dro, blood, an' some drink waitin' at the door

Gator boots an' the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded, in a roll, like a pimp
When I see you, bitch, you better have my dough, like a pimp
Reach back, like a pimp, slap the hoe

Anybody wit the loot, give it up or I'ma shoot
Bow down M-town, niggaz like to ride clean
Snort on some good dope, smoke on some good green
Friday payday, so I'm at the Shake Junt
Lookin' fo' a big lick, fiendin' for a fat blunt
Saw my victim caught me one slippin'
On the side of the club takin' a pissin'
No mask on face I didn't really need it
He can be damn fool and he'll get heated
Point blank, snatch bank, runnin' like a track star
Heart pumpin' fast like I ate out the crack jar
No one saw me made clean getaway
That means that I still live to get paid

Told the clerk this a robbery nigga drop the bread
Then I ran like a bitch when my folks was outside
So I jumped in the car, mashed the gas start to ride

Nigga should have went to Mexico, my face was on the tube
Most wanted for a felony I should have stayed in class
I was a stupid as nigga I didn't even wear a mask

I guess you know by now the BHZ do not play
My pussy valley are down and gonna spray
They still robbin' niggaz and jackin' fo yo clothes
And have you runnin round like college girls exposed

So we gon all bring guns we gon' all bring pain.

Give me them rings and that fuckin' watch n you
Betta listen up before I start poppin it's me again

Slap on his block wit the glock
And lock'em down to the rocks
Fiendin' for his knot in his pocket strip him
Down his socks, grab and feel this 44
Hopin' steam right off this scope
And I let him smoke If I go in ya pockets and ya broke
Ya got a lotta nuts rollin' my hood on ya twankies

A sucka' play for games, a man play for keeps

I keeps me a nine millimeter just in case

A coward's in my face

These bullets he gon taste


A waste of your life, steppin' wrong, I'm on trees

Best ta leave me alone, best ta go make some cheese

Enemies come in all shapes, forms, sizes, colors

Could be your best friend, cousin, or brothers


I'll rob'em all, just to see who got the fatty stack

Walked in the bank, put the loot in the codauh sack

Slapped on the guard four times fo' he passed out

Eyes on that blow and my pockets was assed out

Had on a trench coat, wig and some goggles

If'n you resist, you may not see tomorrow

I'm in there, I den dared the police couldn't get me

But I made a slip up: had a trick wit me.


Chorus X2:


Don't turn around (Give me the fuckin' cheese trick)

Don't make a sound (Show me where them keys at)

Lay it on the ground (knowing that your pockets fat)

Fore' I buck you down (and I'm quicks' to do that)


Nigga starting braggin' in his hood bout the robbery

Wasn't long then, fore' somebody dropped the dime on me

I'm'a be the one they can't get to, they picked the boy up

Run his mouth just like a fool, he gon' get me fucked up

But, I'm'a have to get to him before the police do-a

Caught up with him night and day, not him and his crew-a

Sprang down Chelsie Ave. kinda in the evening

For this muhfuckas death, dawg I was fiend'n

He was looking at me strange, like I'm'a catcha

I done hopped out with the thang, lemme holla at'cha,

Foo, where you been dog? (My momma got sick, main!)

Fuck that got to do wit'chu? (Hold up I ain't your bitch, main!)

I heard you been talking your muh-fuckin' lips loose (Nah, it ain't like that dawg, I ain't no damn fool)

Looking in his eyes, I could see that he was so scared

I squeezed on the trigga with the gun to his fo'-head.


(Chorus x2)


Blew the top out his skull, now they want me dead

All the niggas in his hood, police and the feds

Stepped out of Westwood, way out of the side

On the other side of town, somewhere I can hide

I done threw my life away, hunted by them by pigs

Robbing every other day, drops in off my nig

They done found my whereabouts, bouts' to do me in

Kickin' in the front door, and I was in the den

SK was under the couch, snatch it off the wham

Open fire on them hoes, I didn't give a damn

Blood stream was full of dope, pump off coca leaf

Feds had me under a scope, and an infrared beam

Rifle bullet threw my throat, chokin', hit tha flo'

Gunpowder in my mouth, knockin' heavens door

Street life done took me out, and that shit ain't fake

I done fuck myself off, cause a bad mistake

At a fuckin' school

And I ain't gon' even try to play ya man

Can ya let me get some weed see my check ain't came?
And a nigga like me I ain't playin' games

You doubt it ya hit it ya outty bout to dream about it
And that's a promise that you can believe if you got cheese
Ya outta cheese three different kinds of weed

We get drunk all shook we in the matrix
My vision's slurred from the sizzurp I'm crazy
I wanna have a Whoopi Goldberg, baby

I mean she got it good she whole and is a lady
I put a bag over her face 'cause it don't phase me
I'm just a gigolo just tryin to get a baby
Maybe it's the drugs I'll tell ya you can't play me

We never had a job but we sittin on a mill

We never wrote a check just them big face bills
A playa drinkin Makers, Marker, cranberry vodka
Wearin a mink coat thats furry as Chewbacca
I saw ya main gal and a playa had to stop her
Her name was the Silkk but her face was The Shocker
The feds takin pictures of us ballin but I got 'em
A 7 footer hole for his body we gon drop 'em

And when they turn they back its the clucka-clucka-rock 'em yeah!

At the hoodie club, that'll make them *** spark a lot

Akademik jeans starched up wit' the Jordans on
Spot a *** ***, get her number and I'm rollin' on
Maybe baby mama mayne, I don't want no drama mayne
She's a ghetto rat, they attract to my diamond rangs

Ain't no thang, when it comes to ballin' nothin' new to me
Fronts in my mouth, part of jewelry and toolery
Cool to be, a hood rich *** from this Memphis
Ridin' in this Cut-Dog, dog, feelin' pimpish, ya dig?

You see these rims flickin' on my car?
(You like, you like)
Buyin' the freshest clothes out the mall
(You like, you like)

I keep my money rolled up in some knots
(You like, you like)
The shiny jewelry I had to cop
(You like, you like)

You see these rims flickin' on my car?

(You like, you like)

Mayne I stayed in them stores, stayed chasin' ***
Stayed ridin' clean, sippin' ***, *** was in my drawers
Stayed in the club, kept a mean mug, had to keep a ***
In my mind I'm the one, so I'm shinin' like the sun

Kept the cottonmouth, reppin' dirty south, stayed housin' broads
A blunt was in my mouth, always schemin' tryna break some laws
Stayed gettin' caught, by them cops, still was on the block
Tryna set up shop, still was slangin' rocks

Always kept a knot, stayed doin' time, still was on the grind
Had to pop that nine, *** gots to shine, had to make 'em bleed
Had to make 'em see, takin' somethin' from the kid
You'll be history, that's for any wannabe

You see these rims flickin' on my car?
(You like, you like)
Buyin' the freshest clothes out the mall
(You like, you like)

I keep my money rolled up in some knots

Some people have heard of him as a hustler
Hell, hope live, really

Street life killed my daddy
Got my momma pregnant in the back of a caddy
Since I lost my first tooth, I ain't been happy
Young wild nigga child, why that boy is so nappy?

He got that devil in I'm police wanna take him down
Used to be a player but the Coochie cost money now
He ain't to bright but he know a trap when he see one
Got is conscious in his pants with his gun

Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though
Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though

Shoe box full of pictures
All that's left of good times I've shared with my niggas
Some alive and some no longer with us
How da, how da, how da hell do you pray for forgiveness?

When you got devil in you
Rogain keeps the hair strong but cocaine keeps the cable on
I can't wait till my nigga JB come home
Why do all the real niggas stay gone so long?

Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though
Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though

Even though a nigga still in the hood, gettin' drunk and smokin' on wood
I'ma make it up out of this street life on the corner is where I stood
Out there all by myself 'cause a player gotta get this mil
Wearin' fur ain't doin' us no good flippin' burgers ain't gon' make you filled

But I'm still ten toes in this hustlin' tryna make hood rich
And I still ain't trustin' no bitch 'cause the mother fuckers always snitch
It's hard in this ghetto man fifteen years old with coke and cane
Cheese don't come I'ma go insane snatch me a purse, snatch me a chain

Out here on the block with the fiends and the moon
Squeeze on the glock tryna pop at a goon
He done stole my dough, he took my food
Project wasn't born with a silver spoon

In my mouth, in my grill wear six chain then niggas get killed
One in the grave the other in jail, nobody wins that's fo' real
Back way when I was a runny nose runnin' round up and down
The town carrying a black glock and a gold frown

I kept that product on me, it wasn't no problem homie
You said it, I had it and met you if you stole my money
Just tryna buy bologna but now I'm buying lobster
Still totin' a glock but pushing a Rolls Royce and winning Oscars

Yeah, 365 Mafia, Project Pat, Lyfe Jennings
If you can believe, you can achieve every damn bug
'Round us a good day, yeah

She had a bag money snatched her bag, let my gun pop
Skeeted off the lot, made a lick, thinkin' it was love
Bag full shredded chase coke, blunt it

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah whats happening?
I'm at this phone booth tell me what you want to do 
Across the street from this dope house, I want the loot
And all the drugs, weed, rocks, quarters, keys, or that juice
I'm about to go in with them guns out ready to shoot
The police rollin' down the block, pull up hold up a second
They just patrolin' I need to get 'em 
The time is now I got my ski mask a K and a pump
I call you back in about an hour with some blocks in the trunk
I'm running across the street, I'm playin' it like a beast
With chains on my hands, shackles on my feet
My second robbery, my heart rate just increased
I'm kicking down the black door, put 'em up

[Chorus: x2]

Now don't show it if you ain't goin' share it
Fuck around and get your pistol across your head
You better look like the hood when you roll through it
Or find your monkey ass leaking red and gray fluid
They will do it, my dogs meaner then them laws
We ain't sellin', you ain't comin' in our hood to fuck with Paul
Make his car alarm go off as soon as he step out
We comin' from the side of the house with them pumps out

Para de pedir milagre pro seu Deus
Aproveita e pede perdão
Pede, pra saciar seu monte de distúrbios
E diz que pra sarar a terra dele vai precisar dois dilúvios inteiros

200 Noites de chuva pra limpar as impurezas
300 Dias de morte pra matar as tristezas
Porque os irmão 'tão se matando por dólar, por fome
Por bola, por mulher, por pedra, por cola
Vejo um tanto de vida que vem e vão
Pensava que fosse as morte
Até que vejo que as vida que são em vão
Um sobe e desce de alma sem corpo
Com tanto corpo sem alma aqui só vagando sem direção

As vezes é difícil ver luz que faça acreditar
Se cada um de nós tem sua cruz pra carregar
Porque nem todos levam chicotada
Porque o salário dos irmãozinho é um recibo de nada
É o negro de pele clara
Branco de pele escura
Vejo os dois lados e não vejo nenhum da fechadura
Só vejo um lado da fixa ditadura
Vejo por todos lado o que eles chamam de vida dura
Já me disseram que eu sou branco demais pra ser preto
Já me disseram que eu sou preto demais pra ser branco
A cor não importa
Porque quando você vem do gueto
Detector sempre apita na porta do giratória do banco

Depois reclama se 'cê ouve facção
Julgam que são nocivos pros moleques que 'tão no mundão sem sorte
Não é preciso amor pra gerar uma vida
Mas a falta desse amor muitas vezes nos leva a morte
E as histórias são sempre as mesmas por aqui
Quem morreu ontem ou quem já foi jurado pra cair
Quem só se esconde ou quem achou um lado pra trair
'Tá a espera do apocalipse abre o jornal, 'tá aí
Para de vê as imagens
Lê as noticia
Depois me diz quem 'tá errado ladrão ou policia
Depois me diz quem é culpado quem mata ou quem morre
Depois me diz quem é safado o que ataca ou o que corre

Você escolhe um
Bem, mal, fraco, forte, Buda, Ogum,
Muito pouco, nada, tudo, ser, não ser, morrer, viver
Só fazer peso na terra
Deus te deu arma, não te pediu pra ir pra guerra
Deus te deu alma, você decide o quanto erra
Não importa qual Deus você escolher
Mas precisa acreditar em algo
Mesmo que seja só em você
O mundo tenta desviar dizendo estamos sós
Diz que a luz só existe nos seus faróis
Eu acredito em Deus mesmo sem escutar sua voz
Porque mesmo com tudo isso ele ainda dá outra chance pra nóis
Sinceramente também acredito em vocês
Acredito em mim
Liberdade, talvez
Mesmo com toda desgraça do mundo
Pra alertar meus irmão, vagabundo, eu nasceria outra vez
E hoje eu nasço e faço com meu rap o que uma carta faz
Mas deixo uma observação atrás
Que se a sua esperança morreu
Irmão fudeu
Ela era a ultima a morrer
Você já não existe mais

Eu lembro, eu quase consigo ver
A gente subindo aquela rua de terra
Ele dizia pra eu não chorar se não ele choraria também
Ela tava se preparando pra nos deixar 
Ou nos preparando pra nos deixar

Hoje a minha família é grande demais
É imensa

Eu levantava e saía pra trabalhar
Escrevia um bilhete de bom dia pra te deixar
Vestia a primeira roupa que eu encontrasse por lá
Engolia um pão com manteiga e um suco de maracujá
Tomava meu banho sem ter você lá pra bagunçar
Deitava mais um minuto pra saudade amenizar
Te dava um beijo no rosto de leve pra não acordar
E dizia te amo sem você poder escutar

Entrava, rodava a catraca e sentava no fundão
Com fone no ouvido ouvindo algum rap boladão

Chegava no meu trabalho com vontade de sair
Seu cheiro na minha roupa mas você não tava ali
Abria a gaveta que me fazia sorrir
Porque tinha uma foto que eu tirei vendo você dormir

Fazia amor com você até minha perna bambear

No início é difícil, mas vai se acostumar
O sofá é um péssimo vício, vai te acomodar

Enquanto uns 'tão falando
Disseram que era moda
E eu segui trabalhando
Os bico se incomoda
Porque a moda 'tá durando
Salve-se quem puder

Voltei com mais vontade, mostrei habilidade
Trazendo novidade, cheguei na sua cidade
Toquei seu coração, lutei pela cultura
Nessa vida dura e mantive os pés no chão

Ai que saudade dos tempos da Central
Ouvindo um freestyle do Kamau
No bolso ninguém tinha um real
Mas tinha rap, os amigos e era fenomenal

Eu tenho muita saudade de vocês
E penso, será que vai haver outra vez?
Um hip-hop com menos picuinha, com menos ladainha
E menos caras pensando que eles são reis

E mesmo se eu ga-ga gaguejasse pra fa-fa falar
Ou se eu errasse o po-po português pra ca-can cantar
Ainda assim fa-fa faria muito mais
Do que quem fala bonito mas só fala e não faz

Fé, pra me manter de pé, enquanto eu puder

Renato Russo e Elis também
Cresci entre Sabotage e Kurt Cobain

Não tenho a melhor levada nem me acho flow man
Não sou o mais comentado, porém
Talvez eu seja o mais consciente
Que ninguém é mais que ninguém

Pois bem
A sorte foi lançada, a ultima jornada
Te vejo na chegada
Sei que cada pegada minha tem sangue e suor
Porque eu me preocupei em fazer bem
E não em ser melhor
Chega pra somar, ou então suma
Falar só por falar é mato, então resuma
Mas antes de falar de alguém assuma
Eu sei que o vocês fizeram no verão passado

Cantando alto e claro aquele bonito louvor
Encarando seu espírito ao lado do seu corpo em pé
Implorando pra que se arrependa se puder
E eu vi o seu corpo tremendo com o seu coração parado
Uma lágrima escorrendo com seu olho fechado
O povo todo olhando extasiado
E cada uma das câmeras pifando
Pro segredo ser guardado
A rezadeira parou de cantar, e pra você sorriu
Os anjos voltaram pro céu, e então o seu olho se abriu
E eu chorei testemunhando com vocês
Quando eu vi sua mãe te dando a luz pela segunda vez

Vagabundo vai correr, vai brincar
Vai chover, vai sujar
Deixa o menino jogar, que é Sexta-feira
Pra proteger é que existe a rezadeira

A saudade muitas vezes faz bem
Ela disse que queria voar

No mundo louco, eu sou mais louco que o mundo
E o mundo me faz ir ficando mais louco ainda
E aos pouco eu fico tão louco e me sinto capaz

Só quem sofreu poderá dizer que já sentiu o amor
E aí já sofreu?

Tanto faz, tanto fez
Não dá nada, dessa vez
Vou lutar por vocês
E quando tudo for melhor
Eu vou ligar pra ela

Eu vou ligar pra ela

Graças a Deus eu nasci assim
Guerreiro ligeiro, sempre sonhador
O jogo 'tá sempre no Hard pra mim
Mas deixa assim, porque eu sou jogador
Gritei pro meu santo me mandar sinais
Também nessa terra fui longe demais
Pro santo sou burro por buscar a paz
Mas se eu buscasse a guerra seria bem mais

E o mundo me faz ir ficando mais louco ainda

Eu tenho um dia a mais pra viver
Um dia a mais pra sonhar
Um dia a mais pra correr
Um dia a mais pra lutar

Barba cabelo e bigode
Pesado assim como pode?
Saiam da frente oh vagabundo não fode

Tudo morre em meio a essas multidões
Entre vidas, imensidões e perdidas almas
Idas e vindas de sonhos
Sonhos em plantações colheitas em prestações
E as chuvas que levaram à lavoura dos meus sonhos
Mendiguei pela vida
Chorei na avenida
Da amargura alma pura, pura dor recebida

Mantido em cálices de suor
Não quero ser melhor
Se eu for melhor do que já fui
Já não serei o pior
Porque hoje eu tenho um dia a mais pra sofrer
Um dia a mais pra chorar
Um dia a mais pra aprender
E um dia a mais pra tentar
O objetivo é claro raro e sincero
E é claro meu caro não paro
E se não paro acelero

O meu bonde é pesadão Shan Kingston
Ligeiro tipo bonde novos recordes quebrarão
O rap é fato negão, e é fato que a missão é o rap
No topo e se eu topo e boto no fogo a mão
Digo que é óbvio que agora é virar, mas só virar
Pra quem tiver memória e uma boa história pra contar
Se um dia é velório, teremos banquete amanhã
Mente sã, mas tudo pá isso que eu quero

Me lembra os otários caindo ao léu
'Tá bonito relógio, cabelo com gel
Agora mostra sua alma cruel

Define quem é quem pra mandar
Por mais que você imagine que alguém sempre há
Alguém pra que te discrimine na vitrine só quem pode pagar
E no biquíni só quem pode malhar
Mas vai mudar

Porque hoje eu tenho um dia a mais pra escrever
Um dia a mais pra cantar
Um dia a mais pra perder
E um dia a mais pra ganhar

Bolado mais bolado que nunca pesado
Quem gosta gosta, quem não gosta fala bosta coitado

Não tenho tudo que quis mas com certeza
Eu tenho tudo que fiz
E fiz feliz por ser quem sou por ter meu dom por só precisar de um giz
Diz que me diz, diz muita coisa mas não vê minha raiz
Eu vi a terra se abrindo
Eu vi o céu caindo

Um furacão se aproximando e tudo aqui sucumbindo
Tive medo
Mas o segredo é que eu venci o meu medo
Estalei os meus dedos e disse pode vir
Pois até padre Quevedo teria medo aqui

Mas o ódio é inevitável pra quem tem medo de amar
E eu me entrego quando canto, tanto pranto já secou
No entanto me levanto e janto esses otários lá
Dá um teco, só um teco, eles diziam pra eu tentar
Escapei pelas beiradas nada pode me parar

Que eu mudei só pelo fato de eu querer movimentar

Mas o louco é que eu sempre fiz jus, sempre carreguei

Mas você não vai vir me cumprimentar, juro que ali vou sofrer
Vai doer, mas eu vou compreender que a nossa historia tinha hora pra acabar 
Então Deus que te abençoe seja feliz
Saiba que em tudo que fiz nunca quis te decepcionar 
Mas se a vida é assim enfim, pra nós isso é o fim 
Jogue a culpa em mim, pois nunca vou te culpar

Tem um cuzão de terno rindo a cada desistência
Não é ciência, esse é o RAP em ação
É foco, força, fé, coragem e coração

Os meninos tão na rua, os meninos tão de pé
Os meninos não fazem as coisas como a gente quer
Mundo louco que corrói a alma de quem ama
Pode mandar mais vilões porque isso só enriquece a trama

Brasil, Planeta Terra
Cachoeirinha em 86, o começo da Guerra
Minha família ora, quando eu desço pra lá
Minha família chora se eu demorar a voltar

No meu mundo, dinheiro trás comida pra minha mesa
Lá fora eu vi ele levando maldade e frieza
Cobiça por umas tiriça
Loucura!
Justiça só contra nós, não é justiça
É ditadura!

Nossa postura é um homem cego sem cão guia
Lá fora o ódio incondicional te dá bom dia
Cada dia longe é duro suportar
Deixa a louça na pia que hoje eu memo vou lavar

Eu desci a ladeira pra ver o que tinha por lá
E voltei
Pra poder te contar que eu sempre vou voltar

E tudo ia mudar, e eu lutei
Vários me disseram que eu nunca ia chegar, duvidei
Lembra da ladeira, meu?
Toda Sexta-feira meu melhor amigo é Deus e o segundo melhor sou eu

Eu tanto quis, tanto fiz, tanto fui feliz
Eu canto Xis, canto Péricles, canto Elis
Torcedor do Santos, desse pão e sei que eu também quis
Não sei feliz, mas geral merece não ser infeliz

Prosperei com o suor do meu trabalho
Me guardei, lutei sem buscar atalho
E sem pisar em ninguém
Sem roubar também, então sei
Que hoje o meu nome é Foda e meu sobrenome é Pra Caralho

Deus olhou pra mim, disse assim, escuta neguin
Pegue esse caderno e escreve cada folha até o fim
Eu disse Senhor, sou tão tímido, sinto mó pavor
Só no subir no palco a perna congelou

Mas rodei o Brasil, CD na mochila foi cinquenta mil
Mão em mão, na rodoviária passando mó frio
Quem viu, viu, Curitiba meu tesouro, foi estouro
Vinte e cinco mil, tio, DVD de ouro

Triunfo bombou, Leandro estourou, Michel prosperou
Dei valor, só trabalhador, homens de valor
Minha cor não me atrapalhou, só me abençoou
Quem falou que era moda, hoje felizmente se calou

Vai, vai lá, não tenha medo do pior
Eu sei que tudo vai mudar
Você vai transformar o mundo ao seu redor
Mas não vacila, moleque de vila, moleque de vila, moleque de vila
Não vacila, moleque de vila, moleque de vila, moleque de vila

Já fui vaiado, já fui humilhado, já fui atacado
Fui xingado, ameaçado, nunca amedrontado
Aplaudido, reverenciado, homenageado
Premiado pelos homens, por Deus abençoado

Avisa o Rony que hoje é nós, não tem show, tô sem voz
Se o Danilo não colar, vou buscar de Cross
Se o Marques chegar, grita o Magrão, liga, mó função
Tem churrasco, sem fiasco, tira espinha do salão

Já cantei com Mano Brown, com Edi Rock, com Helião
Com D2, com MV, dei um abraço no Chorão
Aprendi fazer freestyle no busão
Hoje é o mesmo freestyle, só que a gente faz no fundo do avião

E hoje eu acordei chorando porque eu me peguei pensando
Será que lá de cima a minha véia segue me olhando?
Será que se me olhando, ela ainda 'tá me escutando?
Será que me escutando, ela ainda 'tá se orgulhando?

Hoje tanto faz, putaria 'tá demais
Mas ninguém se liga mais, mas ninguém respeita os pais
Mas pra mim tanto faz porque ainda tem Racionais
Pra quem quer um diferente, tem Oriente e Haikass

Raps nacionais, rostos diferentes, mesmos ideais
Salve, Sabota, e todo Rap sem lorota
Os mano gosta de ir no Twitter xingar o Projota
Mas trai a mulher e não abraça a mãe, faz uma cota

Desde os dezesseis tô aqui, outra vez, vou sorrir
Vou cantar, vou seguir
Vou tentar, conseguir
Se quer falar mal, fala daí
Mas meu público grita tão alto que já nem consigo te ouvir

Olha lá o outdoor com o meu nome
Me emocionar não me faz ser menos homem
Se o diabo amassa o pão, você morre ou você come?
Eu não morri e nem comi, eu fiz amizade com a fome

Vai, vai lá, não tenha medo do pior
Eu sei que tudo vai mudar
Você vai transformar o mundo ao seu redor

Se eu tive a minha, me calar é omissão, 
Faço como a as rabiola no fio, 
O vento tenta me levar, mas permaneço onde o destino me encubiu, ouviu?

Um ideal não se desfaz nem que a vida se acabe

Que eu vejo sempre? Só quatro, Que eu posso contar? Só três!

1 Abraço e mais 3 palavras vale mais que 'cê pensa
Eu queria
Que as neuroses que eu tenho fossem só
Sair domingo com a minha mãe
Pra visitar minha vó
No fim foi com a vó que eu cresci
E o que me faz gritar
É saber que a minha mãe tá longe demais pra nós visitar
E seja lá onde for, me olhe por favor
Não posso tocar sua pele, mas eu sinto seu amor
É foda, quando o sentimento se solta
Você chora ao ver que já passou 10 anos e ela não volta

Reclama se ela te abraça na frente dos aliados

Só que na hora que aconteceu eu não tava lá

E eu não tenha alcançado o que você esperava de mim
Eu não vou culpar Deus, o mundo é dos espertos
E lá no lugar dele eu também ia te querer mais por perto
Tudo que absorvi, o que contigo aprendi
É o que me fez ser homem muito antes de MC
Cada cintada nas pernas me fez aprender
Que eu tinha que ser calejado e forte pra viver sem você
E eu te dedico aqui minha melhor poesia
Composta pela alegria de ser o seu filho
E pela agonia, de ver meu pai, que é meu herói, chorando
Meu irmão gritando, minha vó entrando em pânico,
E a dor aumentava
E cada vez que eu caí nessa vida,
O quanto eu sofri nessa vida,
Chamei por ti nessa vida, e não te encontrava
Mas hoje eu sei que não fiz nada sozinho,
A cada passo, a cada respiração
Você tava dentro de mim,
Um vira-lata sem dono e sem lar
Deixa a minha cama arrumada,
Qualquer dia eu vou aí te visitar

Quem falou, quem bebeu, quem surtou, quem morreu
Quem casou, separou, quem chorou, se vendeu
Se a roupa é curta, 'tá mostrando e se cobrir se escondeu
Se engordou, se emagreceu querem saber o que comeu

Zé povinho digital é esse o seu nome
Olho gordo virtual que xinga depois some
Se alimenta de curtidas e 'tá sempre com fome
Nem cirurgia desgruda sua mão do smartphone

Isso aí não é moda é um estilo de vida
De esquecer da própria vida pra cuidar de outra vida
Esquece de viver, pro trabalho não vai
Mas nunca esquece de pagar o Wi-Fi

A vida é assim muitos vão te julgar, mas no fim
Eles querem o seu lugar e o objetivo é negativo
É destrutivo, eles estão vivos por um único motivo
É porque tudo o que eles querem é mais like

Mais like, mais like, mais like
Vão falar de você
Vão tentar te dizer como deve viver
Mas ae, eu sei que tudo o que eles querem é

Mais like, mais like, mais like, mais like
Vão falar de você, vão tentar te dizer como deve viver
Mas ae, eu sei que tudo o que eles querem é mais like

Me desculpa, mas preciso dizer
Ninguém sente inveja de você
Nem tudo é recalque, fazer o quê?
Você tem que ser o sol pro mundo
Girar em torno de você

Pera aí, pera aí silêncio no tribunal
Julga, julga, julga, julgamento em tempo real
Fala, fala, falador se sentiu
Sua sensação de poder é tão falsa
Quanto o seu perfil

Onde vive hein? Isso eu não sei dizer
Gente assim não tem endereço, tem IP
Tem um terabyte de HD
Pena que o seu cérebro não utiliza
A memória do PC

Vou dizer pra você como 'cê tem que ser
Faz de conta que nem viu 'cê vai ver
Se a vingança é um prato que se come frio
Isso é mole o desprezo é um prato podre
Que se engole

Que nunca me impeça de tentar tudo que eu posso
Que nunca me ajude mesmo quando eu te implorar

Fui pro inferno doze vezes e treze voltei
Chorei de novo ao ver o mundo que aqui encontrei
Fui pro inferno outra vez e dessa vez fiquei

A vida é um som pesado e intenso
Eu sinto e nem penso, e só ouço no talo

Algo desse tipo, mas isso é São Paulo
Chamam de Sampa onde você trampa
Junta seus bagulho pra ver ir pro ralo
Eu sou Patrick, sou Sávio, sou Jonata
Sou os dois Matheus, eu vim de Maricá
E não vão tocar isso na televisão
Mas algum coração eu sei que vai tocar
Porque tudo passa, eu sei que a dor passa
Mas tem dores que nunca devem passar
E eu posso até não mudar o mundo
Mas um vagabundo que ouvir isso aqui vai mudar

Prolific,"(PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's
So I gotta rep for the PJ's
The elevators with the pissy hallways
Bangin on the project walls, all day

Yo if it wasn't for the PJ's y'all probably never heard of me
Y'all be like, ""Who the hell is Wyclef, and what's a Fugee?""
I'd probably be standin on a corner, watch you approach
Steal ya dope, sell ya coke, then snatch ya rope
Run for brokes with the cash and the jewels
Bulls eye, I hold my breath when I shoot
The reason you should hold ya breath; 'cause most thugs
When they breathe and shoot tecs, they aim right but shoot left
Now they flesh being swept off the surface
If you ain't B.I.G. then you ain't Notorious
So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat
Someone bring him a bed, to the permanent sleep
Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath
Don't matter if you use a desert eagle as your armor
Blood splatter, glass shatter through the project slums
Another one in the obituary column son

(PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's
So I gotta rep for the PJ's
The elevators with the pissy hallways
Bangin on the project walls, all day

(PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's
Wrote my first rhyme in the PJ's
You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's
The PJ's! PJ's

Before I was signed, I used to move on the grind
All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme
Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line
To prison and take a message to Shyne
Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero
It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow""
Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough
You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal
It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin
""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine
In the projects God, nuttin come easy
Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy
Move like a professional, young thug funeral
What ya thought this was another Pepsi commercial?
Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it
Wyclef the president, the PJ's elected him

So I gotta rep for the PJ's
The elevators with the pissy hallways
Bangin on the project walls, all day

(PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's

You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's
The PJ's! PJ's

Yeah, and to the teachers that said I wouldn't live
And my remains would be found under the Verizano Bridge
Well I'm alive teach! So put ya theory to rest
I ain't Makaveli but I might fake my death
Make no mistake, I'm a hip-hop artist
Before the diamond in the Billboard, the hood charted it
Surburbia bought it, we bootlegged it, we couldn't afford it
'Cause in the PJ's we undergroudn like black markets
The 'P' stand for public housing
The 'R' is for respect that ya get, when ya hold down ya set
The 'O's for ounces that we flip into keys
The 'J's for the judgement handed by the ju-ry
The 'E' is for enter, at your own risk
You know the 'C' that's for the cats that's out to get rich

So I never have to deal with you again
Again, again

And away we go
Away we go
Away we go
Away we go, we go

I'm sorry, won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away
The best thing that ever happened to you

Forget my name and forget my face
Hope you hit your head and your memory gets erased
So I never have to deal with you again, again
",Away We Go,2005
Promise of Redemption,"It's hard to believe much of anything these days
When every thing falls all around you what can you say
When all of the words that float so easily just won't come
It's hard to believe that my whole body can feel this numb

Just try to remember

Been twirling my hair, that same habit you know that I have
When I close my eyes this whole situation just seems so bad
But I still got a memory, these pictures of you will never leave my side
And Lord knows I'm hurting, but every one knows it hurts to say goodbye

It's just the one thing I've been having the most trouble with
Is when I try my best, you know I do to just describe
The way that when you looked at me it's like it's heaven sent
And those most beautiful eyes

And I've been waking up at night beside this nervous tick
?Cause I just don't know if it's possible to get through this
And it's just me and all of your best friends they're by my side
They're trying, oh so hard to wipe these tears of off my eyes

Just try to remember

Just how it felt
Just how it felt

I find it hard to believe that you were taken from me
And all of your family, it doesn't make sense
How all these pictures and frames makes it hard to explain
The way that it rains, it's you crying

So I'll hold on to belief that one day we?ll be at peace
And when you look down on me you know I'm trying
Just to show the whole world how amazing you are
And when I see all those stars I know you're shining

I knew someday that you would fly away
Love is the greatest healer to be found

I will still remember

Verse 1 (Joe Flizzow- Too Phat, Malaysia)
Yo, Joe Flizzow
First to go on this track
Transcending continents
Who better
To hold it down for Malaysia?
Ain't no argument
I'm eloquent
With my words
And linguistics that I abuse
MC's wanna bite
But still got on
Some loose baby tooth
My rhymes so hot
We got fire blankets
In the vocal booth
Producers with extinguishers
To put out the blaze
When I'm on the loose
I'm rolling with the best
Meeting of the minds
Not a contest
Evoking MC's around the globe
With finesse and skills God blessed
From KL
But a hungry MC
Like I was from Budapest
Too Phat to go on diet
Toe to toe with Joe is ludicrous
Don't fool with this
You know we fly
Like a stewardess
Impressing pure hip-hop purists
In every single metropolis
Don't step to this listen
Rubbish we don't utter
Got to stop the hating
Unite us and start working together
So keep it butter
We'll kick it hotter
Than your average MC
They'll flee
We'll make 'em stutter
C'monâ?¦

Verse 2 (Promoe- Loop Troop, Sweden)
'Cause I look so good
Your first thought is
Somebody else
Must've wrote this
But no ish
It's like God comin' down
To the pen when I rip it
God comin' out my mouth
When I spit it
God comin' out the sleeve
When you break out the record
Put it on your turntable
Instant connection
From me to you
With infinite love
Music must've been
Sent from above
To free the people
And treat them equal
Make us humble
'Cause only the meek will
Inherit the earth
And perish the dirt
Righteousness will cover the world

I'm certified, kid
It's over when your mic drops

With the focus of a Cyclops
Battering beats

Ever gonna stop me

Freestyle is infinite
My mind's a temple
I reside in its pyramid
I know ya' hearing it
I feel your attention
Your thirst quenching

Ain't here to spoil it

Different toilet
But as I counterstrike
This be a day of defeat

Rappers scared to say my name

Skip the arrogant comparisons
We won't be here

Students still collide
To keep they peeps rights
We hostin' different ghettos
Different sounds each night
No drive by's in caddies
Clocking marks
Up on the east side
No kids with 40's
Shootin' dices under street lights
And buck guns
Here thugs swingin' samurais
In street fights
But buck a where I resides
As long as the beat's nice
I keep my rhymes precise
And when it recites
It makes you
Wanna peep twice
Impressin' each type
In each tribe
From jail to kids in Yale
To tribal Indians
Blowin' peace pipes
And buck the cheap hype
Your metaphors are re-writes
Your style is like tryin'
Your granny panties on
Could never be tight
The type that chicks like
Dudes wanna be like
And while you jerkin' offa free sites
I'm doin' three dykes, uuh
Yeah, I'm a Malay kid
And no

The type a A&R will tell Dre

",6 MC's,
Promoe,"I'm all city like graffiti, better yet all country
'Bout to go all planet if it goes the way I planned it
Fanatic fan addict but a man at it
Loop Troop's a sickness now we're lettin' Japan have it
Givin' a bad habit no matter who distributes
No matter what record label I gotta spit the truth
The illest troop you can't keep a good sound down
In Tokyo my shit is heard around town
I'm screamin' on emcees: unless you drop gems please
Shut the fuck up, hand over your benz' keys
The way I see things in Europe, nobody's fuckin' with this
And in the states, well I don't really want to dis
But some rappers take hip hop for granted
Watch me run up in their spot like Moh and Mike mechanic
Panic! When my rhymes cross the Atlantic
Then cross the pacific if it goes the way I planned it
Fanatic fan addict but a man at it
Loop Troop's a sickness now we lettin' Japan have it!

You diggin' me man, Loop Troop big in Japan
Kick the real shit and get three million fans
World supremacy P-R-O-M-O
I said you diggin' me man Loop Troop is big in Japan
Spit that rah rah shit and get six million fans
World supremacy S-U-P-R-E-M-E

Hell yeah this be Supreme from the Loop Troop singers
Known for hit singles and stiff middle fingers
Just ring us, then bring us for the time of your life
We'll forever be a part of your life 'cause of your two timing wife
Tout le monde we world wide
Your fan base is your man's place they thought your tape was aight
Since you ain't nothing in the streets you pose to be a club thug
All hyped up but never really done shit like that millennium bug
'Cause of the drugs, sex and alcohol
I'm in this to rip the clubs, decks and microphones
In Tokyo and former Russia
Informers rush the set 'cause of we hollerin' anarchy like Busta
And cuss the downpressor men from the top of my lungs
Till they start makin' sense and be dropppin' their guns
Once my crew gets to speak out they freak out
This ain't supposed to leak out we ain't supposed to sneak out
The back door with black dough, Loop Troop is like whoa
Conquerin' the world in two triple O's
So do panic, that bull shit can it
My crew's a sickness and now we letting Japan have it

You diggin' me man Loop Troop is big in Japan
teach the youths the truth and get ten million fans
World supremacy 'cause to the M-I-C

It's the D-V-S-G entrepreneurs
Cruisin' through the underground systems to the Japanese sewers
Nobody boo us they more like sayonara
Glad you came, it's the bomb! Aight peace we feel honored
We stand as one build as one swarm
And travel to the other side of the planet to perform
I look to the east (why?) yo do I even have to mention it
This western world got us trapped in censorship
'Cause everything that I say is political
And everything that I write makes me a suspected criminal
Subliminal advertising behind enemy lines
You'll find the message between the lines when you rewind
Starting point right here we just landed
Loop Troop's the illest virus now we're lettin' Japan have it

Diggin' me man, Loop Troop big in Japan
Building a plan to get millions of fans

Shit son I got my notice of eviction
next day they hit me with an unjust conviction
What is this fiction? I ain't in to superstition
but somebody's on a mission to fuck with me
Everybody's in on it from record labels to travel agents
to government agents and radio stations
And people cancelling shows those damn silly hoes
same cowards that won't air our videos
Too hot for TV and banned from radio
and when's the album droppin' fans are waiting yo
This one is for y'all I hope you're hearing me
we all got a job to combat the conspiracy...

[Chorus]
Against DVSG's
every single industry always deceiving me
It's a conspiracy against DVSG's
they're out to get Embee, Cosmic, Supreme and me

After I wrote this rhyme I hade to eat the paper
and after hearing this rhyme you might meet your maker
Cus anybody with this knowledge is considered a risk
so if you see the police kid get rid of the disc
And if you're scared of getting family members murdered
turn the music off right now pretend you never heard it
Any brave soul still out there ready to hear my story
about how the whole world is conspiratory
Nah I'm not paranoid I always got a pair of boys
in blue on the look out for me and my crew
It's a fact the government consider our music a threat
and they ain't happy until Loop Troop crew's in a net
They want us losing our necks to keep the fool's in a check
but yo schlooks and schlookettes they ain't ruling us yet
They want to stop our communication with the world's population
cus on popular demand we bring hip hop emancipation

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They want to shoot us up they want to shoot us down
they want to lock us up they want to lock us down.
They want to bruck us up they want to bruck us down
they want to fuck us up they bring the ruckus now.

They don't like the likes of us
They don't like the lines I bust
They do like to fight and fuss
and claim that I don't have the right to cuss
Well I keep spitting till the mike a rust
I keep giving that type of rush
I make the youths them hype enough
for po po to pull out the nines and cuffs
And I smash their face red like a blush
I turn the crowd into psycho thugs
I turn hip hop spots into biker clubs
and make the scene explode like dynamite and such
And they can't stop this fire burning
they can't top this higher learning
They got cops and sly attorneys
foolish dogs keep barkin' at this flying bird it's...

That they publicize double-ized, In a love disguise,
Wolf in a sheep clothing, I just love these guys,
Talking about freedom of speech, freedom of the word,
It's a well-known fact you need cash to make your self heard with,
Topics like this, they don't let literally to stop me,

That don't make no revolution, so what I'm I to do then,
Rather die lugging then get my message diluted,

Want substances, not all saints

They want you to think, life is about chasing the riches
But that materialistic shit will fade away
Don't get caught up in the modern day slavery tray

At a faster pace than formula 1 racing
Blaming the problems of society, on immigration
When in Sweden may guns export it to poor nations
Causing wars and starvation's
Killing Africans and Asians
Calling it ""foreign relations""
And it's all an annihilation's
Yo, you forced them to leave their homeland
For an unknown land
The look upon them, is more barbaric than Conan
They asking for work, and you say 'no man, you can't be trusted'
They walked down your street and get busted
By your so-called justice
Designed to change mines
To put you in the lead, and the others behind

Cause you have used the mass-escape quote again

Watch the evil world they create
And how they celebrate their great state
Thx 1138, if you're real you can relate
To how they watch every move we make
And how they decimate the human race
Well if this ain't the last days
Then it sure is pretty late

I see hate (no face) in the eyes on the walls
And it's hard to show love back they freeze ice on your balls
It's a cold world despite the green house effect
They fight the fact that my team got respect
To them my team's a suspect and I admit you can't trust us
But ain't no justice it's just us the small time hustlas
Being thoroughly inspected
Every day and every night we're being casted and directed
In the world's greatest soap opera Truman show for true man, yo
I'm not stupid I won't stoop down low
Although I creep on a diggi low cus bigger bro
want to broadcast my ass live on a video
But I escape the big screen and the piggsvin
Team up with the dope friends to put up a smoke screen
To blind your cameras eye sight too much unwanted limelight
It's not like I get a spot light cus I rhyme tight
But cus of their so called crime fight that's why I use my mic
To let the vandals and the thiefs of the world know the time's right
If you hate the system unite tonight
Tomorrow when we wake up it'll be allright

[Chorus]

Every action has it's reaction what you expected?
This actor without a pay check will react with hatred
I stay dread burn and loot what they hold sacred
Incarcerated scarred faces but we can make it
On the low in between the lines like me and Timbuk
We've been fucked too long to just lay down and give up
So big up all the disobedient crews
The deviant crews who don't believe in the news
Who be seeing straight thrue the lies with their eyes on the prize
Freedom, don't give a fuck about ice
The spies lurk on every street corner
Record every move you make like big brothers of Warner
They shoot a reel then they shoot you for real
To hold you still they give you alcohol and pills
If you feel like graffiti is more than just a fashion
It's lights, camera, legal action!

Prompt,"Paseando el otro dia en la maÃ±ana
me encontre un amigo de la niÃ±ez
hablaba con nostalgia de la infancia
que dura se ha vuelto la vida despues.

Que largos parecian los dias
eternas las tardes sin saber que hacer
ahora el tiempo pasa y no perdona
se van meses y aÃ±os para no volver.

Quien te ha visto, amigo, y quien te ve
como te va la vida, a mi me ha ido bien
tan lejano el paraiso aquel
estoy acostumbrado a vivir al este del Eden.

Que es lo que tiene el aire en la maÃ±ana
que limpia los temores de mi corazon
las dudas que anoche eran tinieblas
son simples tonterias a la luz del sol

Prong,"The Ways Of Your Way


I'm Lost In Disbelief
How Can You Breathe Freely

And Look At What You See


The Space That You Tread


What You Do Perceive

Your Objects Of Desire
I Know They're Not For Me





Not Forgetting All The Crimes


All I Can Now Cry
Neither Nor The Lesson
Your World's Not Mine
Your World's Not Mine



I See What I Touch

Burn In My Own Dreams


No Feeling For Your Life
Your World Can't Be Seen

Prong,"You make the right moves, I beg to differ
Rather be a fool and see things clearer
You found a quick way to fill your pocket

I beg to differ
Disharmony amongst all our brothers

For dear life! For dear life! For dear life! For dear life!
You're holding on for dear life

I said ""aces is full pal how about you?"" 
He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two

And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette

And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate

Yanahmean when I do these interviews
Just wanna let em know (we ballin)
You gotta strap up cause niggas'll test you
Whenever you feel that pressure
You let em know everyday of your life is, check it

[Verse 1 - Memphis Bleek]
For real we still killin 'em and, each one of 'em
You know the flow like caine, look it's numbin 'em
Look what I done to them, they want run wit 'em
I let 'em stay few nights but then I'm done wit 'em
Mami you rollin, get your clothin
You know one sight of the mansion will get 'em open
I back out my garage wit, new Ferrari
Cause I been pimpin this game since Atari
You hardly, ever see me loving a hoe
I tell a bitch, I'm in love wit my doe
Cause I'm pimping and, niggas is bitchin and
We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions
Think I'm slippin, like I don't grip again
Go 'head trip it ain't nothing to drop a clip again
Got my dawgs to catch me when I'm fallin

You see I'm vest up, I'm ballin at war
These niggas wanna see me off, they don't wanna see me on but
Proof I'm ballin; I put a eighth
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life
And you youngn's in the hood wanna be like P
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit
You know how dudes ""This Proof ain't for that bullshit""

We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)

When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin like weight
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin my point
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game

Quick-tempered, short-fused, and pissed at God
Demons pullin at my soul 'til it's ripped apart
Secret's out momma that fire I started it
Fuck the fireman logic of the closet by the wire shit
What's positive about a father that bust nuts then wussed up
And a momma that don't show her son enough love
Shit, that's why I run from my first son
And force these chickenhead bitches to get abortions
I'm married to game, my mistress is fame
My girl Paq the closest, she know I ain't gon' change
Go insane in a world evil as ours

Gotta face the fact though I can't fool this mirror
Neglected my daughter and tryin to blame on how I was brought up
like I'm a product of this environment, why ain't I shot up?
Got up today like ""Why you let me breathe again?""
And with each breath I feel death is creepin in
Thinkin sinners are winners and I'ma finish last
My pen and pad record my life as each minute pass
Passin minutes, I shook sin and shook drugs
I did right by you but still you took Bugz
Then caught me in adultery, fought me

Kid outta wedlock so my lady's frontin
I love Em, cause he gave me somethin
A positive anything is better than a negative nothin
I was on the edge of death ready to jump in
It's hard when you can't find love anywhere
And just because the reverend listen, don't mean he care
Pops on crack with a sufferin past
I dream in black and white, the world color me bad
Other than sad, painful and stress

Hey Pastor you know it's hard for me when you quote Puritans
Oh, the precious Puritans
Have you not noticed our facial expressions?
One of bewilderment, and heartbreak, like ""Not you too, Pastor""
You know they were chaplains on slave ships, right?
Would you quote Columbus to Cherokees?
Would you quote Cortez to Aztecs, even if they theology was good?
It just sings a blind privilege, wouldn't you agree?
Your precious Puritans

They looked my onyx and bronze skinned forefathers in they face
Their polytheistic, God-hating face
Their shackled, diseased, imprisoned, face
And taught a Gospel that said that God had multiple images in mind when He created us in it
Therefore destined salvation contains a contentment
In the stage for which they were given
Which is to be owned by your forefather's superior, image bearing face
Says your precious Puritans

And my anger towards this teaching screams of an immature doctrine
And a misunderstanding of the Gospel
I should be content in this stage, right?
Isn't that what Paul taught, according to your precious Puritans?

Oh you get it, but you don't get it
Oh that we can go back to an America that once were
Founded on Christian values
They don't build preachers like they used to
Oh the richness of their revelation
It must be nice to not have to consider race
It must be nice to have time to contemplate the stars
Pastor, your color-less rhetoric is a cop out
You see my skin, and I see yours
And they are beautiful, fearfully and wonderfully, divinely designed
Uniqueness
Shouldn't we celebrate that rather than act like it ain't there?
I get it
Your Puritans got it, but

How come the things the Holy Spirit showed them
In the Valley of Vision
Didn't compel them to knock on they neighbor's door
And say ""you can't own people!""
Your precious puritans were not perfect
You romanticize them as if they were inerrant
As if the skeletons in they closet was pardoned due to they hard work and tobacco growth
As if abolitionists were not racists and just pro-union
As if God only spoke to white boys with epic beards
You know Jesus didn't really look like them paintings
That was just Michaelangelo's boyfriend
Your precious Puritans

Oh they got it but they don't get it
There's not one generation of believers 
That has figured out the marriage between proper doctrine and action
Don't pedestal these people
Your precious Puritan's partners purchased people
Why would you quote them?

Step away
Think of the congregation that quotes you
Are you inerrant?
Trust me, I know the feeling
Same feeling I get when people quote me like if they only knew
See I get it, but I don't get it, huh
Ask my wife

And it bothers me when you quote Puritans, if I'm honest
For the same reason it bothers me when people quote me

Step to the front if you wanna see the action
Glance at the mic should I rock my style?
It's been a long time since I got buck wild

Sometimes I feel lost in the sauce
When it comes down to who's the boss, am I being too soft?
Feenin' for your love and your special attention
Trying to get you to look in my direction

Eh you 'bout straight, put a cake in your oven
Got to see me to get the good lovin'
Wanna get the chance to sex and romance ya
On the dance floor, yeah you want more

I'm wit your girlfriends on the weekend
I give you all types of freakin' now you tell me you're leavin'
Girl get a grip 'cause I'm hittin' all angles
You know how the game goes, you gon' feel shameful

Spotlight game tight every night new sights
Who would ever think life could be so nice
Everything's love til you find out the price
You're saying you're sick of the same routine

Can't separate life from a floor style dream
You wanna take a look split from the scenes
When you thought you got a grip it's true you lost steam
Kick start strain but you can't find step

In your place is a stud with a bit more pep
Little less rep secret well kept
Aid her when you need every night you slept
Heard it all before can't believe it came true

Hard to see what a good party'll do
What ya gon' do? Listen to your crew
Shoulda took a better look
At who's sleeping with you

When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

Every time I turn around you're lookin' for somethin' new
Talkin' 'bout who got to find something else to do
Who you wit' and what you want is just a fantasy
That's why I keep tellin' you your ass need to be with me

You know what I'm sayin'
That's what you want

Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that want to get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't want to sit down, I just want to get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quite
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl that's irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Vosties per Monte
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill

Ain't a hater alive that could hold us down

You ask us can you get some, homey you must be crazy

So you can leave in your 64 rag not a body bag

So don't slip 'cause if you do I got a grip on

Ruin your hair, I'd rather put it away and cruise off in my Chevrolet

Prophet Jones,"Been in love many times before,
But it didn't work out right.
This love for you I can't ignore,
I tried to run but I just can't hide no no
Girl, I put my trust in you,
I'm not afraid of what my boys might say
Because I know that my love is real
All I'm asking for is

A lifetime is all that I need
I'm ready to settle down and give you all of me.
A lifetime is all that I need
Don't ever take your love away
I'll be here always.

I never thought I'd feel this way,
I was always a playa going hard,
So many girls, so many games
I left a trail of broken hearts.
But somehow you came along,
Came along and set my soul on fire,
And ever since that day
My life hasn't been the same

A lifetime is all that I need
I'm ready to settle down and give you all of me.
A lifetime is all that I need
Don't ever take your love away
I'll be here always.

I never thought I'd fall so deep
The thought of your love, it makes me weak
You came along and turn my life around

Six months or so
It's been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain't nothing without
Communication
How we were lying in the bed
The both of us looking at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open, about 3 in the morning
I said, ""Baby, we can't go on this way""
She said, ""you're right""
I said, ""I know you love me and I love you too""

Straight from the north side of town with the gangsta frown
Evergreen niggas brought the clown cause we bull n shit
With the prophet posse and the whole fuckin triple six

If you bigger, you gonna fall, or try to crawl
Then I ball on your face, with chrome rims, or black walls
Late at night, I'm super tight, stay out of sight
With a scope pointed at a car, with blue lights (blue lights)
You know what I mean, with the stripes run up on ya, like OJ Simpson
With a knife, on your wife, or your kids

Propoganda,"[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects of depravity like gang bangin' and earthquakes.
Most famous no namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of kings. I know it's a strange concept.
Pedalin' redemption boy what more can I say make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since ninety three.
Fillin' these 58′s with phrases that would deem us unfit to succeed among these heathens.
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible that you would understand that stage like your morning candle.
It's handin' out cancer that's why fame was never the aim and the back is the front – homie left side up!
That's a concept

Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losin' my cool...
It's what your frame of mind has chosen.
I'll leave your brain stimulated...

[Verse 2: Braille]
So many mis... conceptions- missin' the mark- mis-directed- drivin' reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions- our methods need corrections-
Spittin venom in their face and violate the ones we should protect it's an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused – view leadership as illegitimate so they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothin' more than a power-trip – they don't want to be plugged into it
They'd rather see that power stripped – get it? Power strip... It's unfortunate
Disproportionate the door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow left to our demise actin' foolish but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction of service and submission – within a leadership position

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right? Like your the type that believes that if you act right then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person, you followed the good book as much as you could, you probably didn't go to church as much as you should, but it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody, never really steal from anybody, you never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies.
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor, you try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval with the removal of sinful discretions – your righteous acts of removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception...

[Verse 4: Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection - and the greatest misconception the world believes the Christian is foolish without direction.
And they knock it they knock it but what does it profit a prophet to be socially ostracizing no we ain't stoppin' the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market for a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue in cheek, this is what I mean, they don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though. They just know the pseudo, the fake faith, the false one, the western God that's man made, not the Biblical Awesome

Prospect,"Since day one  niggaz died at the Don 
'Cause I was anon  now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond 
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated 
Quadriplegic any squad that want to squab when I'm heated 
Not even God can believe it  the way we regulate 
And levitate  heavyweight niggaz like they was featherweight 
Every day I do the same thang 
It's the paid game, to amputate more body parts than gangrene 

Yo this a man's game, it's a shame how niggaz truly mock me 
But who can stop me, from breakin' niggaz off like Fujiyaki? 
My crew's probably the only niggaz that really live the lyrics 
Niggaz really fear us, they must of heard we really killers 
We're Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters 
And army cutters Willie niggaz that laundry dollars 
I'm Nostradamus predictin the future, my position is crucial 
With a known friction obsession addiction to shoot ya

Hey yo I'm better off dead than givin' the feds the satisfaction 
Subtractin' my freedom have me missin' in action 

A fraction of y'all, raw like Colt to the jaw 
The rest of y'all, fear war, and couldn't follow out the protocol 

Joe the God is like the angel of death, strangle your neck 
That's why Don Cartagena's the name your respect 

I bring the pain to your chest, that'll make you question your threshold 
Flex like you been forced, still ""bless you"" like a chest cold 
We destined to explode, that's why I stay on flip mode 
Your dick rode me long enough Dunn, now you can let go 

[Chorus: x2]
Every man in this world has a destiny 
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me; unless you just 
Def dumb and blind you know the pedigree 
Better get ready because I'm veddy and there ain't no gettin' rid of me 

Uh, uh, uh, yo! 
Somebody hold me back, Joey Crack's about to load the gat 
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac 
Hold me back this max n better, out for the ass n cheddar 
But fast cash don't last forever 

I asked the felons, if I don't stay wrapped in leathers 
And hats with feathers, I got all the ostriches actin jealous 
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras 
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompson's, flown back from Paris 

Dat dats the illest, these body tracks make a rap killings 
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings 
My destiny was to shine, ? to climb 
Especially in time, with the recipe in mind 
From the jump start, they ain't have to pump hard in this 
I was a part of this, and marvelous stats, it wasn't hard to miss 
And yo, I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue 
Whose on my menu? A record deal they couldn't lend you 
I had to burn my glock and earn my spot 
The time flew by, had to turn my clock 
And start with a new resume, not really that bitch named Des'ree 
She ain't really my dream there's a better way what? 
Prospect'll have to collect dough 
Dialin 905 to L-A-X with somethin' I was tryin' to drive 
A life that's trife for what I wore in the fuckin' ? 
A thug in pain, I swear to my little cousin's grave

No mean to disrespect but a lot of y'alls frontin'
Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas
Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas
We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name
Throwin' blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin' to get stocked
Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block

It's like the rap games far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lane, how come? They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin' to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin' VSOP tearin' my liver
Livin' my life like I don't care I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin' I'ma make it home

The streets is funny peeps'll kill you
Over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin'
And don't keep it gully, I'm from the Bronx
Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin' that you comprehend this

Its the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
Its the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on strangers

Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up like ""Yo, why me?""

I never really had a pops
But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the streets my name
And heat's my game, 'cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the cast, you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap at you though

You for real here, niggas be followin' with steps
I made my own moves, so the tokers, could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you once considered a friend

Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin' to scare society
But can't slip again 'cause my lil' man relyin' me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin' to climb hills
And tryin' to make me kill for less

Yo its the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo its the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up
Like yo, why me?

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work

I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chaser
It ain't safe here, the bright lights cablide you
Mix sedica, swallow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin' these streets

I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin' they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin' to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin' for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin' from nothin'
Comin' from nothin', makes you struggle harder for somethin'
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin'

The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, don't make me have to spray ya

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'

[Fat Joe]
Yo, uh, yo, call me the JV artist
That means I own two joint ventures and two different labels, niggas that pay me homage
Been in this game for nine seasons
That's nine reasons why I'm expired the rhyme beefin
Ya'll niggas is rappin ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin with your moms (livin with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin, burst a flame in your face, motherfucker

Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God

And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef

My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, ya'll know what this is

Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a are a, a are a, O, are Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

[Verse 2-Prospect]
Yo, I squeeze of gats and spit facts when I breath on tracks
Got that hot shit, that make you ease on back
I'll make you leave the game like Ma$e, and get ya name erased
Walk threw from place to place, and change the chase
I'm givin him terror, for the new millennium era
Automatic Semi's wit the fully clip and the leather
Poppin champagne like we celebrating whatever
Switch to the chin, shoot top, hair and a feather
Versatile, walking threw the aisle, hurtin the crowd
Even got the god in the cloud, observing this style
He love the way I do this, leavin nigga's clueless
It's Prospect, it's off wit ya head, you should've knew this
My twin??, cock and squeeze, we stoppin G's
You better follow up, these nigga's can't rock wit these
Straight up, I speak life threw the mic though
Sprayin the town, and layin it down like whoa!

[Verse 3-Fat Joe]
Yo, ayo I'm lookin for the perfect mami to ride wit me
Only wear she like to rock is 560
Swear to her mom's if it's on, she'll die wit me
Puff blunts, like to get high just like Whitney
Thug type, ""Set It Off"", like Jada
And this chick go both ways, don't hate her
Back in the block, they use to try to play her
Till the Don out her to the qualities much greater
Net Worth, put the tool in the skirt
Which you fools know about gettin head in reverse
About, clockin grips, and coppin whips
You muthafucker's stay frontin, stop poppin shit
Let's not forget, who be gettin robbed wit the choker
Man, I'm still rockin my same chains from ""Flow Joe""
And you know Joe stay wit tha mack
You hatin the fact, you can't do nathan to crack
YA HEARD!!!

Prospect Park,"Yeah, uh, dat gangsta shit!
Shout to my homies out west hoo-bangers!
Mack Deezy for Sheezy
All my niggas in the Bronx
Holdin' them corners down
Ya heard? Get it right!

Joe cracks back, been a long time comin'
No mean to disrespect but a lot of y'alls frontin'
Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas
Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas
We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name
Throwin' blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin' to get stocked
Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block

It's like the rap games far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lane, how come? They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin' to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin' VSOP tearin' my liver
Livin' my life like I don't care I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin' I'ma make it home

The streets is funny peeps'll kill you
Over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin'
And don't keep it gully, I'm from the Bronx
Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin' that you comprehend this

Its the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
Its the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on strangers

Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up like ""Yo, why me?""

I never really had a pops
But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the streets my name
And heat's my game, 'cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the cast, you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap at you though

You for real here, niggas be followin' with steps
I made my own moves, so the tokers, could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you once considered a friend

Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin' to scare society
But can't slip again 'cause my lil' man relyin' me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin' to climb hills
And tryin' to make me kill for less

Yo its the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo its the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up
Like yo, why me?

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work

I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chaser
It ain't safe here, the bright lights cablide you
Mix sedica, swallow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin' these streets

I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin' they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin' to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin' for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin' from nothin'
Comin' from nothin', makes you struggle harder for somethin'
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin'

The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, don't make me have to spray ya

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work

Yo (feedin you, feedin you)

[Fat Joe]
Yo, uh, yo, call me the JV artist
That means I own two joint ventures and two different labels, niggas that pay me homage
Been in this game for nine seasons
That's nine reasons why I'm expired the rhyme beefin
Ya'll niggas is rappin ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin with your moms (livin with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin, burst a flame in your face, motherfucker

[Armageddon]
Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God
Cause even though you never seen me, I been put fear in your hearts
And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef

[Prospect]
My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, ya'll know what this is

[Remy Martin]
Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a are a, a are a, O, are Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

How many a ya'll niggas is loyal?
All these Benedict Arnold niggas
Switch sidin niggas, ya heard?

Going to court got a illuminati judgin' me biased
Shit, I talkin' for everybody, walkin' united
The way I walk, it's a challenge just to balance on wires
My old connect put me on said he robbed the supplier
So I pieced him out with pity 'coz his ass was on fire

What goes around comes around holmes I ain't lyin'
That's why the scars on my face 'coz bad karma and violence
Just before a nigga wake I spend the night in silence
To give my nerves a little break before it's back to the malice
I'd like to dedicate this rhyme to old emotional scars
Some nights I meditate hopin' bring me closer to God
Tryin' to regulate my time between the Earth and the stars
Get my health back to determine when I curlin' them bars

Smokin' weed, eatin' curry chicken like the Robsters
After that go to city, Allen and get the lobsters

Now can I get a witness lemme show y'all my visions
Never had a job but still takin' all my business
No G.E.D only the promo what's my lyrics
I rhyme heavenly and let soldiers off the appearance
And rap so I keep my dough stacks don't me go back

It's been a long time man
Y'all niggaz think this shit is easy
Niggaz struggle for this shit right here man
Listen to this man

[Prospect Park]
Aye yo, they got me poisoned like ivy
Y'all been waiting for them boys to come try me
Quick on the draw, fast on the finger like Mike Lowrey
Niggaz funny, first they get your numbers
Then want to shout you
See you getting money
Now they want the guns to come out you
Well you see we all be having dreams about them cars and floors
With some of ? ? marry you, the call is yours
I was determined
My niggaz out will burn and chew you
Spit you out, like a shot from a German luger
Now who want it, test my peoples I'll blast the boy
Pull out them twin desert eagles, like I'm Pastor Troy
Man I've been through some rough winters
And plush like four summers
But I've made it over them rough roads like old hummers
Look I'm a, made man crook
Now see me in ?
But I'mma go this way and write rhymes in your Shakespeare book
Niggaz be scared to death, I can see in the face they shook
And they ain't want give me a shot, I had to make them look
It's Prosp'

Aye yo, they say the ? for this music I was cutting my classes
Stood up late night, a stanky nigga bustin my ass
Now my memory cake, and y'all niggaz cake is telling ain't me shitty
Y'all stressing misdemeanors, man I catch a felony quickly
Shit I deserved what I got
And yo them forms they be copyin
You tried to swerve in my spot
Go earn a war on your block
I just came to lay my name down, I work a hard shift
Show my talents to the world and expose my god gift
I was grown with hard end, many obstacles and fights
But I learned to heal my scars, like them doctors doing life
Keep it moving, cruising
Doing like a hundred and sixty
And I ain't stopping till them motherfucking cops come and get me
I survived my community
Took my opportunity
To get money and y'all mad cause I'm doing me (cut it out man)
I'm going south and I'm fishing
Stop that mouthing and bitching
Put your money on the table, I'll put you out of commission

Protest the Hero,"We woke up as men but tonight we'll sleep as killers
As we break the cryptic morning with a bullet and a prayer
The steel never seemed more cold and agile than now
And life never seems less vital and fragile

With a heart that's beating louder than my own
I watch a woman they call Kezia
I watch a woman that I know
I watch my hopes and my own future blindfolded
To atone for a sin I didn't care for, but a sin that paid my debts
A sin that fed my children and burned my smiles and cigarettes

And no one ever said that hope would be so beautiful
And no one ever said I'd have to pull the trigger on her

I can't even still her trembling hands that were locked up by the dutiful and obligated;

Five soldiers forever sedated with the,
""No one's responsible"" psychological drama of our social justice dribble
Her tiny steps tell lies about the choice I have to make;
Resurrect a static lifetime starve to death my own mistakes
Pull the screaming trigger and watch your carcass bleed me dry
Or drop the gun and try to shake away the blindfold from your eyes?

Drop the gun Drop the gun
Drop the gun Drop the gun

A sin I didn't care for, but a sin that paid my debts
A sin that fed my children and burned my smiles and cigarettes

Protest the Hero,"Place your justice in my palm and then I'll make fist
Punch your grimaced face until every last knuckle breaks
And bleeds in resistance to my sidewalk painting
A mangled body twitching and regaining consciousness and closure
Attempting composure before a bullet in the mouth answers the questions of exposure
And God of Sunday School façades and paycheques to validate the time I served abroad
It all means nothing if I forget why I'm here
To serve and protect my fist over fist mind under matter career
That's why a man sounds kind of funny when he falls to his knees
With his hand on his throat while he begs you to please spare his life
While I explain the hardest of bodies dulls the softest of knives
Then I hold up his chin and carve X's in his eyes
I swear I have compassion I've just been trained to disregard the prisoner's life
Because I am the prison guard",Bury the Hatchet,2006
Protest the Hero,"Better think of my answers now because I know the questions with be asked
Like if I brought the joy I found in the confessions of a mask
The tip of my tongue's already touching the top of my mouth
It's meaning manifest in mercy burning down the house
It's true that tactless teem totem-poles turn tolerance to tired taboos
It's true that a bullet never knocks on the door, it's about to come crashing through
Walking one last mile in big steps as your alter-wine
Doing it in tattered shoes that aren't even mine
Because my own are in a box locked up with possessions I can't have
Like the gunman with his future and the prison priest's golden calf

Blindfolds aside I'd probably still close my eyes
And try to feel a trembling fetal life inside that shotgun barrel that's about to make me bleed
Like an ulcer in the stomach of the beast
Like a little girl on a bed that was years ago deceased

Protest the Hero,"Allow me a moment to explain
While you were sleeping the ocean wasn't drained
But transformed

It yawned and groaned as it rose from its bed
It stretched; diluted and extended its head
And took corporeal form

At least in part at first
But when it encountered the Earth
It took a deep draw in, extended its arms, and leapt into the sky

It took wing over mountain and rode on the wind
It traveled the cities but as the sun dimmed
It grew fat and it cursed at the earth

In a thunderous rage
And a display of bright lights
It spat and began to give birth

The bloom is off the rose, at least for me
Dogs like me can bark, but the caravan moves on

When you finally awoke, a new ocean had formed
Through the clamorous night, through the magnificent storm
It fell from the sky to reform and preform
Its endless endeavor in its worn uniform

The Sun, the Moon, the Earth, and the shore
Tired metaphors played out before your eyes
Sedation, satisfaction

But to be satisfied and entertained
Without any source of intellectual gain
Seems to be what's in fashion

Interpret the meaning
To mean whatever you want it to be
I've heard these same words fall from my own lips
It falls flat and I question its value
It falls flat and I question its worth

In a thunderous rage
And a display of bright lights
It spat and began to give birth

The bloom is off the rose, at least for me
Dogs like me can bark, but the caravan moves on

Better to light a candle than curse at the darkness

This is the confluence of narrative and naivety
Swallowing a stream of lies and empty poetry
You don't have to be the one to tell me
You don't have to be the one to let me down

A catchy way of saying nothing
But a narrative seems to allude to something more
With a purpose and a real direction
But they're just words punched in a template
The same mistakes we made before

I, for one, am fucking tired
Of conceptions that bring nothing new from the womb
But if every story is the same
Then the rose has truly lost its bloom

Can you sing it back to me?

I can't relate to this
I can't relate
Maybe it's your preference
But I can't relate

""Where is the problem? We're entertained.""
My problem's the consistency with every concept made
Don't just tell me a story
What does it convey?

""Where is the problem? We're entertained.""
I want to feel something more than just betrayed
You are the problem
I am the problem

Are you satisfied?
Don't be satisfied",Caravan,2016
Protest the Hero,"Death is callous, strange and sudden 
A pious, indignant, drooling glutton 
Whose hands are soft, warm, inviting 
Whose desperate advances seem useless fighting 
Whose ragged tooth should rip through flesh 
Which marinates in rancid breath 
How quick one turns to a violent death 
When cowardice remains where courage left 
No guiding light to lead the way 
Just rot declining to decay 

The would-be hangman hangs its head 
To find its victim not quite dead 
But rising now from beneath the gallows 
A driving force cuts through the shadows 

Strike from the heart, cut to the quick 
With no remorse it’s politic 
With crippling blows to the body and head 
Drip by drip until it’s finally bled out 

One moment defines a lifetime 
No one recalls the crawl or the climb 
Or the trembling legs that take the first two steps 
Or the moment the lungs decide to take breath 

The darkness comes to life 
Underneath its cloak beat the blood red eyes 
Whose haunting stare leaves one paralyzed 

This is the nightmare from which one never awakes 
Laughing at the feeble whose whole body shakes 
Who pounce upon the weakness and the past mistakes 
Whose hands grip the heart and cause the heartbreak 
So strike from the heart, cut to core 
Leave only the sinew washed up on the shore 
Sever the head of the beast with the crown 
Never back down 
(Back down) 
Never back down 

And as the light breaks through the darkest night 
It finds the victor dressed in white 
Rising now from beneath the gallows 
A driving force cuts through the shadows",Cataract,2016
Protest the Hero,"Twisting through contorted limb 
Sober now from distant whim 
Batten down the hatches 
The storm approaches, the thunder crashes 
It cannot wait 
It must be now 
A shot’s been fired across the bow 
What presence here has been proclaimed? 
What once was unspoken is finally named 

So this is sinking, or so it seems 
Diving fathoms in lucid dreams 
With lungs now aching, begging for air 
And only cold water answers 
With a cinder block anchor, hope turns to despair 
Ripped from the womb and left to the ocean’s care 
Cold water 

So just sink, let go, slip into the depths 
Let the pieces of a wasted life slip past the fingertips 
Rejoice, exult, a fitting conclusion to a melancholy myth 
A grave at sea, an absentee, whose presence won’t be missed 

Picking at the bones that came to rest on the ocean bed 
Whose subtle pose tells a tale of those that sink like lead 
Summon the ire left hanging in moments that swings by the neck to and fro. 
Assured by the light that there’s one way to go

Protest the Hero,"Sleep still and silent
Dream in stained glass scenes of violence
Claim the song sung by the sirens
Breathe shallow and quietly

Stand before the corpse of the crow
They'll call themselves hero
Take up the blade, the blade that struck the final blow
Tear off the wings to refuse its ascension
There will be no reproach. There will be no reproach. There will be no redemption
For the wicked and corrupt at the end of its life
Only justice from the absolute with a flick of a knife
Wicked and corrupt at the end of its life
Only justice from the absolute with a flick of a knife

Back to where it all began
Tracing footprints to the shore
They lead into the ocean
Where the horror waits no more
In its place waits utter devotion
The current casting backward tells a tale of lifetime past
The empty faces that once seemed listless have all now been recast
But when lost in distant thoughts, a sleeping evil starts to stir
Distracted by warm memories with vigilance relaxed
It seemed unlikely to occur

Tear off the wings to refuse its ascension
There will be no reproach. There will be no reproach. There will be no redemption

Tracing footprints to the shore
They lead into the ocean
Where the horror waits no more
In its place waits utter devotion

A breach in the bow would allow the craft to sink again
Reaching down to tear the wings from the crow conquered in complete

Experience a transformation both of body and of mind
Rearrange the constellations and define the undefined

The returned speaks in tongues once bewildering
But in its hands sit the wings and the dagger that say everything
Without a word it says everything

Tore off the wings to refuse its ascension
There will be no second coming
No forces for succumbing to
Just a peaceful place to final rest a head
The crow is dead

Protest the Hero,"What unknown face now breaks the silence? 
What tipping force disturbs the balance? 
Swift and sober, comes a voice, offering a bitter choice 
Take up a crime and serve the sentence, offer up a final penance 
Or dismantle colossus from deep inside, conspirators, 
and those allied 
Gifts of bronze, iron, obsidian, from nave to chop, 
plunged and hidden 
Deep in the chests of those who cry, the songs of gods untrue 
The prayers to start or end the coup, forever silenced 

Like sulfur set to fire, blue flame is born 
To rip through homes and cleanse the town 
A new world rendered, an old world mourned 
The old world left to drown 
It draws closer with every step, push off with both feet 
Fall into the chasm, which will consume all 
March not to the drum, but off the beat 
Burst into the evening, cool air burns the lungs 
Fear not the turning heads, the darting glances, the lashing tongues 

The glowing eyes that burn like embers, fall painful on the skin 
Seething with hatred, and writhing in pain, they cast a ghastly grin 
Yet among the faces shrouded in horror, one truth prevails 
All who’ve ever come this far exclusively have failed 
Reach for the hand whose grasp is firm, 
Whose blistered palms can confirm, 
A kinship in a spiteful place, 
with tender touch a warm embrace

Desperate for something more 
Something more than getting by 
Empty faces on the sidewalk, 
Listless and limping to a lie,

Of a blue and cloudless sky 
A phantom whisper sounds deceiving 
It brings with it the question “why?” 
We work until we are unable, 
Then locked away until we die 

But then it happened 
Everything changed in but an instant 
A violent burst of brilliant colour, 
somehow close and somehow distant 
From a whisper, 
to a scream, 
to a hoarse, distorted laugh 
There is no hope of restitution 
There is no ever going back 

In dreamless sleep, 
one ponders death 
Hold back the fleeting final breath 
Knuckle white, slipping grip, 
jaw clenched tight, and quivering lip

La miré con ganas con esa carita de fama
Ella miró oh si! ella pasó oh no!
Ella se volvió con una sonrisa
Tengo que bailar con esa muñequita
La invité y puso brinca
Y enseguida quise jalarla pa' la pista
Y cuando llegué ay
Llegó el tiburón y con el se me fué
Ahí esta el tiburón
Ahí esta el tiburón
Se la llevo el tiburón, el tiburón, el tiburón
Ahí esta el tiburón

Se la llevo el tiburón, el tiburón
No pares, sigue, sigue, no pares, sigue, sigue
No pares, sigue, sigue, no pares, sigue, sigue

No pares, sigue, sigue, no pares, sigue, sigue

Okay, tanto, encontré otra chica que estaba mejor
Bailamos tres merengues de corrido y gozamos
Luego nos sentamos, ordenamos bebidas y conversamos
She look good, so of course I lied all my girls from the hood
Ella preguntó si tenía novia y yo dije no
Me quité el anillo, despacito me lo metí en el bolsillo
Vino un descarado y me dijo ¿tú no eres casado?
Me quedé pasmado y enseguida se la llevó de mi lado
Oh my god ese tiburón
Yo pensé que tú sabías que es proyecto uno!
Dela uh!
Ahí esta el tiburón

Prozak,"When you see my smilin', I'm really frownin'
You think you're really wildin'? I'm killa clownin'
Meaning I don't give a fuck about nothing you say that you do
Because stupid is how everybody sounded
Nigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me
Homie, you would leave me by my lonely
I'm thinking death and destruction
Images of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging
(That's just the devil, just the devil)
Block it out and keep it moving
I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the Bible, yes I need it 'cause Tecca Nina's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin' up when really I don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall
The taste of blood on my tongue makin' me want to brawl
No sentimental shit, death is the penalty
For any bitch you try to re-kindle this
It'll get your temple hit
'Bout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get
Send it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter totter mothafucka if you want it
But just keep it to the left of me, crazy 'til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Half and hell of drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee
Shit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me
Bitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin' the sex with me
I'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
'Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)
And I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it
One of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin' like a Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking 'bout
You don't want it with me

Betta load up your drums
Load up your guns
Everybody better get to runnin'
You don't want it with me
I'm a lyrical cynical rippin' ya pinnacle
Damage anybody when I see they really want it with me
Techa-ninna told me nigga get money
And never been dumby
Shit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me
Follow the beat follow your feet
Gimme the weed keys G's
And a quarter pound of bullets with a machete
Mister Reese known for getting it poppin'
You niggas be droppin'
And when you do your albums be floppin'
When ever I spit it
Man better yet when ever I drop it
Your wifies gone cop it
She even tell you nigga go cop it
You don't want it with me
I'll fuck your life up like a disease
I'm hauntin' your dreams
With a fully auto choppa them beams

I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin' like a Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking 'bout
You don't want it with me

And you don't want it from me
See I'm believing that people are really angels and demons
Instead of human beings
I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding
Causin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles
Keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows
As I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run
I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony
Oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
The Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
'Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)

You're flying away
Like the last days of the motherfuckin loafers
I'm the redneck in the moshpit
2 axes come in handy
To answer Violent J, ya damn right its a stanley
In the shadows of the dark with darkman like spawn
In the dash blazin it up with explosive bombs
I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM
While zipping bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM
Ice mixed with blood is the killers milkshake
Here with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathbreak

[Chorus]

Disrespect me I'll run in your house
Like puffin steam stout
Break both your arms, gun in your mouth
Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth
Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die swift
Fuckin wit tha clan, watch what you say
We kill *Beep: Lame Lyric Censor*
Shoot you with an SK or a AK bitch you gonna die either way
I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head
Cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead
Catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo
I'm a Sing-Sing killer
Gun groove captain
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping
Gats get brung, niggas get done
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons
I'm a killer

[Chorus]

To die is a fate that must come to us all
But how horrible to be buried alive
From the darkness they shuffle eyes glazed with death
Hands clawing for blood!

These are the Street Scriptures for all my riders, niggas, and hoes
Let me ask you a question,
Why give a bitch fame by sayin' his name?
When all I gotta say is you's a bitch
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you nigga
You ain't no killa, on the riz-illa
So High Beam my nigga, get with 'em

Hold my sixth sense up and ask buddy why

Could somebody, anybody tell me why-ay

Probably givin' somethin' to fools cause the man in need

I can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994
And a group of us was chilling at the table
We was drinking with our fingers on the ouija board
Tryna summon spirits asking ""ouija, can you hear us?""
Never thinking what was in store
Then the dogs started barking, in the darkness
All of a sudden it was knocking at the front door
Then we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open
Nervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion
No one was there, we went back to the board hoping
That we finally made contact, with the deity
Apparition on the other side
Then it started moving out and soon it was
Spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die
We decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment
On the way home sarah hit a patch of ice
Lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life

On this dying Earth we're in

My taste carrier seeks the blood of an angel, how can I mangle?

Yates buried her deep, I don't wanna eye everything, die like the great barrier reef!
It's a bad moon, mad gloom, giving stab wounds
Sucking a soul up like a vacuum
Monkey, apes, and baboons in the classroom
Wanting to be upper class and cash coons, mass doom
Then I woke up, choked up
Glad it was a dream and now I wanna go pick a lotus
But the grass is low cut, no fluff
Wish I could say hocus pocus
With the bees and pollen in focus
So the food we need isn't bogus
Fake feedings, race leading to death
Everybody's race leading great eating's for breath

Multiple personalities adamantly ferocious
At first in agony, anger to cope a closed fist
And run a sign of caution if you try to approach bitch

Tell me why am I thinking these thoughts
Skin burning at the sign of a cross
Somebody help me I think that I'm lost
Edge of insanity I have been tossed
Mayday, got a man down, better pray for safe space now
Stay away or become prey when I rampage and I spray rounds
Pharmaceutical holocaust, a little bit lyrical Molotov
Serial killer like Michael with a knife and the rifle I'm psyched and I'm popping off
So let me say this, you don't wanna say shit
End up another screaming victim on my playlist

And time has beat us
Seems I've forgotten who to be
You took the better part of me
My heart, my soul, my sweetest memories

Boxes line our hallway
Where laughter used to be
Empty house surrounds me
And echos our history

To find a way
To bring us back to yesterday
My love, my life, my childhood fantasy
Still everything to me

Almost seeing 
You pull in the driveway

We talked a while and then made plans 
While all the children laughed at me and you

Much before either of us knew

Walked together hand in hand

mornings turned to afternoons 
And dinners turned to making love

Wie aus heiterem Himmel fällt ein Scheiß-Schrei in der Stille
Ich stecke so tief in der Scheiße, bekomme die Beine nicht raus
Ich lege mir noch ein paar Scheine zur Seite, dann steig ich aus
Easy DC, Eko Freezy, Psaiko.Dino, #hangster
Ich bin ein echter Gangster, nur strapped mit der Beretta
Kicke den Gangster-Shritt, auch wenn ich hinterm Lenkrad sitz
Der Cadillac wippt, doch ich treffe gezielt aus dem verfickten Fensterschlitz

Ein Gangster und ein Hipster, Welten prallen aufeinander
Landen über dem Tellerrand und Rahmen fallen auseinander
Ein Gangster und ein Hipster, Gegensätze ziehen sich an
Sieh uns an, jeder ist auf dieses Feature gespannt

Ein Gangster und ein Hipster, Welten prallen aufeinander

Ey, Eko, ich hab grad unseren Song gehört,
Warum hast du jetzt 'nen Gangster-Part gemacht?
Wie? Was meinst du jetzt?
Ja, das Konzept war doch ein Gangster und ein Hipster, oder?
Ja, aber ich bin doch kein Hipster!
Ich bin auch kein Hipster.
Ich hab gedacht, wenn von uns beiden einer ein Hipster ist, dann du
Nenene, ich hab gedacht, du bist der Hipster,
Also, ich bin auf keinen Fall 'n Hipster
Und ich bin erst recht kein Hipster, ich bin ganz normaler Gangsta
Ja, ich auch, Alta. Egal, Westside!",#hangster,2014
Psaiko.Dino,"Yeah, aha

Yo, uh eh

Ich bin wieder irgendwo, aber nicht daheim
(Jap) Egal, wo ich bin, werd ich nicht lange sein
Noch 3 Stunden fahr'n, jap, bis wir da sind
Mach mal relaxt, man du musst nicht so rasen
Lehn' dich zurück, alles cool, wenn wir harzen
Fenster nicht auf, es ist drin, du musst atmen
3-Meter-Spliff, wir rollen über Straßen
Im Anschlag ? und die Scheiben getönt, weil wir Stars sind
Jap und jeden Tag ein Trip
Hier und da ein Gig und immer wieder big
Ich bin nie allein, denn ich häng mit der Clique
Und jedes Mädchen, das ich kenn' ist 'ne Pscht
Ich komm in deine Stadt mit 8 km/h
Mach die Nacht zum Tag, denn ich mach, was ich mag
Deine Stadt ist gebannt, also mach mal Alarm
Denn ich cruise durch die City und hab Hafti am Start (yo let's go)

Ey yo, wir cruisen im Truck
Ich und meine Crew komm'n in deine Stadt
Also bleib cool, Junge, mach Platz

Ey yo, wir cruisen im Truck

Ich cruise, wie du siehst, im Audi Q7 Jeep
Richtung Stuggi zum City, nenn mich Michi zum Schumi
Brudi, Baba Hafti, ich komm an mit deiner Cousine
Sie lutscht Schwanz in der Limousine, auch wenn er nur geleast ist
Fahr durch den Kiez von Hamburg City im Lamborghini
Mintgrüner Lack, Flügeltüren hoch,
Alter, ich fliege, Habibi, Arab Boeing 747
Weil ich Risiko so liebe
Auf den Chromfelgen spiegel'n sich die Linien der Straße
Die Schlampe nimmt den Spiegel und legt Linien für die Nase
Ich roll zwar auf der Street, doch bin high wie die NASA
Der Wagen Automatik wie die Cartier, die am Arm hängt
Wir sind international unterwegs, Barbie
Heute in Miami Beach, morgen in Paris
Maserati, Bugatti, Mercedes, Ferrari
Carlo und der Babo platzen auf die Party

Vergiss mal den Sambuca, int'ressiert mich nicht die Bohne
Das Konfetti regnet auf die Leute, Feuer wie Kanonen
Vorher war Plinch noch Brownies backend in seim' Haus
Und jetzt steht er auf dem Tresen und ist unheilbar gut drauf
Ein Typ will ein Autogramm, ich geb ihm einen Stift
Und sag, Geilheit ist Steilheit in Spiegelschrift, schreib das auf
Er lässt nicht locker, fragt, was bei mir so geht
Ich sag, Alter, verkauf einfach mal 'n Braten, celebrate
2 Stunden später, ich mach grad so meine Truck-Moves

Doch heute läuft nix, meine Freundin macht mal kurz Serato aus
Mein Handy läutet, Beethovens Neunte
Oder an die Freude, verteil Wodka an die Freunde
Deine Freunde müssen draußen bleiben und von drinnen träumen
Kurzer Augenkontakt mit 'nem vollkommenen Spast
Der sich angesprochen fühlt, bist du öfter hier, Schatz?

Nachdem Mama ihn vom Kindergarten abgeholt hat
Die Klamotten, nicht sein Ernst, das ist echt zu hart
Fehlt nur noch 'ne Brille mit 'nem Sticker auf dem rechten Glas
Vielleicht bin ich zu alt oder er zu jung
Aber die Hosen sind doch viel zu eng, das ist nicht mehr gesund
Ich bin in Biggie seiner Herde, bis ich sterbe und
Da läuft bei mir dann G.O.D. Part 3 auf der Beerdigung
Jetzt pass mal auf, Kleiner
Noch so'n Produzenten-Album braucht keiner
Ich mein, sowas steht im Laden und verstaubt leider
Und wenn es jemand braucht, wird's nicht gekauft
er klaut's einfach
Da wo du wohnst, ist's bestimmt weit und breit ländlich
Sieh es ein, mein Freund, kein Schwein kennt dich

Wenn alles, was nach Punkt X kam, wird es gleich interpretiert
Schublade auf und alles rein, ein Blick genügt, du denkst, du weißt
Der Schein trügt, nicht alles, was glitzert, ist Gold, obwohl man's meint
Heut sieht es so aus, morgen anders, wir verlieren den Überblick
Mit Scheuklappen an den Augen, sehen wir nur das, was man uns sehen lässt
Und das, was wir uns denken, ist das, was wir verwenden
Sehen Großes, wo Kleines dahintersteckt, lassen uns blenden
Alles schwarz-weiß
Wir sind nicht frei, liegen in Ketten, denn uns blendet der Schein
Wir entdecken die Welt neu, doch ernten Blicke, die uns nicht versteh'n
Augen, die uns anstarr'n, sie können kein Unterschied seh'n
Die Hände gebunden, die Augen vermummt
Das Ende gefunden, die Jalousien lassen's verdunkeln
Denn wir sind kurzsichtig, vorsichtig
Mit Vorurteil'n, Azzlack, Chimp, das funktioniert doch nicht, hä?

Nenn mir den Ort, dann bring ich dich hin
Ob es die Venus oder der Mars ist, habe das Navi-Gerät gestartet
Durch die Gegend fahren am Abend mit 'nem leeren Tank, kein Schaden
Komm, wir stehlen uns kein alten, sondern ein' nigelnagelneuen Wagen, yeah
Wir cruisen durch die City und der Bass pumpt
Aus dem Auto, das Handy lautlos, lautlos
Sei kein kleiner Lauch und sei laut
Mach dein Kopf höher als er sein muss und lass dich nicht beeinflussen

Sei groß, trag den Kopf zu hoch, wenn es sein muss
Denn nichts war mal nah
Geh schon mal vor, nimm dir das, was du brauchst
Den Teufel ermorden, der Körper ist laut

Sag, willst du wirklich heim, es ist die beste Zeit
Zieh dich aus, schließ die Augen und vergiss die Zeit
Such keine Ausreden, wir steigen auf den Berg zu zweit
Lass die Ängste frei, komm, wir fliegen in ein Meer aus Wein
Psaiko.Dino begleitet uns, wir bleiben zeitlos
Der Beat nimmt uns den Sinn, sie einzukalkulier'n
Ich will nicht weg, geh nicht weg, nein, wir bleiben hier
Komm, wir bleiben hier, komm, wir bleiben hier
Steig' ein, wir geben Gas, der Pfeil vom Kompass zeigt Richtung Mars
Vorbei an der Sonne im Raumschiff, wenn der Treibstoff uns gleich ausgeht
Geh'n wir weiter nach einer Pause, treffen eigenartige Clowns auf
Dem Weg so laut, wie zehn auf, du lebst auch nur einmal

Ist keinmal
Nur wer doppelt sieht, macht zweimal
Wer nicht doppelt sieht, macht alles nur einmal
Ist keinmal
Nur wer doppelt sieht, macht es zweimal
Lass uns laut sein, auch wenn wir nur schweigen
Alles kommt nie wieder, nur die Kopfschmerzen bleiben

Sei groß, trag den Kopf zu hoch, wenn es sein muss
Denn nichts war mal nach
Geh schon mal vor, nimm dir das, was du brauchst
Den Teufel ermorden, der Körper ist laut

I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this

The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this?

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away, I should have walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet but then blow it again

I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cos I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away, I should have walked away

She made it easy, she made it feel right

Psy 4 de la Rime,"J’ai maintenu les études histoire de m’accrocher dans la vie
Avec souvent une incertitude, une camisole qui me pétrifie Vision de plaines et de dunes
Vêtu de coton et de laine
J’ai plus souvent appris à me forger durant le croissant de lune
Je vis au jour le jour, au taquet comme on l’a si bien dit
Je suis de ceux prêt à faire te-bê, faire crier jour et nuit
Après réflexion, c’est le drame car je réalise que la vie
N’est pas faite de malheurs, de gâteries, de conneries
Une larme à ceux qu'ont pas eu le temps de réagir
Se faire avoir par la vie, c’est comme prévoir son avenir
La flamme du cœur, c’est comme une drogue douce
On dit que ça tue, ça fait mal mais excitant comme voir son gosse sucer son pouce
La vie m’a appris la vie car vivre
C’est comme se rendre qu’on ne vit pas éternellement, c’est comme la fin d’un livre
J’ai appris à être bon salam aux maîtres d’école coranique
Ceux qui t’apprennent que la vie mais pas seulement en italique
Pourtant je suis qu’un pion parmi tant d’autres
On court derrière je ne sais quoi pour à la fin donner sa place à d’autres
Un pion qui a appris dans ce monde à se faire bouffer
Dans cette vie où faut apprendre à perdre pour après se relever

Pauvre de nous, on vit le siècle technologique
Y’a plus de réflexe naturel, on s’inspire plus de la logique
Les guerres inspirent à l’évolution, la femme accouche sous X
Elle sait plus c’est quoi un fils
La proie de la prison ou celle de l’anti-christ
Ou du futur soldat français qui mourra en Afrique
Mais où sommes-nous chez les civilisés ou chez les fous?
L’état te rackette, même pour enterrer ton père, tu payes son trou
Tout qui se paye, c’est ça? Y’a rien qui se donne, c’est ça?
La philosophie de la patrie, c’est ça?
Allez vous faire foutre, je vais plus payer vos amendes
Quitte à être wanted, recherché à Désertland
Par le fisc et tous ces juges pourris
Sur mes épaules Kenza et Kély mi amor, on décolle
Je sens que je déconne et je perd la forme, je pillave trop
Je suis trop bouillant pour le régime Sarko
C’est alarmant, notre passé nous rattrape à la nage
J’ai compris ça quand pour Thuram ils ont fait le cri de l’orang-outang
Je vis pleinement mon age, je vis mon temps
Apprends des petits et des grands, arabe ou Bagdad, Comores ou gitan
Sénégalais ou Turquie, des cambodgien, des arméniens
Ça, c’est Plan d’Aou city, c’est là d’où je viens
Viens nous comprendre
Tu veux nos votes sans nous entendre mais tu sais quoi de nos vies?

L’amour m’a appris la haine comme la mort nous apprend la vie
Avec de la peine voila pourquoi je peine à vivre
Je traîne mon cercueil derrière chaque sourire que je te lâche
Puis la nuit je m’endors à l’intérieur pour mieux enterrer mes clash
Noyé dans l’oasis d’un mirage
Voila pourquoi sur les plages de l’amertume t’entends mes raps dans tous les coquillages
Le pire c’est que je sais que je mourirai triste
Une cigogne a tapé à ma porte et y a laissé un panier vide
On m’a dit tu grandis, t’oublies
Moi je dis plus tu pries, tu grandis
La vie n’a pas la violence de Gandhi
Je sais que dans la douleur, je ne suis qu’un apprenti
Mais à mon age, je sens déjà que mon pouls ralenti
L’horloge tourne et mes promesses sont à la bourre
Je me paye des remords mais certaines erreurs ne font pas de ristournes
Comme Pearl Harbor, j’ai cru ne jamais être attaqué
Ça vient aussi de derrière depuis ma parano est aux aguets
Va dire à celle à qui mon cœur n’a pas voulu s’ouvrir
Qu’il s’est tellement arrêté de battre, qu’il a peur de revivre
Le bonheur des gens m’a rendu aigri, la vie m’a appris
Que même après la pluie, chez moi les arcs-en-ciel sont gris

Tu connais quoi de nos vies?
De ce qu’elle nous a appris?
De ce qui nous mets à l’abri ou en débris?
Tu connais quoi de nos vies?
Vu qu’on est richement pauvres
Les rescapés sont riches en preuves

J’espère que ce ne sera pas la dernière

Appelle-moi ""Kapo"", ""Gouffran"", ""Colo-colonel""
Un frenchie de plus à compter si le rap c’est Newcastle
Prends l’élan, tire ton coup-franc, la gloire est dans tes veines
Vas-y tente ta chance, la vie te donne des ailes
Réussir, faudra le faire, faudra prendre des risques
N’ai pas peur des K.O. car tu vas te prendre des gifles
Que ça soit clair, la vie est pleine de vices
""Être le king de ma life"", voilà ma devise
Le parcours est amer, tu perdras quelques frères
Pour espérer le paradis faut traverser l’enfer
Alors je me ballade, en étant déter, au volant de ma réussite

J’ai regardé droit devant, pris mon élan
Qu’est-ce qu’il fallait faire?
J’ai parfois touché le fond, perdu du temps
Parce que je n’ai pas su faire
Mais je suis là-là-là-là, parce qu'il fallait le faire
Un de ses premier pas, une première fois
J’espère que ce ne sera pas la dernière

Y’a que ceux qui ne font rien qui ne se trompe pas
Que ceux qui ne grimpent pas qui ne tombent pas
Pour épouser son rêve faut déjà le séduire
Aucune guerre ne se gagne sans combat
J’ai tenté ma chance dans la chanson, je l'ai
Pris en otage, j’ai eu la rançon, je l'ai
Bonjour les pauvres ils connaissent mon son, je l'ai
Quitter ma poisse sans payer d'pension, je n'ai
Plus peur aujourd’hui de prendre des risques
Car mes plus belles médailles sont mes cicatrices
Je réalise que si aujourd’hui je vie de ma musique
C’est parce que j’ai fait ce qu’il fallait faire pour devenir artiste, Zaho!

Et quand reviennent les problèmes
On sait plus comment y arriver, mais on ira quand même
Oublie ceux qui causent de la peine
Laisse ton cœur te guider, fais-le pour ceux qui t’aiment

J’ai regardé droit devant, pris mon élan
Qu’est-ce qu’il fallait faire?
J’ai parfois touché le fond, perdu du temps

Les dalmatiens que nous sommes, n'aimons pas les Cruella
Et on ne sait pas regarder dans les yeux, #AndersonPamela
Tu dis que tu veux du respect de la poésie et des roses
Un mec qui te fait un bébé, mais qu'il ait des liasses dans les poches
Un beau gosse comme Trey Songz qui te fait l'amour comme personne
Si j'ai bien compris tu veux un mec
Qui te fasse grimper le ciel comme King Kong

Psy 4 de la Rime,"Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Poto
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Essayez de trouver un équilibre au milieu de tout ce bordel
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Assumer ses choix et ses défaites
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Le king de ma life

Celui qui se contente de peu ne manque de rien
Voilà comment je mène ma vie, je combats mes faux besoins au quotidien
Ici le clinquant t'empêche de voir le bon chemin
Pour mieux le voir, c'est le cœur qu'a besoin d'un opticien
Voilà pourquoi mes vers gardent un œil sur les miens
Et qu'il y a des larmes dans le regard de mes alexandrins
Je sais pas faire semblant, le monde va mal, wake up
L'amour est cardiaque donc je rappe comme un peacemaker
Toujours humble et discret
Un vrai n'expose pas ses actes à la lumière comme un trophée
Je boxe avec les mots #SopraBomayé
Mais le rap fait pas le poids face à l'urgence de mon foyer
Le din m'a appris le love
Il m'a appris que la liberté s'arrête là où commence celle des autres
Homme de parole, les miens me connaissent
Mon succès n'est pas un vœux mais plutôt une promesse car

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Je suis le king de ma life, vu qu'il y a qu'une place sur le trône
Difficile de dicter et d'assumer ses choix
Mettre le king c'est tranchant comme dans Game Of Thrones
Et de surcroît, sans ta famille t'es rien faut me croire
Je traverse la vie en solitaire, #VendéeGlobe
Poséidon me mène la vie dure à chaque cap
Je navigue comme François Gabart, voilà l'époque
Dur de garder la place one quand t'es dans une barque
King de ma life, king de ma life
Gardez vos ceintures et vos rings la mienne est au doigt de ma wife
Chaque jour est un fight pour accroître ma foi
Je remercie le seigneur et lève mon verre chaque night (King!)
Comme T.I. à Atl
Maman soit heureuse, ton fils a pris le temps d'ouvrir ses ailes (King!)
Car à chacun sa bonne étoile
La mienne n'est pas sur Hollywood, mais dans le cœur, man

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Je réanime ma joie quand elle se fait percuter pas les soucis
Je suis king de ma life et ça depuis mon premier cri
J’apprends à me connaître pour éviter le feu
Car je suis mort en 1982
Et tu peux dire aux non-croyants que Dieu existe
Ne pas le reconnaître c’est comme s’enquiller 10 litres
Et rester droit sur un pupitre
Je ferai partie de ceux qui se soumettent
Car je suis le king de mon être
J’ai toujours le choix, même les difficiles
Je suis maître de moi, l’avouer c’est pas facile
Quand je me comporte comme un ignorant perdu
Habillé je ne me suis jamais senti aussi nu
Tu te rappelleras que je parlai de mon environnement
Légal ou illégal, ils seront là à mon enterrement
Souvent j’ai tiré au canon pour écraser une punaise
J’ai envie de dire au diable que je le baise

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Yes I'm so damn ready
You could put a crown on my head
I'm not bougie bougie
I'll give the shirt off my back

Yeah, j'ai du HLM dans mon ADN mama
J'aime plus la musique que ma propre vie, faut croire
Ressens-tu les ondes, quand j'mélange mon shit et ma blonde
C'est exceptionnel à voir comme la Roja
Par télépathie j'parle avec le monde
Ma mort sera-t-elle aussi touchant que celle de Lennon dans les rues de Londres
On m'attend au Sénégal et en Algérie
Car je fais pas du rap de harki
Demandes au quartier, tous, ils m'connaissent
Même en état d'ivresse, j'arrive à donner de mon cœur à cette foutu jeunesse
Prend mes cordes vocales, fais-toi-en des chaînes en or
J'suis en forme olympique, demandes à Nelson Monfort
Psy 4 de la Rime c'est des générations, des réactions humaines

Loin de leurs couronnes, loin de leur foire du trône
Sincères et vrais depuis tellement d'albums
Les chevilles anorexiques car le succès ne t'épargne pas d'la tombe

Je la peins en noir, bleu, blanc, rouge, abstraite, un peu triste comme Michel-Ange

Trop d'péchés, j'perds mon temps et mes repères
Trop déter', embrouilles, revolver
Roulette russe, tous à terre
Oh no, pourquoi la guerre? Trop de douilles et balles perdues
On ramasse à terre le fruit de la street souvent défendu
J'pense à tout plaquer quand je vois que ma vie n'avance plus

Réchauffe ces vœux que l'on faisait à deux

Ou est cette personne qui m'faisait rêver? 
Qui m'a appris a marcher

Lasse-moi au moins porter ta croix
Pour remettre des étoiles dans tes yeux
Oui, ces étoiles qui ont fait de moi
Quelqu'un de tellement heureuse

Ce sont tes rêves qui m'ont mis au monde
Et tes douleurs qui m'ont appris à parler
Ton timbre de voix m'a donné mon nom
Et tes combats m'ont appris à marcher
C'est ta vision du monde qui m'a donné la vue
C'est en suivant tes colombes que j'ai trouvé la paix
Mais aujourd'hui, tu sais, je n'te reconnais plus
Je te sens abandonnée
T'as tellement fait de concessions pour me faire connaitre
Qu'aujourd'hui tu es épuisée et perdue
Des vautours ont picorés le cœur que t'as sur la main
Et aujourd'hui tu vis au royaume des déçus
Oui je vois bien que t'as perdu la foi
Que tu n'crois plus à nos premiers combats
Mais combien rêves que tu remettes ton treillis?
Pour retrouver enfin le vrai Saïd

Quitte à croire pour tous les deux
Lasse-moi au moins porter ta croix

Kassim, jeune père
Ou t'es passé? Je te perds
Qui t'habites? Qui t'as tant fait changer?
Qui mange ton bon cœur pour te laisser que le mauvais?
Tu veux te droguer? Être sôulard
Traiter ta femme de pute et traîner au bar
Fais ton choix, mais n'oublie pas, je suis artiste
C'est toi qui as fait ce que je suis à travers mes disques
Je ne suis que le reflet de ta personne
Tu m'as appelé Alonzo et m'a présenté Akhenaton
J'ai trop mal de te regarder toucher l'fond
Tu tires tes enfants avec toi, sans bouteille, sans harpon
Khey, tu étais plus mature à 17 qu'à 30
N'essaye pas de rattraper ce que t'as pu éviter par chance
Kassim, on fait qu'un, tes conneries dégrade mon image

Le temps a fait qu'aujourd'hui je n'suis plus ton ombre
T'es la mienne Ilias, amis ou ennemis
Tu verras bien qu'c'est sur moi qu'il faudra qu'tu comptes
L'argent ça vient, ça part comme avec certain amis
Ton imagination? (Non!) Je suis bien réel
Les gens parlent de nous au singulier, jamais au pluriel
Je sais qu'j'suis exposé, je suis qu't'es réservé
J'te mets dans des histoires qu'ta mère n'arrive pas à encaisser (Ilias!)
Tu vis à travers moi, oui je t'ai remplacé
Je suis le virus dans ton couple quand tu dors dans l'canapé
Je suis le pourquoi du comment quand t'as du mal à t'confesser
Le reflet du miroir que t'as du mal à casser, mais
Toi et moi on n'fait qu'un, je n'trouve plus d'mots
Laisse-moi te porter vers le haut car

Moi j'y crois
Quitte à croire pour tous les deux
Lasse-moi au moins porter ta croix
Pour remettre des étoiles dans tes yeux
Oui, ces étoiles qui ont fait de moi
Quelqu'un de tellement heureuse
Besoin que t'y crois pour nous deux, nous deux

And you killer touch 
Put your healing hands down upon me 
My eyes are closed I'm on the floor 
A scream for help feeds your desire 
I taste the blood as you close the door 
You know I need you when the lights so out 
That's when I beg for more 

There's murder in your love 
With every kiss I'm dying 
There's murder in your love 
Don't ever say good-bye 

My limbs apart 
Marquis demanding 
Black light glowing on the wall 
The bruises here will never leave me 
i lie exposed and wait for more 
In my suspense a drop of blood 
A velvet lash that never shows 
The ecstasy binds me to you 
When you hold me close

I wanted to hold you 
But I know that your love is killing me",Murder in Your Love,1999

I was blind but now I see
I'm trapped by misery

Cities I don't recognize
And people that I cannot place

A past I know I cannot erase

I don't know what it really means to keep my dignity

And it feels like I'm riding on the winds of change

I can see the world goin' on around me
I can smell the scent of magic in the air
I can hear all the voices behind me

I can make up my mind between heaven and hell
The priest and the doctor pray for my well-being
As they research and pray that I will see the light
But I realize it's themselves who they're freeing
When I step in the box or I lie on the couch
Makes no sense to me to start pretending 
That I'll ever find salvation through a man
Mine alone is the soul that I'm mending
And I won't let this world interfere with my plans

Please get me out of here!
Help me to get out of here!

As the vapors of guilt escape through my pores
And now once again it's my conscious condition
That allows me the strength to break open the doors

生まれる前から黄昏を身にまとう
許されざる者
星くず降る砂丘を
地の果てまで歩こう
熱くなる 砂の海で
聖霊は歌うから
響かせた君の声が 届くのなら
僕はまた歩き出そう 崩れるまで
少しだけ夢に迷い 流されても
抱きしめた砂を風に乗せて旅立とう

化石が時代を刻み
原始から呼び覚ます
さまよえば硝子の河
目隠しで泳ぐから
響かせた君の声が届くのなら
僕はまた歩き出そう 崩れるまで
見極めた 夢に迷い 流されても
抱きしめた砂も 風も 変わらずに
永遠に続く 孤独の旅で
足を取られても
もう帰らない この旅路を…",Visitor,2003

Some get what some don't see

Killing time
Out of mind
Triptified

Open it up
There's not enough
No where

Where is all the screaming crowd
And as I bring on what's inside of me
I know it's quite a dream

Light the night to make it like the day, it really won't glow
It really won't

Supersonic architecture Spanish castle cream
Press my hands against my ears to try to make the voices clear
An acrobatic, symphonic helicopter scream
All that shines will come in time
Never mind all that's left behind
Lovestone blind, well still is mine
Here I find my piece of mind
Now they look into the eyes of a silver screen can of lies
The city streets are the golden cage of the sleeping flies
Wings pounding to the concrete dance of stamping shoes
Gold seeping from the hand of the unamused
Down though the smoke to the trash scattered to the ground
Cut through the smell of the sirens screaming through the town
Kneeling down to the healing fix of a hypodermic crucifix
Hanging from the choking throats of giant stack of broken bricks

Let'em fly, let'em fly like rain
Well it's only time
I can't taste the morning
When the rays of the killing sun won't shine
Blue as the wind, blew it all, blew it all the time
I see the sky burning red
Burning inside of you
So let it rain down hard
Let it break on through
I see your world, I see your seas
And I know what's going to be left
When you leave what you leave for me
You're pulling me down
Don't lay down when the sun shines
",Only Time,
Psychotic Waltz,"The universe is in my eye
Scattered are the pages of the world
Everybody's praying to the nothing in the sky
They cry for what they've laid upon the world
Blue for the shattered sky
Everybody's looking to the sky
Waiting for the rain to pour into their overflowing hands
Waiting, waiting
This life is mine
I'm living in my time
You gave, you slaved
You thought that you'd be saved
Now you're waiting like the flies
To drag your tongue across my eyes
I claw into my hole all the ashes of my soul
Blue for the shattered sky

Wurden meine Freunde zwangsgeräumt und abgeschoben
Denn du darfst genauso solange bleiben wie du Geld hast
Und danach bist du kein anerkannter Teil dieser Gesellschaft
Räudige Methoden, in Briefen freundlich drohen
Inserieren und verkaufen, obwohl noch Leute drin wohnen
Das sind täuschend echte Häuserkämpfe, wenn auch ohne Krieg
Du erkennst Gangster am Profit, fick die Sell-Out-Politik

Zwischen den Kulturen, unser Viertel liebt ihr doch nur deswegen
Man kann's jeden Tag sehen, hier wird Verständnis zum Fremdwort
In Szene-Cafes, wo man auf Englisch bestellen muss
Parallelgesellschaft wenn's um Gastarbeiter geht
Doch wenn die Hipster unter sich bleiben, ist das auf einmal ok?
Der Vorbesitzer wurde da per Räumungsklage rausgeholt
Die Stammkunden pöbeln und bekommen sofort Hausverbot
Meine neuen Nachbarn rufen permanent die Bullen
Wenns zu laut und asi ist, warum seid ihr hergezogen?
In den Arbeiterkiez, wo wenig Menschen Arbeit haben
Habt ihr doch kein Fuß gesetzt in den letzten zwanzig Jahren
Und mich kriegt ihr auch nicht weg, ich bleib bestimmt hier für immer

All das, was du hier nicht kennst aus deinem Dorf
Mauerblümchen stranden hier und verwelken auch sofort
Diese Stadt hat kein Meer - hier musst du U-Bahn surfen

Guck, in meiner Stadt gehen die Parties manchmal zweiundsiebzig Stunden
Aber keiner hat für Reue oder Zweifel Zeit gefunden

PTK,"Was denkst du wer du bist, dass du mir sagst was sich gehört
Du steckst nicht in meiner Haut, noch nicht mal in diesem Shirt
Sag, was siehst du in mir
Ich bin kein Ausländer, trotzdem war ich nie integriert
Hier, in dieser Ellenbogengesellschaft
Wo man sich nur Sorgen um sich selbst, Drogen und Geld macht
Und es immer einen gibt, der über andere bestimmt
Kann nix dafür dass ich so Anti bin, es fing schon an als Kind
Mein Vater hat mir noch nie 'ne Grußkarte gesendet
Sondern meine letzten zwanzig Geburtstage vergessen
Ist nichts gutes bei Versprechen nicht zu sehen kann wie sie brechen
Aber daraus lernt man auch was, vermutlich auch am besten
Und ich weiß noch als ich klein war, wie meine Mutter rein kam
Und geschrien hat: „Mach die scheiß Mukke leiser“
Fang was mit dei'm Leben an, so wie es all die anderen machen
Heute ist sie stolz, denn ich hab mir nie was sagen lassen

Wo ich meine Fußspuren lass wächst nichts mehr, nur totes Gras
Schulnoten (ach)
Auf Zukunft (gekackt)
Die Ärzte haben gesagt ich hab Blutgruppe Hass
Ich hab was, ich hab was, ich hab Blutgruppe Hass
Ich hab was, ich hab was, ich hab Blutgruppe Hass
Und ich kann nix dafür, komm wir machen was kaputt
Erst irgendwelche Sachen und dann uns

Ich war nie gut in Chemie, eins weiß ich aber schon
Gewalt ist keine Lösung sondern eine Reaktion
Immer wenn er weiter wächst, daran erblinden viele Menschen
Der Trick ist sie zu lenken an die richtigen Adressen
Ich muss ihm danken, denn er machte dass ich rappe
Und er schreibt seit Tag Eins wirklich alle meine Texte
Hatte ich nix zu essen, dann hat er mir mein Bauch gefüllt
Mein Samariter, mein Aushängeschild
Immer unzufrieden, ihr könnt, alles nur mir nicht den Mund verbieten
Oder mich dazu bringen brav zu funktionieren
Ist nicht so mein Ding bei bestimmten Sachen einzulenken
Man ich weiß am besten, ich bin nicht leicht zu händeln
Aber jeder hat paar Macken, Fehler machen alle
An der Stelle schöne Grüße an die Mädchen die ich hatte
Ich bin eigentlich nicht Schuld für die Tränen in deinem Gesicht
Wie das Leben halt so ist, verstehst du ihn, verstehst du mich
Ich lernte nie was Liebe ist, kannte es nie anders
Und irgendwann ist es dann Standart
Doch ich brauchte nie 'ne Therapie und keine Durchhalteparolen
Weil mein Hass auf die Welt pure Motivation ist

Bin umsonst aber nie umsonst auf Demos aufgetreten
Kämpfe jeden Tag ein Stück damit mein Ego aufzulösen
Und tu alles für die Sache und die Wirkung von den Songs
Aber niemals für ein Danke, das wirst du nicht bekommen

Als ob's um Leben oder Sterben geht
Als wird nur der erleuchtet, der's als erster kriegt
Ich hab's umgedreht und mach es zu meinem Markenzeichen
Wenn alle etwas haben, dann hab ich davon keines
Bevor ich euch kopiere, boykottiere ich's, stolz
Kaufst du dir immer alles neu wenn's ma nicht alles läuft so wie es soll
Ich seh's an dir, weswegen es so gut funktioniert
Du pilgerst in die Konsumtempel, betest zu buntem Papier
Vergiss deine Ideen und gib am Besten dein Talent auf
Du kannst sicher sein, irgendwer hat schon längst Patent drauf
Und such dir dein Glück, vielleicht steht es im Sortiment drin
Alles ist möglich, hier gibt's Regeln ohne Grenzen
Dabei gibt es gar kein Gold da wo die Regenbogen enden
Sollte umgekehrt sein, aber Knete formt die Menschen

Ich feier Leute mit Charakter, die sich selbst Prinzipien setzen
Und verachte sie genau ab dem Moment wenn sie sie brechen
Hier in dieser scheiß Gesellschaft, die sich gegenseitig runtermacht
Hat keiner bisher wesentliche Themen auf den Punkt gebracht
Alle zu beschäftigt mit sich selbst
Deutscher Rap ist voll mit Egoscheiße und damit scheffeln die noch Geld
Es geht um Drogen, Sex, Gewalt, ich bin hier sowas von falsch
Aber Geld ist sowieso nicht der Lohn für meine Zeit
Ich mach Workshops mit Kids, die erinnern mich an mich
Du kannst es besser wissen, nur ein Kind kann es noch nicht
Und genau das macht mich reich, denn ein Batzen voll mit Scheinen
Ist auch niemals so viel wert wie das Lachen von den Kleinen
Und klar, Digga, ich weiß, dass ich selber nicht perfekt bin
Du verstehst was falsch, ich will die Welt auch gar nicht retten
Soll sie brennen und verrecken, wie gesagt
Jeden Tag verliert sie an Wert für mich
Mir ist sie egal

Schlägt um sich rum, um sich Platz zu schaffen
Um sich nicht anzupassen und um dir Angst zu machen

Doch alles andere ist für mich keine Option mehr
Bin gegen Kompromisse bei den Dingen, die ich tu'

Guck mich an ich bin immer noch der gleiche Visionär
Jeder Song von mir ist für mich eine Mission mehr
Und guck dich um, alle anderen gründen Familie
Vielleicht find' ich meine Traumfrau, doch ich kann ihr nie was bieten
Und dann wird sie wieder gehen und ich würd' es verstehen
In dieser Welt ist es wohl klüger sich nur mit ihr mit zu drehen
Ist kein Geheimnis jeder weiß, ich bin kein Fan von den Menschen
Denn ich denk nicht in Grenzen
Und ich lasse mich auch letztlich nicht bremsen
Von sämtlichen Existenzängsten
Und den ganzen kommerziellen Zwängen

Alle hier sind komplett kollektiv verblendet
Ich muss da raus kommt mir vor wie ein Gefängnis
Und vielleicht bin ich in mein' Werten gefangen

Treff deswegen täglich neue Leute, muss mein Netzwerk pflegen
Bündel die Talente gegen was sie mit Gesetzen regeln
Wenn dir die Connections fehlen, kann ich dir Adressen geben
In meinen Texten geht es nie um wer ist hier der Beste?
Es geht um Behördengänge und gefälschte Dokumente
Es gibt immer einen Weg, wenn sie verhindern, dass er doch bleibt (doch bleibt)
Dann arrangieren wir 'ne Hochzeit
Und will dein Vermieter morgen deine Butze räumen
Stehen heute noch vor seiner ein paar vermummte Leute
PTK ist im Gebäude und sowas auf Songs zu rappen
Ist vielleicht nicht gerade schlau und hat bestimmt auch Konsequenzen
Ich werd' eh nicht zu den Stars hier in Deutschland gehören
Denn was ich rappe ist zu wahr, und das wollen sie nicht hören

PTK,"Sie sagen meine Sparte Rap ist Politik
Dabei kotz ich mich nur aus als hätt' ich Bulimie
Diese Plastikmenschen sind so satt gefressen
Und ich hab mir geschworen, dass ich nie werde so wie die
Gib mir dreckige Drums und ein paar traurige Geigen
Anstatt den wertlosen Kram aus euren Schaufensterscheiben
Ich bin nicht wie das kleine Männchen auf dem Baustellenzeichen
Mein ganzes Leben lang gefallen nur um 'ne Schaufel zu halten
Ich muss hier raus, mich entfalten, hab immer Hunger im Kopf
Der sich nie stillen ließ mit ihrem Unterrichtsstoff
Ich wollt' nie aufessen was sie auftischen, gibt es ein System
Dann gibt es auch Lücken und die muss ich rausfinden
Mich damit locken dass ich selber etwas mach
Was ich von Herzen gar nicht will hat auch mit Geld noch nie geklappt
Das richtige Gericht liegt auf dem Teller und macht satt
Und das falsche bringt dich wenn du Pech hast mal in' Knast
Jemand wie ich ist niemals kompatibel mit dem Staatsprogramm
Weil dir kein Plattendeal vermittelt wird beim Arbeitsamt
Ich muss die Wahrheit sagen und ich bring sie auch in Umlauf
Denn wenn du Hunger hast, dann machst du auch den Mund auf!

Spürt ihr diesen Hunger
Diese Leere in mei'm Herz
Dieses stechen in mei'm Bauch
Ich will leben und ich merk diesen Hunger
Jeden Tag ein bisschen mehr
Warum habt ihr nix was mich ernährt? Dieser Hunger
Und die Reichen werden fetter (fetter)
Wie die meisten eurer Rapper
Dieser Hunger fickt mein Leben und hört bitte nie auf
Denn er hält mich am Boden und er bringt mich hier raus

Aus der Generation, die die Dinge in die Hand nimmt
Nur wenn sie Touchscreen haben
Und die Bedienung sie nicht anstrengt, bin ich gekomm'
Ich bin nicht konform, du willst 'n Liebeslied?
Du kriegst 'nen Fick-Dich-Song!
Denn meine Lieder sind für asoziale
Und niemals Industrie- und Massenware
Fokussiert und so gezielt wie Attentate
Wer will verbieten in den Strophen, wie und was ich sage
Wer? Ihr? Dann mach ich's umso mehr
Ich bin kein Bock in Person, die Trotzreaktion
Ihr bloß so ne Schoßhunde, hier ein Stock, geht in holen
Das hier ist ein freies Land, so preisen sie es an
Doch reiß dein Maul einmal auf und jemand stopft dir das schon
Was man nicht sagen darf heißt für mich dass ich's trotzdem rappe
Warum Rücksicht nehmen auf irgendwelche Zottelköpfe
Die mich nicht verstehen, weil ich nicht leb so wie die
In euren Kreisen eck ich an, simple Geometrie

Spürt ihr diesen Hunger
Diese Leere in mei'm Herz

Denn wir entfernen uns langsam voneinander so wie Kontinente
Irgendwann liegen ganze Meere zwischen uns
Und man kann nicht mal eben mit 'ner Fähre rüberkommen
Die Distanz wird zu groß, der Ozean liegt grad ruhig
Doch ab und an tobt ein Sturm, bis einer von uns kentert 
Wir sind ertrunken in der Flut aus Streit und es hat uns voll verändert
Kalt wie ein Dezember, fühl mich bei dir wie ein Fremder
Ich merk mir diesen Tag und kreis ihn ein in mei'm Kalender
Du hast Spuren hinterlassen, ich versuch' sie zu verwischen
Ich find ich bin ziemlich gut darin das Gute nicht zu finden
Wo die Liebe hinfällt juckt mich kaum
Ich lass sie liegen, im Vorbeigehen spuck ich drauf
Denn du hast Spuren hinterlassen, ich versuch dich nicht zu hassen
Ha, ich versuch's

Doch bitte lass mich dir die Schuld geben und bitte nimm sie
Und bitte bring sie ganz weit weg von mir
Auf das sie mich verlässt so wie du
So wie du mich damals, so wie ich dich damals
Und bitte lass mich dir die Schuld geben und bitte nimm sie
Und bitte bring sie ganz weit weg von mir
Auf das sie mich verlässt so wie du
So wie du mich damals, so wie ich dich damals

Du hast mein Herz damals rausgerissen, eingepackt und mitgenommen
Ich hab's versucht, doch ich hab's einfacht nicht mehr zurückbekommen
Jetzt schlägt nur noch ein Stück davon, der Rest ist nachgewachsen
Nur, dass die Herzkammern und -Klappen genau so schwarz wie Hass sind
Damals ist ein Teil in mir gestorben und im Gegenzug jede Wut ein Teil von mir geworden
Trifft der Fall von heut auf morgen, könntest du Ausflippen vor Glück
Bis er dir irgendwann aus deiner Brust herausgerissen wird
Es hat mich faustdick erwischt, tausendmal geküsst
Ausgerechnet ich hab geglaubt, dass es es gibt
Für andere Frauen empfind' ich nix seit dir
Jedenfalls nicht mehr so
Meine Welt geht unter, ihr Regenwald brennt lichterloh
Vielleicht bin ich ein Misanthrop, vielleicht war ich's davor schon
Vielleicht holt dich das niemals ein, vielleicht reicht dir dein Vorsprung
Aber mich verfolgt es immer noch und ja, ich krieg ne Macke
Weil egal ist was ich mache, es bleibt da so wie ein Schatten
Wir haben uns Jahre nicht gesehen, was die Zeit uns alles nimmt
Ich weiß nicht mehr wie du aussiehst und wie deine Stimme klingt
Doch du hast Spuren hinterlassen und sie haben sich eingebrannt
Ein allerletztes Mal, bitte tu mir einen Gefallen

Bitte lass mich dir die Schuld geben und bitte nimm sie
Und bitte bring sie ganz weit weg von mir
Auf das sie mich verlässt so wie du
So wie du mich damals, so wie ich dich damals
Und bitte lass mich dir die Schuld geben und bitte nimm sie
Und bitte bring sie ganz weit weg von mir

Ich war sieben, dann kamst du, du hast geschrien rund um die Uhr
Normalerweise kommt man auf die Welt auf friedliche Natur
Du warst von Anfang an traurig, ich glaub es liegt in unserem Blut
Denn sie trug dich im Bauch, doch dort trug sie auch ihre Wut
Ich weiß sie kann schwierig sein, doch sie meint vieles immer gut
Alleinerziehend ab dem Moment deiner Geburt
Und ich glaub ich hab geglaubt, dass es an dir liegt
Ich war einfach noch zu klein um zu kapieren was da passiert ist
Tut mir leid, ich weiß zu Haus hattest du's nicht leicht
Reingeboren in eine Welt in der's andauernd Krach und Streit gibt
Du bist so stur wie ich, frech und immer laut
Sie war mit mir überfordert, an dir lässt sie es dann aus
Doch sei nicht sauer auf sie, wenn dann sei sauer auf ihn
Sie zog dich groß zu genau so 'ner starken Frau genau so wie sie es ist

Ich vermisse diese Zeit ein bisschen, selbst den Streit
Ich bin der Älteste, dem keiner gezeigt hat wie man ein Mann wird
Der trotzdem wusste, dass man Frauen mit Anstand behandelt
Denn wenn du 'ne Schwester hast, dann siehst du Mädchen nicht wie Fleisch
Und was soll ich sagen, ich bin gesegnet, ich hab zwei
Es ist komisch, es gibt Dinge, die ich niemals erzähle
Und dann schreib ich einfach mein Leben in Liedern wie dem hier

Vor jedem „Wie geht's dir?“
Vor „Bitte grüß den Rest der Familie von mir, ihr fehlt mir“

Sie starren Stunden auf ein' Kasten, dabei lernen sie nichts
Ich guck hoch in die Sterne - das ist Fernsehen für mich
Jeder Ozean verdreckt und jedes Meer leer gefischt
Dein Körper aus Wasser, aber kein Klärwerk für dich
Krebs tötet alle, der ganze Globus kämpft
Und Monsanto hat auf Broccoli Patent - so ist der Mensch

Weiße Cops erschießen einen Schwarzen

Weil sie es niemals tun werden - du brauchst nie wieder zu fragen

Wesen, dass es niemals gegeben hat
Und das ist auch irgendwie zwar Schade

You can ask the hoes in my flat 
Shaq made a path I came through walkin 
Now I'm pushin and got the whole cold stalkin 
Feelin me knowin that I'm winning in the beginning 
You thought it was a phase till I heard a brother read 
Peter Gunz un fellow chapter uno bruise like Bruno 
Slam like sumo who know money you know 
I bring the funk like under arm and see me on 
That's why they get me on delivery my denemerey

For all these undercover haters tryin to get these 
Forget that cause baby mamma want to hit these 
And bring me drama while these cowards tryin to stick these 
So nick these I'ma shine like the Sun do

Stick together close like hand and glove
",Slow Dance,2001
Public Announcement,"You know, we have this old saying
You won't miss your water, until your well runs dry
And some of us may not know what that means
But what that means is
When your first love leaves you
You might be walking through the park, or maybe at the movies
And just happen to see that person with someone else
And all those old feelings just come back

The first time that I saw you 
I remember how in love I was with you
Then things started, slowly to change 
I miss your body, will I ever hold you again 
Cause you told me that you needed 
Me for you that's why I made sacrifices 
All this time invested what compares to what we do 
When I see you with him you're walking on what we knew

1 - When I see you in his arms
I wish his arms were mine
When I see you kissing him
I wish his lips were mine
When I see you holding him
I wish his body was mine
I can't stand being without you girl

I gave you my heart girl from the beginning 
And I never stopped loving you when you said let's be friends
I thought it was over, my feelings for you
Until the day when I saw both of you
My heart dropped as I approached you
And when I shook his hand girl I felt you
And when I looked you straight girl, straight in your eyes 
I felt you crying as I said bye-bye, bye baby

Repeat 1

In my life, oh
Yeah baby, oh yeah, heh
All those lonely nights, I spent without you 
I still see the images of me and you
When we were making love day and night
I never be without you by my side
Oh baby can't you see 
That we were meant to be 
Together forever baby just you and me 
And I don't think that I can get you out of my mind
Cause I'll be waiting for you till the end of time 

Repeat 1 till end

Sho nuff stuff to grab
Like shirts it hurts
With a neck to wreck

Took a toll

Shut 'em down

Six seven eight nine

I hit it hard

Like uncle L said I'm rippin' up shows
Then what it is
Only 5 percent of the biz

I'm addin' woes
That's how da way it goes

I own loans

Whole from the ground

Throw another round
Sick of the ride
It's suicide
For the other side of town

Who count the money
In da neighborhood
But we spendin' money

To no end lookin' for a friend
In a war to the core
Rippin' up the poor in da stores
Till they get a brother

Kickin' down doors
Then I figure I kick it bigger
Look 'em dead in the eye
And they wince

Defense is pressurized
They don't want it to be
Another racial attack
In disguise so give some money back

I like Nike but wait a minute
The neighborhood supports so put some
Money in it
Corporations owe

Dey gotta give up the dough
To da town
Or else
We gotta shut 'em down",Shut 'Em Down]],

        Rock, get up, get down

        The match up title, the expression of thrill
        For elite to compete and attempt to get ill
        If looks could kill, I'd chill until
        The public catches on to my material
        Ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
        Can't wait to read the headlines of my capture
        Accused of assault, a 1st degree crime
        Cause I beat competitors with my rhymes
        Tongue whipped, pushed, shoved and tripped
        Coocked from the hold of my Kung Fu grip
        And if you want my title, it would be suicidal
        From my end, it would be homicidal
        When I do work, you get destroyed
        Make all the paranoid, try to avoid
        The Public Enemy seat I've enjoyed
        This is no kid and I'm no toy boy

        Rock, get up, get down
        Miuzi weighs a ton

        I'm a Public Enemy but I don't rob banks
        I don't shoot bullets and I don't shoot blanks
        My style is supreme, number one is my rank
        And I got more power than the New York Yanks
        If miuzy wasn't heavy I'd probably fire it
        I'd make you walk the plank if I was a pirate
        If they made me a King, I would be a tyrant
        If you want to get me, go ahead and try it
        Snatcher, dispatcher, biter never been a
        Instead of takin' me out, take a girl to dinner
        The level of comp has never been thinner
        It's a runaway race where I'm the winner
        It's unreal, they call the law
        And claimed I had started a war
        It was war they wanted and war they got
        But they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot

        Rock, get up, get down
        Miuzi weighs a ton

        My style versatile said without rhymes
        Which is why they're after me on my back
        Lookin' over my shoulder, seein' what I write
        Hearin' what I say, they wonderin' why
        Why they can't ever compete on my level
        Superstar status is my domain
        Understand my rhythm, my pattern of lecture
        And then you'll know why I'm on the run
        This change of events results in a switch
        Lateral movements of my vocal pitch
        It eliminates pressure on the haunted
        But the posse is around so I got to front it
        Plus employ tactics so coy
        And leave no choise but to destroy
        Soloists, groups and what they say
        And all that try to cross my way",Miuzi Weighs a Ton,1987
Public Enemy,"Yo Chuck, bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio, you know what I'm saying
And this brother stopped me and asked me
""Yo, what's up with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice?""
I said, ""Yo, the brother don't swear he nice, he knows he's nice"", you know what I'm saying
So Chuck, we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to L.A. Laurelton Queens
While we was in the car on our way to the shop
Well yo, right now, kick the bass for them brothers and let 'em know
What goes on

What goes on?
Well I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
1-2-3 down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap - 49er supreme
Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team
Cause I can go solo, like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, 110 degrees
So don't start bassing, I'll start placing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one, one
One, one, one, one!

You got no rap but you want to battle
It's like having a boat but you've got no paddle
Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores but I break all laws
Written while sitting, all bidding not hidden
Giving me the juice that you're not getting
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'mma non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible so start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught up, for going out of order
And now you're serving football teams their water
You messed with the Master, word to Chuck
And I waxed cold taxed, make sure you got dunked
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees you get me pissed
It's no fun being on the run
Because they got me Public Enemy number one

Don't you know, don't you know..
I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out, we got metal to match
Ambush attack on my back, double-team you get creamed
So we have it, so you won't catch
Wanna hear it again we got a force, enemy down
The L.I. circuit sound
And Chuckie D, myself and K-Jee, Flavor, DJ Melo-D
Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But it's also the words from our direction, out the homeboy section
Kicking like Bruce Lee ""Chinese Connection""
On stereo, never ever mono
On wax, yes, I'm talking about vinyl
They said ""Stop! Freeze!"" I got froze up
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

For all you
Suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic, political, lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one

Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You gotta tell 'em just like that, you know what I'm saying
Cause yo man, let me tell you a little something man
These brothers running around, hard headed
They get a little jealous, you know what I'm saying
Just like that, you know, they're trying to bring you down with them
But yo Chuck, you got to let them know who's who in the world to be
You got to let them know, that this is the 80's
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes
And that's the way the story goes
That's just the way the story goes
Let me tell you a little something man",Public Enemy No. 1,1987
Public Enemy,"(chorus) Raise your hands, so we can
                 Raise the roof, so you can
                 Raise your voice, so we can
                 Raise the roof

        Raise the roof because it's all on fire
        Not done by the sun or electrical wire
        Not done by sons stricking matches with daughters
        But done by scratches so save that water
        This jam is packed so I just figure
        All we need is the house to get bigger
        So startin' with the roof down to the base
        We're at your service to burn the place

        (repeat chorus)

        With the spot as hot as it can get
        The roof's on fire, you're soaked and wet
        The puzzle on your face shows as you sweat
        But your body keeps movin' with no regrets
        Chandeliers shake, swing from front to back
        Left to right all night, and the lights don't crack
        Your minds on the time, hopin' it don't end
        It's time to get stupid, here we go again

        (repeat chorus)

        Stare at the strope, pull your earlobe
        For the sights and sounds clear across the globe
        This jam might hit or miss the charts
        But the style gets wild as state of the art
        Dazzling in science, bold in nerve
        But givin' my house what it deserves
        Served on the floor cause I got payed
        Make the fans that left, wished they had'a stayed
        Realize my friend, ain't this a trip
        As your body gets railed when you do the flip
        And your mind gets rocked when we're on a roll
        Then the freak of the week makes you loose control
        A Swatch for a watch, so you'll know the time
        Your crowd gets loud and you clock my rhyme
        The messiah's on fire and I'm living proof
        I'll quench your desire and raise your roof

        (repeat chorus)

        In school I'm cool throughout the week
        When the weekend comes, I'm down with the Greeks
        Frat brothers known across the seven seas
        Fly ladies of the 80's, sororities
        Zetas, Deltas, AKA's
        Women that keep me in a daze
        Phi Sigma boys in the move
        With the Kappas and the Ques and of course the grooves to
        And for real it's the deal and the actual fact
        Takes a nation of millions to hold me back
        Rejected and accepted as a communist
        Claimin' fame to my name as a terrorist
        Makin' money in corners that you'll never see
        Dodgin'judges and the lawyers and the third degree
        Nothin' wrong with a song to make the strong survive
        Realize gave me five cause I kept 'em alive
        Mislead what you read bout my devilish deeds
        Mislead what I said so you're better off dead
        Make 'em hear it and see it for the Def and blind
        And command it and we'll plan it for incapable minds
        Take for granted and demand it from the wave of my hand
        Make the jealous understand it, just say damn
        When they see me ask a question, ""How can it be?""
        When they watch me pull a serpent straight out of the sea
        Turn the winter into summer, then from hot to cold
        Expand my power on the hour, make you all behold
        From the slammer swing a hammer like the mighty Thor
        God of thunder, you'll go under, then you'll all applaud
        And fathom that distance, the mad must reap
        Meet Namor sea lord, Prince of the deep
        Here for you to fear at any cost
        Tellin you to get busy or you better get lost
        Livin' lives civilized from the lessons I tauhgt
        Cities buried underground just because I went off
        My friends, enemies, better be my friend
        Is queston people guessin' is this the end?

        End of the world, are you guessin' yes?
        Just say don't delay it, get it off your chest
        Houses of crack, I've seen too much
        I go ready, aim, fire, then I'll blow 'em up",Raise the Roof,1987

        Some want to build a posse, some stay away
        Some people think that we plan to fail
        Wonder why we go under or go to yail
        Some ask us why we act the way we act
        Without lookin' how long they kept us back

        Yes you if I bore you, I won't ignore you

        Can't sell it, no you can't buy it in a potion

        Tellin' me about a head, you decided to fly
        Another brother with the same woes that you face
        But you shot with the same hands, you fall from grace
        Every brother should be every brother's keeper

For the stunts and the blunts, whole world inside
The reason that the mighty used force supplied
No comp, we'll stomp all in our way
Gave me static so I won't pay
It might be a trick that you don't like

It might seem like that we don't care

Public Enemy,"In this corner with the 98
        Subject of suckers object of hate
        Who's the one some think is great
        I'm that one, son of a gun
        Drivin' by, wavin' my fist
        Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
        Top gun, never on the run
        They know not to come cause they all get some
        Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
        Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain
        Out the window, middle finger for all
        Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
        Suckers got the nerve and gall
        To talk 'bout my car when they're walkin' tall
        Pullin' away, every day
        Leavin' you in the dust
        So you know I get paid, on the mile ego trip
        And 5-o tailin' on my tip
        Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame
        This episode always is the same
        Seein' no comp comin' like I'm blind
        All left back, tailin' my behind
        I go faster cops try to shoot me
        They'll get theirs when they try to get me
        I'll let go, my turbo
        Run, I'm in the river cause they're movin' too slow
        Laughin' hard at their attempt
        So what if the judge charged me contempt
        I'd rub my boomerang, feelin' proud
        And I wouldn't even hear them cause my radio's loud

        Cruisin' down the boulevard
        treated like a superstar
        You know the time so don't look hard
        Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car
        All you suckers in the other ride
        When I'm comin' get to the side
        My 98 is tough to chase
        If you're on my tail, better watch my face
        Smoke is comin' when I burn
        Rubber when my wheels turn
        Tinted windows, super bad
        Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
        It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
        It's the reason I left them back
        It's the reason all the people say
        My 98-O blows 'em all away
        Understand, I don't drive drunk
        My 98's fly, I don't drive no junk
        No cop gotta a right to call me a punk
        Take his ticket, go to hell and stick it
        Pull me on a kick but, line up, times up
        This government needs a tune up
        I don't even know what happenin', what's up
        Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest
        Sidewalk suckered wanted to spill me
        So I got my crew and posse
        Step outside, got in my ride
        Drove them around, looked around town
        Caught I'm out there cold, ran I'm over and down
        They didn't get me, that's the truth
        Cause my 98-O is bullet proof",You're Gonna Get Yours,1987
Public Enemy,"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact

Won't be on a play list

The one and only missionary lord son of a gun
Going on and on back trackin' the whack
Explain the knack y'all for the actual fact, c'mon

Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Go, go, go, go, go, go

He goes on and on 'till he reaches the coast
Tired, wired of his own race playing him close
Understand his type of music kills the
Plan of the klan
You know the pack attack the man
With the palm of his hands
Police, wild beasts, dogs on a leash
No peace to reach, that's why he's packin' his black piece
Terminator X yellin' with his hands
Damn almighty rulin ready to jam
But his cuts drive against the belt
Sheet, he's bad by his damn self
Yeah, his one job cold threatens the crowd
The loud sound pound to make brothers proud

Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Gettin' small makin' room for it all
Flavors on the phone so he can
Make the call
I know you're clockin' the enemy
You should be clockin' the time
Checkin' records I'm wreckin' you
For defecting my rhyme
No provokin', no jokin', you know the stage is set
If you're thinkin' I'm breakin'
He ain't rocked it yet
My education is takin' you for a long ride
I'll make you brain slip and do the slide
Glide into infinity, it's infinite
With your hands in your pockets
I know your money is spent
Like this, like that, butter for the fat
If you kill my dog, I'ma slay your cat
It's like that y'all, can you handle it son
I'm public enemy number one

Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off

Going, going, gone
Now I dialed 911 a long time ago
Don't you see how late they're reacting
They only come and they come when they wanna
So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner
They don't care cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace they can't be betrayed
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose your arms, your legs to them it's compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation
It all adds up to a fucked up situation

So get up get, get get down

Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here with the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect
But late 911 was a joke cause they only joking
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a
911 is a joke we don't want 'em
I call a cab cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
Reason why I say that cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at you while you're crawling on your knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver

So get up get, get get down

Public Enemy,"When I'm talkin' rhyme time
To blow your mind time some say
It's nothing worse than a verse
To hear some nigger curse
They call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
Claimin' I boast and smoke
And sometimes sing the blues
I twang metal and settle
Try to never back pedal
From the power some got
To get a nigger shot
The null and void I avoid
I test the paranoid
Never had to be bad
My mama raised me mad
So what I got is hot
I love my life a lot
I'm never sad just glad
That's why I thank my dad
Once they never gave a fuck about
What I said
Now they listen and they want my head

Instead of peace the police
Just want to wreck and flex
On the kid
What I did was try to be the best
So they fingered the trigger
Figured I was a bigger nigger
And started to search
An so I headed west
Went to Cali to rally
Was for a brothers death
It was the fuzz who shot him
An not da blood or 'cause
I wondered why it was like
So I just held my mike
But in my mind I was blind
So I just tried to find
A reason we was quick
Just the way that we was
So I just stayed in the crib
Until I got a buzz",Anti-Nigger Machine,1990
Public Enemy,"Uh, your bad self
Help me break this down from off the shelf
Here's a music servin' you so use it
Papa's got a brand new funk
Get down (party for your right)
Huh, let's get it on
Like we said before
They say the brothers causin' trouble
Hate to bust their bubble
'Cause we rumble
From our lower level
To condition your condition
(We're gonna do a song)
That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasin'
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

[Chorus]
You got it what it takes
Go get it where you want it?
Come get it get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

So many of us in limbo
How to get it on, it's quite simple
Three stones from the sun
We need a piece of this rock
Our goal indestructible soul
Answers to this quizzin'
To the Brothers in the streetSchools and the prisons
History shouldn't be a mystery
Our stories real history
Not his story
We gonna work it one day
Till we all get paid
The right way in full, no bull
Talkin', no walkin', drivin', arrivin' in style
Soon you'll see what I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause one day
The brothers gonna work it out
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

[Chorus]

You got it  what it takes
Go get it where you want it?
Come get it get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street
Are willing to work it out

Let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'

Now we are ready if you are ready

In 1995, you'll twist to this
As you raise your fist to the music
United we stand, yes divided we fall
Together we can stand tall
Brothers that try to work it out
They get mad, revolt, revise, realize
They're super bad
Small chance a smart brother's
Gonna be a victim of his own circumstance
Sabotaged, Shellshocked, rocked and ruled
Day in the life of a fool
Like I said before to live it low
Life take you time, time yo go slow
Look here, not a thing to fear
Brother to brother not another as sincere
Teach a man how to be father
To never tell a woman he can't bother
You can't say you don't know
What I'm talkin' 'bout
But one day  brothers gonna work it out

You got it  what it takes
Go get it  where you want it?
Come get it  get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street
Are willing to work it out

Let's get it on we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'
