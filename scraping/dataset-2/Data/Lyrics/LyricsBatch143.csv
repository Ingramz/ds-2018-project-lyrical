Dick Powell,"I appreciate the simple things
Cause I'm awfully fond of getting
Love in an actual setting.
This is what I call the simple things:
Just a winding stream where I can drift and dream.
And now I'm waiting for you.

By a waterfall I'm calling you.
We can share it all beneath a ceiling of blue.
We'll spend a heavenly day
Here where the whispering waters play.
There's a whipper will that's calling you.
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too.
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Beside a waterfall with you.

There's a whipper will that's calling.
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too.
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Besides a waterfall with you.","By A Waterfall (used in the film ""Footlight Parade"")",2002

Dick Powell,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodil who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's
When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn
 
Good night, baby
Good night, milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey!
 
Come on along and you can listen to
A baby cry the lullaby of ole' Broadway
The jump and jivin' and the swingin' roo
The lullaby of Broadway
The band begins to jam a tune
And everyone goes crazy
You rock-a-bye your baby soon
The atmosphere gets hazy
Hush I'll buy you this and that,
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day
 
Sleep tight, my baby
Get a lot of sleep as time goes by
Good night, my baby
Have a lot of fun in the night time
Get a lot of sleep in the day time
Good night, good night
Let's call it a day
Good night, good night, good night
Milkman's on his way

Before you travel on

Look down, look down that lonesome road

Dick Rivers,"Twist à Saint-Tropez
Ca fait partie de l'ambiance
De Saint-Tropez
C'est là que commencent
Toutes les danses
Qu'on lance en France
Pour les vacances
Twist à Saint-Tropez
On est toujours en avance
A Saint-Tropez
Vadim et Brigitte
Sacha nous quittent;
Un jour ils sont de retour!

Ils ne pourront jamais s'en passer
Tous viennent ici pour m'amuser
Tous ont un jour appris à danser

Dick Rivers,"J'ai longtemps chaviré
Dans des courants rebelles
Me laissant entraîner
le vide est sans appel
J'aimais le jour qui meurt
La vie à mille à l'heure
Le goût des longues soirées
Je refoulais mes peurs
Je joins mes mains aux tiennes
Pour vivre entrelacés
Et que rien ne revienne
Des douleurs du passé
Dans un monde tragique
Fait de masques et de leurres
J'ai cherché le magique
Dans un bain de tiédeur
Et toi tu étais là
A des années lumières
Loin de tous ces gens las
Tapie dans ton repère
C'est bien beau le show bizz
On est tous frères et soeurs
On s'aime on s'fait la bise
On s'poignarde en plein coeur
Tu ne m'as rien promis
Pas tout de suite souri
Mais quand tu m'as touché
J'ai su qu'j'étais dans l'vrai
Je joins mes mains aux tiennes
Pour vivre entrelacés
Et que rien ne revienne
Des douleurs du passé
Je joins mes mains aux tiennes
Pour vivre entrelacés
Et que quoi qu'il advienne
Rien n'puisse nous séparer",Entrelacés,2001

That old gal of mine.

Please send her back to me.

Dick Robertson,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1992
Dick Robertson,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds

Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words,1992
Dick Robertson,"All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing, 
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring
And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night time too
All I do the whole day thru, is dream of you
 
All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing, 
You're every song I ever sing

They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away

Dick Robertson,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1996
Dick Robertson,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,2000

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Calls her on the phone.

Joa, oa, oa, oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""

He creeps up from behind.

Dick Siegel,"What's this jive that you're tryin to tell me?
Do you think that I am someone dumb?
You can't cut twenty inches off my favorite tracks, 
This ain't no Caddy now, I want my money back.

What you think they mean by this downsizing?
It just looks like cheaper to me.
Next they'll take the Liberty Bell
And downsize it's ring
And they'll take you my brother
And downsize your thing
I know if never meant nothin', Jack, 
But they downsized my Cadillac.

Could it be there is some sort of problem?
Could it be that something isn't right?
I was ""Mr. Save-Your-Sermon-For-Sunday-Church"", 
Now I'm ""Mr. Need-Some-Preachin'"" since they
Left me in the lurch.

I don't want to drive around in no Mercedes, 
I don't want to drive around in no Jaguar, 
All's I want's a front row seat where I can
Watch and Slip On Down
I put my hair on backwards, 
My head's been turned around.
You know it never meant nothin', Jack
But they downsized my Cadillac

Well, now, I'm the kinda man, I never had a plan
I never had a thought of woe, 
The worries of the world were incidental.
Eternal optimist, I never got pissed, 
I never sang a sour note, 
But, now I'm getting worried, 
They're messing with something elemental.

Fifty feet will never make a mile, 
Sidewalk puddle'll never be a lake, 
You can strike up a match-head, but you won't get a star, 
You can buy yourself a Caddy now, and all you get's a car.
You know it never meant nothin, Jack, 
But they downsized my Cadillac.

Sharp and shiny, So aristocratic, 
Seats so long, wide and plush, 
Plenty of leg room for me and my friends, 
Now it looks just like a shoebox with chrome underwear
I look in my garage door, there ain't no Caddy there.

Now I'm the kinda guy, I never asked why, 
I never wondered how, 
My personality was carbonated.
I always had a gas, a pleasure and a half, 
I never wore a furrowed brow, 
But, now I'm getting worried, 
My attitude is very dated.

So help me outta my four-star dilemma, 
What you think a guy like me should do?
I can't drive around in no Chevrolet, 
I need a full-size, someone gonna pay
I'm gonna crack my book of dreams and pick my number
Take my chance of life in the lottery.
I'm gonna spread my little pillow underneath that shady tree, 
If you got a plan for something, come and talk to me.

Cause it never meant nothing, Jack
I know it never meant nothing, Jack
I know it never meant nothing, Jack
But they downsized my Cadillac.",Downsize Blues,

As she pass she flashed that come-hither look
The look
That was meant for me and for me alone

The look
Would be out of place in a children's book
The look
That could chip a piece off a heart of stone

Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

Someday if she sashays by you and looks your way
I'd say you'll do well if you overlook the look

It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

Dick Todd,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so

Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me

Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality

Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,
So does the moon in the blue,
All this is mine and heaven too.

You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine

To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Where nothing is ever put straight

And loses herself in her

Lovers walk through in their coats

Pretty in pink, isn't she?

Talk of her notes and the
Flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy, and
Isn't she pretty in pink?

First in the line is the
Last to remember her name
He's walking around in this
Dress that she wore
She is gone, but the
Joke's the same

Pretty in pink, isn't she?

She hands you this coat
She give you her clothes

Special I hear your lonesome whistle whine
Special keep moving me on down the line

My mackinaw's full of holes and ain't too good at keeping out the cold
My shoes are worn as paper thin my feet can feel the cinders through the soles
Sometimes I see a pretty girl wonder what I've missed along the way
Once someone special wore my ring loved me more than anything
I gave her up and caught a train one day
Special I had a special girl on time Special keep moving me on down the line

Dickey Lee,"I saw my lady walking by the river yesterday
She was picking flowers singin' songs of love along the way
Seeing her by moonlight tells me that her hair is shining yellow
Picking daisies nervously waiting by the river for her fellow

All I know it really means I love her

Will she ever leave me she hasn't said she has somebody new
Or will she come and take my hand walk me down along the river too

I haven't got a nickel not one penny can I show
Get off get off you railroad bum and he slammed that boxcar door (yodel)

Dickey Lee,"Where the walker runs down to the Carson Valley Plain
There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed oer the range

Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shone in the night out of Yerrington town

She was courted by Young Vandamere
A fine lad was he as I am to hear
He gave her silver rings and lacy things
And she promised to wed before the snows came that year

But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin touched the hearts of us one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Dickey Lee,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through

Dickey Lee,"Alone until my eighteenth year, we met four springs ago
She was shy and had a fear, of things she did not know
But we got it on together in such a super way
We held each other close at night, and traded dreams each day

She said Rocky I've never been in love before, don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you take my hand I might get through it, through it
I said baby, oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free
And God knows if the world should end your love is safe with me

We found an old gray house, and you would not believe the way
We worked at night to fix it up, took classes in the day
Painting walls and sipping wine, sleeping on the floor
With so much love with just two, soon we found there'd be one more

And she said Rocky I've never had a baby before, don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you, take my hand I might get through it, through it
I said baby, oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free, 
and God knows if the word should end your love is safe with me.

We had lots of problems then, but we had lots of fun
Like the birthday party, when our baby girl turned one
I was proud and satisfied, life had so much to give
Till the day they told me that she didn't have long to live
She said Rocky I never had to die before don't know if I can do it

Now it's back to two again my little girl and I
Who looks so much like her sweet mother, sometimes that makes me cry
I sleep alone at nights again, I walk alone each day
And sometimes when I'm about to give in, I hear her sweet voice say to me

Rocky you know you've been alone before, you know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me, take my hand I'll help you through it, through it.

And God knows if the world should end, your love is safe with me

So lovely and warm, an angel of a girl.
Last night I fell in love with Laurie -
Strange things happen in this world.

As I walked her home,
She said it was her birthday.
I pulled her close and said
""Will I see you anymore?""
Then suddenly she asked for my sweater
And said that she was very, very cold.

I kissed her goodnight
At her door and started home,
Then thought about my sweater
And went right back instead.
I knocked at her door and a man appeared.
I told why I'd come, then he said:

""You're wrong, son.
You weren't with my daughter.
How can you be so cruel
To come to me this way?
My Laurie left this world on her birthday -
She died a year ago today.""

A strange force drew me to the graveyard.

I saw the shadows wave,
And then I looked and saw my sweater
Lyin' there upon her grave.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin' fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the Buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop

This is somethin' I never wanted but since I met you I've been on it
I think about you all the time, can't get you off my mind
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

Thinkin' I'm going all the way, I wanna show you but I'm afraid
I know you say it's all on me, maybe tonight I'll let you see
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me but I like it, I like it

I heard you whisper somethin' to me
Hold me close now, baby don't leave
Emotions taking over, somethin's controllin' me
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

What am I feeling' it's gettin' stronger
And I can't hold it back for much longer
Although we try to be cool, it's all because of you
I know this can't be love but baby it must be love

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me but I like it, I like it

Nah, in a minute I might have to check myself into the psych ward
I'm goin' crazy and I don't know what I'm fightin' for
See it's too easy to run from this
And my mind's sayin' I can't really fuck with this

Try to resist but every passionate kiss blow my mind like a terrorist
You can be mine on some forever shit
I'm intrigued, believe me
Try to be tough but the look in your face is so delectated

It's somethin' you doin', you got me in a trance
You got me ruing and doing shit I ain't used to doin'
Thinkin' 'bout a chance, maybe a slow dance
Maybe we hold hands, fur coats and France

Go diving on beaches with white diamonds in the sand
Then we hand gliding over Cannes
And then you can be my number one fan
And I could be your love in the club for as long as the song lasts

The way you make me feel got me goin' crazy
Tell me what you doin' tonight
I'll be there right away, take a ride with you, home late

Ohh, and you know I'm gonna give you my love
Boy I so glad that you're mine
Do you wanna spend some time with me?

Don't wanna give in to you so easily

Diddy,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man
Word up

On a yacht, nigga fuck a boat that row 

With all this money that we can make 
Why y'all cats want to playa hate? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to?
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
With all this money that we can make 
Why y'all cats want to playa hate? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 

Yo, the reality of it all, everybody can't ball 
If you had currency, you wouldn't be worryin' 'bout me 
But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer 
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, 'cause it's less trouble 
Make my dough and I just stack, no investment 
I live off just that 
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at 
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that 
Why do what most do? Do what you 'possed to 
Make hot jams y'all, sell bicoastal 
If you want a hit you can let me coach you 
Money back on anything that got my vocals 
This is so true, I do what pros do 
'Cause broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through 
Dealers give me credit any place I go to 
Drive out in the Benz say ""Let Mase owe you'""

See, the moral of the story is 
I'm not here to replace Notorious 
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing 
Harlem World style, pursue my dream, 'cause see 
The things that went 3 mil, I didn't even like that 
You say you got mad hoes, well we'll see tonight
Mase be the cat that'll lead you to the light 
Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight 
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block 
That tellin' you that Mase don't rock 
'cause Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht and a big knot
To move you and your moms off the block 
For real though, Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo' 
And since you can't beat us, it's best you join us 
'Cause I know you won't have this hold that's on us 

With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats want to playa hate?

Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties? 
Please, tell me something that I don't know

Got plans to get my Land and my six

Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men

How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way it's hot and hazy,
Never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's, nigga please,
I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come
Get 'em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, enough money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)

Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (hehe)

I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her
Mase want to be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over spilled brunette
Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin', not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high

Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby

Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna, rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out glocks, stop my life (uh)
I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got they trust?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?""
Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hater's Degree? (Ahaha!)

Can't nobody take my pride, can't nobody hold me down oh no
I got to keep on movin'

Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)
Where your chicks at? (where) Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'ma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)

Simply a lot of men be wantin' to hear me
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese, in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (hehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin' out the anus

Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)

When I feel, trapped
Feel there's, no way out
No escape
To be honest, I don't know where my life is goin
Where I'll end up at
I just don't know

I looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice
Stayed away from the bogus, til his rise began
Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest
til he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin
Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin
Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild
Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot
He dream, visualize, plot and scheme
Got the cream legally without the beam
Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0
Jet black tint still, they might know
Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&B
Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks
Heard she do backflips, for niggaz who stack chips
Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo
Real G's makin her back swell
Only givin head to those niggaz who rapped well
Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints
Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more
Two bagged up, four went raw
Back of my mind countin up the big score
Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor
Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore
So far from pure, rotten to the core
Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips
with cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold
to bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice
In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on
Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on
Don't understand they playin wit it
Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it
Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun
I'd release slugs black and bust back
See how these players love that, to the point where
I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it
I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself
And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

I been on this road for a long time now
At time it seems like the road is never gonna end
On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains
Peaks and valleys
Even a lot of potholes on this road
It's never smooth, on the road of life
I don't know where I'm going
I just know where I wanna end up at

Do you know where you're goin to?

Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job

You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand

We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot

Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggaz shit on E, what a pi-ty
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies
Drive a Ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off

At the end of the night they gonna slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Please God let a Bad Boy die old

Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me

So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese

Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand

Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Three course meals spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal

Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
In something European chromed out with a clutch, what

Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme

Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Willona
From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown

German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it

Even the dog can feel the chill
She lays her head down on the table
Next to a stack of unpaid bills
Daddy comes and puts his arms around her
He says ""Girl, your stockings' startin' run
Now it ain't ever been easy
But ain't it always been fun, fun, fun""

We fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it
We fell in love and there's no way out
I said no way

Daddy's cussin' in the backyard
Got the engine hangin' from a tree
Kickin' the tires on the T-Bird
He says, ""T, you ain't gettin' the best of me, not this time""
Mamma comes dancin' out the back door
Snappin' a dish towel in her hand
She says, ""Don't you be wastin' all that good energy
Don't you know how I love a sweaty man-oh-man-oh""

Diddy,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

Honey I keep you hot and wet, just flooded with ice
And you can spend all day and chill, all night
Come sleep with the king, peep what I bring
Every few weeks it's a bigger size ring
Carats ain't nothin' when the cabbage ain't nothin'
I got habits like goin to Paris I ain't frontin'
You can never need for nothin', only one pipe
Would you like to go to dinner, wit Jordan and his wife?
Am I moving fast?  It could happen real soon
Thousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms
You know the dress, that got the party impressed
You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine
I try to address it, but you never get the message
You the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert
I never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop
Till I get her cause I need her, my senorita

Baby come to me
Baby come to me

Her name is Carmen, she live down in Spanish Harlem
And I think I have the key to her secret garden
When I seen her, I used to want to beg her pardon
But I was scared, I ain't really have the heart
And when she walked by, I would panic, even though
I was cool with her pops Lou, the mechanic
Went to school with her brother, that's right
I never could build up the words to express how I loved her
Long hair, pretty face, slim waist
The kind that you marry and take to another place
And exchange vows, spend thous
Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel
She'll be loyal without being spoiled
You can shuck all you want but she's still gonna ignore you
Makes no sense to say mira
Cause bet she won't turn him around, she's my senorita

I rock regular clothes, as well as Gucci too
And if you don't believe me, ask Groovy Loo
You're beautiful, so I stay true to you
I think you oughta see things like Bermuda boo
No cooperation, got me walkin' around pacin'
Patient, waitin' for my day of penetration
Your relationships is bullshit, your man is a prick
With a little bit of bricks and a whip baby
Please, I got plenty of V's
What you want the pink C-2, or the yellow 3-2-5
That's when I opened my eyes
I was dreamin', damn it was all a surprise
But it felt real, I hopped up in a wet chill
Yet still gotta keep this one concealed
Even though I never got a chance to meet her
I still need her, cause she's my senorita

But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin', I'm clappin' your way

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective

But now the Sean-Don keep the (?)

Chorus-Puff Daddy:
Too many people worried about what we got
Everything we drop will be hot
Puff Daddy and the Goodfellas don't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
(2x)

Sheek:
Hey, yo it's crazy we here now every chick want my baby
My career clear while your shit look hazy
Bang with us? I don't think so, we platinum plus
With no airplay so ain't shit for us to discuss
But when we hit, you can't understand how we did it
At home praticin tryin to learn how we spit it
Forty-eight hours of old tea like Nick Nolte
Young but O-G's at this rap shit nigga please
One hit for all of us to start eatin 
And wild stack on three weeks on bowell leather beats
Our parents are sharp like cactuses
And you can tell by chips, we sleep on matresses
Dimes flooded out in the hidous
Shit you see in magazines, cut out we freak them hoes
Drop them clothes, double expose you in the lens
Now relax as we videotape you in the bed

(Chorus 2x)

Jay:
If we talk about dollars, only thing I turn down is my collar
Pull out turn them around, if he reach make him holler
Who runnin the town? The Goodfellas
Puff is the godfather, dog, so why bother?
With the third-person, you might catch me surfin
Money I be jerkin, my newborn be burpin
Can't stop, won't stop, I want respect
And I only bum heads with checks
In the suite with this honey from Bangladesh
Pop a snapple, I (?) lay on my chest
All I had to do was get it there, she doin the rest
Take a L to the head, then we listen to flex
Yes, the black hood, and I mack good
With hydro and chocolate mixed in backwood
Ask yourself, do you rap good or act good?
Baby we ain't gon' stop, but you should

(Chorus)

Diddy,"Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock? Who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped? Who copped the blue drop?
Who's jewels got rocks? Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?

Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales pulling all the love
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Nigga didn't know me ninety-one, bet they know me now
I'm the young harlem nigga with the goldie sound

And a team much stronger than yours,
Violate me this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around be D.O.A., be on your way

A lot of ups and downs
Made a lot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend

You're the love of my life
You're everything to me
You never left my side
You're my best friend
I love you so much
Yes, you are
You're my best friend

Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?

Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen

Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright

My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you

Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, God is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs

Life as we know it, it all begins with Him
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him

Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour

Looked me in the eyes and ask, ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out

Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him, ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said, ""Manifest the great""

All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me

At the media party. He was pronounced dead on arrival.
No suspects have been taken into custody.

Combs' trouble seems to continue as he turned himself
In today to local police for an alleged assault and
Battery charge. He posted bail and was released on

In my distress I prayed to the Lord
And the Lord answered and rescued me
The Lord is for me so I will not be afraid
What can mere mortals do to me
Yes the Lord is for me
He will help me
I will look in triumph at those who hate me
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes
Though hostle nations surrounded me
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
They swarmed around me like bees
They blazed against me like roaring flames
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
The Lord is my strength and my song
He has become my victory
Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do",Forever (Intro),1999

Diddy,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on
I do, satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
so now my sight is gettin dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
but wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed

Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile

Buy the cassette, rewind it to death
Alota y'all sweat it, you try to forget
How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz
I'm why you smell herb in the crib
Man I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful
Indo out-do, intro to outro

I'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique
Them niggas y'all look up to is on my dick
Sauce motherfuckin' born to hit
I get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit
Look, you against me is really nothin' to see
Who, when, where, what it's gon' be
I don't give a fuck if it's he or she
I'm the virgin of hip hop
Nobody fuckin' with me
I know your type, you a ride dick nigga
Cry sick nigga, lied quick nigga
Out of turn speakin', first one leakin'
Always the Suzuki side kick nigga
Bitches don't cast stones down, they throw bricks
Why I come through and tell 'em to blow dick
These nigga's the nicest?  No, go fish
Sauce, you da best motherfucker, no shit

You're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated
Observe it from over there, ok 
Ain't It obvious we overheated
You talkin' that slick shit 
But I jus' know that you meant me 
But evidently, you don't know
I get your ass gone permanently
It ain't complex
I'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next
Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up
And nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up
Look in my eyes, I'm not scared
Sucka, you heard what I said
If you don't wanna get dead
No it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla
The mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule

Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song
(Bitch nigga)
You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit
Zap nigga's like cellular flips and swell up your lips
Fuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house

Diddy,"Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me; this is what I am

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin' ""that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G
People warn me, when you're on top, there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)

Talkin' that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggas baggin' joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't nothin' shook
About them, I doubt them cats waitin' for me
You know them niggas, them big dudes across the street
She say, ""Yeah, they from over on Mayfair""
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out
This bitch over them with them pointin' the chief out
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, I'ma show 'em how Black play
Roll the dice, fuckin' with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto

I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin' honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
You's about to get, fucked with no jail

Fill one of they chests with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in
In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin'

Just like that she was gone, now it's over

When night falls - that's when it all begins
Be prepared; we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend y'all bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm like I'm nervous
Live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Start'n conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in their black magic
Suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready?  Don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti

Leave all the does behind that act iffy

Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath

I told you that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill 
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till it's done
See, I got guns, and I'm sick
See how you said meet me here, and I came quick?
Them same cats on the most wanted list
We can hit them, then straight disappear in the mist
...Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill, and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile; break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening, and, but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work

And watch how they all fall flat

Who know and understand there ain't a thing sweet about me

Pack toast but still catch him with the backhand steel

I leave rap in a state of shock
Where to rock, from the figures still
Play the block with my niggas
Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush
Still stack chips galore
Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw
Better know that everything I love - roll back
Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew
Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga
You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'
I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother
Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker
My wrists cluster, on a mobile
P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop
Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques
I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga

Try to see if you see what I see
Give my game & spit my G
When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one
On top is where I be
Tell me, do you see what I see?

Do you see what I see?

Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it
This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated
Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it
Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1
Niggas want to bite off my flow son
I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track
Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw
Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?
BK forever representin' my borough
Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips
Too easy for you to understand my hits
When the album drops every pocket hold some
Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son
Hypnotic, heard the ? war 'fore I shot it
Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it

Diddy,"I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word girl it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife

I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Winter time and the fall lives snow white
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I used to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

[Faith]
I'll tell you why there's no love
Simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us
Don't you know you lost my trust?
People ask me where you've been
And I tell them we're just friends
'Cause it's so obvious
That it's never gonna work for us

Played with my emotions
You gets no devotion
And you gets no love, gets no love
You can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it 
Will come back to you

I'll tell you why we can't hook up
'Cause I had about enough
Of hearing all the lies you tell
Boy I thought I knew you well

People think that you're my man
They don't even understand
Just because I let's you get love
Don't make you the one
We ain't even in love
You know that you played

Played with my emotions
You gets no devotion
And you gets no love, gets no love
You can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend
And you gets no love again
Whatever you do it 
Will come back to you

You better rock my shit
Don't knock my shit
Because I got that shit
To make you cop my shit 
You better rock my shit
Don't knock my shit
Because I got that shit
That make you cop my shit 
I'm the diva with clout
Everybody rap about
Check it out rhymes I' bust 'em
Problems with my life don't discuss 'em

Played with my emotions
You gets no devotion
And you gets no love, gets no love
You can get no love from me
You can't even be my friend

Booties dancin' 'round a nigga and I'm killin' one
Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm fuckin with this chick,
with a phat body and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you
You's a real bad girl, a nigga need that
Sippin' on ya Henny, askin' where the weed at

Had me singin' ""I'm sorry Ms. Jackson""

I love the way it's goin down she got the thong on
She started bouncin more once she heard the ""Thong Song""
Them high heels got them calves lookin' right too
Shorty come live with me for the night true
Shit I'm only tryin to holla, it's only right you holla back
So where you headed lemme follow that
Now word up I got plans for you
It's more than my tongue and my hands'll do
The way you move to the music - it make a nigga want to,
take you up outta here, go somewhere, loose it
And your physique is off the chain
It's gonna be hard gettin you off the brain

And I'm hopin' that it's you that a nigga get
Hear them callin' out ya name, I geuss ya showtime
Get'cha money shorty, lemme see you pole climb
Toes out, back showin' off the tat-toooo
Fuck the dumb shit, a nigga had to snatch youuuu
Lookin as good as ya smell, pay your own bills
Ask officer, 'cause your pushin' your own wheels
Yea I'm feelin' you tryin' to see the deal with you
What's goin' on, later on, can I chill with you?
We can do anything that you want to do
You know the way a nigga feel, all I want is you
Get ya dance on

Here we go again

Back together again
Let's go Mary

All the love we gave
The loving that we made
Then you went away (that's right)
So I had to pray
See a brighter day
Cause silence let us pray
Now I'm moving on to get away from all this pain

I feel (I feel)
Better than I felt before (so much better)
Cause there's no more drama knocking at my door

Better than I felt before
Cause there's no more drama in my life no more
No More
No More
No More

I like this, come'on

It's looking better now
A brand new love I found
I finally figured out
What love is all about
And now I'm on my way
And all I have to say
Is there'll be no crying and I truly believe that

[Chorus]

It's time
To realize (people it's time)
It's up
To you and I
Love is what you make it
If you don't give up the fight
All this really means
Assuring me
Believe in all you dream

I don't think they ready for this one

Yo it's the D I D again, D to the weezy
Been in the game twelve years it ain't easy
Been in dem things got game that so breezy
Spendin' them things with a chain that's so freezy
Please believe me, TV need me
As far as the CD, pump that on GP
What's the 411 hun, it's PD
M-J-B collabo with B-B
Period, no question no comma
Your hearing is no vest and no armor
Bring it to cats like Bush to Osama
Sippin' on vu, make moves and no scama
Word to my mama
Can't deal with the trama
That why a nigga stay in the Bahamas
Laying in pajamas
Two sexy mamas
Bodyguards, topguns, two extra lamas
I don't want no drama

No more, no more, no more
No more drama y'all

Matta-fact, get'cha facts straight (Say whaaat?!)
Nino Brown without the high fate
O-Dog without the O, Nigga you don't know?
Sonny Coleon, Godfather get loose

You gonna pay the price if you ever fuck me
It's like rollin dice, if you try an duff me

When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans
The top story, evening news
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dogs ain't there

I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me
Pop bottles, models, be all on me
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be
Front on me and see where you all gon' be

One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?

Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you goin' actually learn

But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Make the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Cause I came too far
For me to be bouswar
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I'm trying to see you work it out girl
(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I wanna see you work it out girl

Now hold up, stop, wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning
Got asian women
That'll change my linen
After I done blazed and hit em
But I just wanna rock wit you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo
I got an agenda
Got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it girl
I just wanna see you shake it girl
For the return of the don
The world in my palm
My mom calls me Sean
But y'all call me

I didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would have had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild, now these days that I reminisce
About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)

Some in it for the love and some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low

'Cause I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale

Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him

me picture this (picture this) you only have to use yo' mind
What you know good (you know good)
It's your world and I'm just in it (what?)
It's just the way that God must have meant it
Speak of the man

[Chorus]

[MJG]
Pimp tight! M-J-G
Fin' to get up on the mic with a passion
Get up on some pads Gwen, my chick get her ass in
For the track, make my money
Bring it on back to the middle of the floor
I want the whole stack
Plus I, need a little more, I gotta eat a little mo'
My seed gotta grow
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show
What I mean is I go
off like a champ, when I cling to the floor
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dipping
Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

Diddy,"[P. Diddy]
Yeah can you hear me? Yeah
There's certain things in life that you can stop
and there's certain things in life that can't be stopped
Let's go

""And now, for your, bad bad boys, starting at guard""

[P. Diddy]
why y'all niggas still talking?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

[G. Dep]
This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you living an illusion, living in a used one
while I'm in the Limited, cruising
You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said, I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

[Loon]
Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

[Black Rob]
Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice
the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga

[P. Diddy]
We'll never stop..
We'll never stop..
One of the greatest teams that ever lived..
It's like in our blood..
We gotta be born this way..

One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of

And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing

He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks

Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops

Diddy,"I know a honey named Millie, raised out in Philly
Body so illy she make a grown man silly
A brainiac really she pretend she dilly
Like, ""Why you always look at me like that, you feel me?""

There's a girl named Wendy, love black Bentley's
Nails in her mouth, stay tryin' to tempt me
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty

Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy
Let's just say she has a problem bein' choosy
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi
On the celly with her man, ""Love you, I'm at the movies""

Bird named Chyna (baby where you find her)
Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her

So after school, I take a dip in the pool
Which is really, on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see, the Knicks play basketball
And we talkin' bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money
Than a sucker, could ever spend
But I couldn't give a what about them cats you with
Get your friends baby, jump in the Benz

I got a judge named Donna, I call her Your Honor
Whylin' out with the gavel and the silk pajamas (let's go)

And then there's Tamika, the sergeant gets deeper
She turned the bass way up and wind on the speaker
Girl named Kelly, rhinestones in her belly
Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly

Can you feel it? nothin' can save ya

Everybody go, I want to rock right now

Cause we get crazy, I mean outrageous
You rollin' with us? 
You rollin' with flavor

Ask Penny, I call her Good'n'Plenty (why?)
Cause after the show, there's nothin' open but Denny's (oh yeah)
Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley

Little Shaniqua, from Massapequa
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her, anyway

When you talk about Diddy and L
You talk about careers that's hard to kill
The whole entire globe recognize the grill
Walkin down the red carpet we're chilly chill!

I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word girl it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Winter time and the fall lives snow white
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I used to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride

Diddy,"When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

And how I had a trifilin' mental
So ride with me, G-Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

Listen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas, Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad

But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened a lot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean bless it
So why listen to her and start guessin'?

I need affection

Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!

There's somethin' leakin' in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me, always getting weak,

Aye yo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as we're here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to St.Tropez?
Or seened a brotha play a Mandalay?
Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin', I love you girl
