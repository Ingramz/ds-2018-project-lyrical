Ron Goodwin,"No, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Ron Goodwin,"I believe for every drop of rain that falls 
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone that goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe
I believe
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf
Or see the sky
Then I know why

Ron Goodwin,"I would walk behind you 
on your wedding day
and I'll hear you promise to love and obey
Though you may forget me you're still on my mind
Look over your shoulder I'm walking behind

Maybe I'll kiss again with a love that is new
That I shall wish again I was kissing you
Cos I always love you wherever you row
We could have been happy like Dabby and Joe
So if things go 

Unkind look over your shoulder I'm walking behind",Theme From Limelight,2012

Ron Goodwin,"Do you know the way to San Jose?
I've been away so long. I may go wrong and lose my way.
Do you know the way to San Jose? 
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.

L.A. is a great big freeway. 
Put a hundred down and buy a car. 
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years. How quick they pass 
And all the stars that never were 
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They've got a lot of space. There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.

Fame and fortune is a magnet.
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone.
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend 
You pack your car and ride away

Ron Goodwin's Orchestra,"First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

Too young to really be in love
They say that loves a word

And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at all

Close to you

On the day that you were born

Ron Goodwin's Orchestra,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Is in your eyes

Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go

One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after

But all I do is cry

(Cry, cry, no more laughter) I should be happy

Since he left my life's so empty

Though I try to forget it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him

For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

I delight in your love,

Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

That I would rather be.

We're making love or in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue

But then it feels so good  I knew it would
You know the way to make me crazy
I want to give it to you

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

You take me high and low  you know
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
You're such a mystery to me

But baby hot or cold, you got a hold
Of my imagination
I think you know what i mean

You make me feel so emotional

Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Well I begin the weekend with a groove roll about eight deep now
What's my next move
Wait until night fall so I could enjoy systems
Pump by four Jeeps
running like a convoy roll to the club
Kind of crowded
What a scene
pulling up with Jodeci
Blasting out the fifteen
So I park my ride 
Girls see my gear and notice my grill
Here comes the pointing and staring

Take a few flicks
Order Dom Perignon and lay back with my chicks
Mike is on the left of me

Tricky and Moet are on the dance floor ripping
Silk is with a cutie
Big D, I'm trying to find him
Tim is in the front and
Mo'Bettas right behind
and me I'm just laying on the prowl
Guys say what's up as the girls cry aaaahhh
She grabbed her man
I think she tried to play'em
My only thought was to step to the a.m.
'Cause I came to have a good time
and at the end of the night
No doubt I'm gonna get mine
'Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain if you know what I mean
understand I'm not conceded

this type of night is rare
I glance to the right
Oh, who do we have here
Puff and stew gettin' ripped
What the hell
I see Mr. Uptown himself, Andre Harrell
conversating 
with his boys
as they start to barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mello, so I leap to sista' and the soul
rollin' five deep
Mark, Corey, Shakim, L.Q. doin' the wild thing
'cause the soul is true
And every time I hear the music thump-id-dee-thump
and all the girlz gettin' bucked right in your rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor

Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1993
Ron Holloway,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there
