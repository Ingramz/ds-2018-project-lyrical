William Ash,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady take a lesson from me
I can help you be what you want to be
Together we'll see many brighter days
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone",Sophisticated Lady,2004
William Ash,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004
William Ash,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2004
William Ash,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",2004
William Ash,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun,2005
William Aura,"Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space,
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree, 
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
Give a smile, from your lips, and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way",Fantasy,1988
William Austin,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon,1958
William Austin,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?",Lover Man,1958
William Baldé,"On vit sous les toits
C'est petit mais c'est chez moi
Quand la nuit tombe et qu'il fait froid
Alors elle se sert tout contre moi

Il fait beau
On est bien comme ça
Et c'est chaud
Quand elle s'oublie dans mes bras

Moi j'ai pas le sou
Libre comme l'air tu vois
Avec un sourire je suis riche de toi
Moi j'ai pas le sou
Libre comme l'air tu vois
Tant qu'on a l'envie on est riche de soi

On court après quoi?
Moi dans la vie je cours après toi

William Baldé,"Je m'éloigne, j'ai la peau tatouée,
J'emmène mon âme, j'y laisse mes pieds,
Tout me manque ici-bas, j'ai le corps étranger,
Tout au fond de moi, qu'est-ce qui va rester,
C'est comme un jeu, une partie se joue,
Le froid griffe mes yeux, l'air caresse ma joue,
Mon cœur se peint en bleu, les liens qui se dénouent
J'oublie juste un peu, je suis loin de tout.

On a beau faire des détours,
On y revient, on y revient toujours
On a beau faire des détours,
On y reviendra un jour...

L'avion se pose, autour on m'envie,
On me respecte, et on se méfie,
Je n'ai plus la tête d'un enfant du pays,
Personne ne me rejette, déjà je m'enfuis,
Je perds le goût de ces choses d'avant,
Je ne sais plus du tout, sans personne devant
J'ai les genoux qui tremblent, je sens de temps en temps,
Une frontière un peu floue qui pertube mes enfants...

Tout au creux de ma main
Cette épine plantée...
Toujours le même refrain
Qui ne fait que tourner...
Ou je suis trop loin, ou je suis trop près...",En Corps Étranger,2008
William Baldé,"Envie d'être bien besoin de calme,
Loin d'ici de ce vacarme
Qui ne rime à rien...
Les gens là-bas
Dansent toute la journée,
Un sentiment de légèreté
Pour qui sonne le glas...

Je veux faire le tour de la terre,
Vivre des traversées du désert...
Une île au milieu de l'eau,
Le coin de paradis qu'il me faut !

Partir loin...
Me sentir à ma place,
Avoir l'audace,
Cet exil sera le mien.
Comme un sadhu
J'irai tôt ou tard,
Un refuge à Zanzibar
Un thé à Kathmandu...

En territoire inconnu
Je me sens dans ma rue,
Au-delà des ports
Je ne perds jamais le nord
Bien que la misère s'y reflète
C'est la vie qui s'entête...",Exil,2008
William Baldé,"J'abuse de telles ruses
Tu penses que je m'amuse,
Dans les yeux ma muse
Tu refuses mes excuses,
Tu as l'âme d'un sage
Esquive, rotative
Pour gagner la rive
Tu tournes la page...

No more again,
Même rengaine
Not even more,
Mais encore...
No more again,
Même rengaine
Not even more...

S'enflammer pour si peu
C'en est de trop
Une simple goutte d'eau
Pour attiser le feu...
Tu as l'âme sauvage
Furtive, émotive
La silhouette vive
Devient un mirage

Je te juge, tu m'estimes,
Je m'insurge, tu t'indignes,
Je t'attise, tu résistes,
C'est la crise...

So sweet and so kindly
Where baby's gone
I was certainly wrong
Now she's gone...

No more again,
Même rengaine
Not even more,
Mais encore...
No more again,
Même rengaine
Not even more...",No More Again,2008
William Baldé,"Un rayon de soleil
Dort sur tes cheveux longs
Sur nos corps de seigle
Et nous joue du violon

Un rayon de soleil
Sur le sommeil de plomb
Une guitare sèche
Nous ride à la maison

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un rayon de soleil
J'embrasse tes pieds sales
Un disque de Marley
Joue ""No woman, no cry""
No woman, no cry

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Par la fenêtre ouverte
L'air que nous respirons
Ses petites poussières
Si pâles d'émotion

Un rayon de soleil
Sur ton si beau visage
Aux abeilles se mêle
La voix de Bob Dylan

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un rayon de soleil
Tu te rhabilles pour de bon
Je te ramène par les tresses
A mon corps de garçon

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin

Un matin suspendu
Aux fleurs de ton jardin
Ma main sur ton petit cul
Cherche le chemin",Rayon de Soleil,2008
William Baldé,"Quarante-cinq degrés
Et pas le moindre buisson,
Un enfant aux yeux sombres
M'indique la direction...
Ma japonaise prête au carton,
Je mets les gaz pour le nord,
Je suis là pour l'action
Et l'abandonne à son sort...

Sur la route de Dakar
Des souvenirs à la pelle
Hantent les semelles
Des coureurs, dans le brouillard...
Sur la route de Dakar
On croise la nature humaine,
Qu'est-ce que la vie d'un p'tit Noir
Que le monde voyait à peine ?!..

Chaque jour je manque
De justesse un gamin
Quand le convoi s'ébranle
Au son des tam-tams africains !
Dans le bruit et la poussière
Tant pis les accidents,
Les femmes trémoussent leur derrière
En roulant des yeux blancs...

Après plusieurs semaines
Sur cette terre de palu,
Aux chefs à grosses bedaines
Aux gosses aux pieds nus,
Je maudis la latérite
De mes nombreuses embardées
Le moral en faillite,
Je regrette la terre des nuits étoilées",Sur La Route de Dakar,2008
William Baldé,"Peine perdue dans ma vie
La p'tite Suzy est partie,
Quand elle a dit ""c'est fini"",
J'ai pleuré sous la pluie
On aurait pu être heureux
Essayer de vivre à deux...
De tous les loups, les agneaux,
C'est moi qu'elle avait choisi
Mais la vie derrière les rideaux
Ça n'était pas son envie,
A trop vouloir la protéger
Je n'avais pas tout envisagé...

Et on m'a toujours dit Suzy
Tu ne veux plus d'homme dans ta vie
Trop de déceptions, de soucis,
Trop de conflits...
Mon Dieu si tu savais Suzy,
J'ai si souvent dans ma vie
Cherché l'image de ton sosie
L'image Suzy, de ton sosie...

Sur le mur dans l'entrée
Il y a toujours ton portrait,
On sent partout ton parfum
Ton ombre erre dans les coins,
Rien qu'un chagrin ordinaire
Qu'est-ce que ça peut bien faire ?
T'aurais pu attendre un peu
Me laisser soigner tes bleus...
Le jour de la confidence
J'ai compris ta souffrance,
Hommes et femmes tu as aimés
Tu n'as jamais pu te décider...

Sous mon toit déserté
Dans le métro sur un quai,
Où que soit mon errance
C'est toujours à toi que je pense...",Suzy,2008

William Beckett,"My life's these yellow lines, concrete, and parliament butts
Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks
Load in, sound check, play show, load out, let's go, next city, oh great, off day
Hangovers, hangups, dial backs, running make up, apologies and promises
And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad
But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have
I'm putting miles on my body; 'bout due for a tune up in this gas station
Food ain't really helping, but I'm loving every minute
Every road sign's a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with

[Chorus]
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in seven weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again

I like these hotels, passports, random bag checks
Day dreams of love affairs that I haven't had yet
Touch down, baggage claim, new town, different dame
Same clothes, seven days, whew; damn, I need to change
And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend
Wildin' out on a level Nic Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here)
We made a lot of friends and even more enemies
Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be
Soft raving baby, life's lovely
Even when the gray rain cloud's right above me
The girl's textin' me, talkin' about gettin' all cuddly
'Cause you paint a pretty picture, but the frame is so ugly

[Chorus]

And now it's back in a van with four of my mans
Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands
I feel like tourin' this land's made me more of a man
From killa California to the shores of Japan
Good times stayin' up late in Austin
Coast to coast V8 to Chicago
To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston
And smokin' that most great eight in Colorado
Home ain't home no more
I hug the road and kiss the concrete, and sometimes I even hear her heartbeat
No matter where we go or where we at
We carry upstate on our back; it's like that

[Chorus x 2]

'So, a lot of you don't realize there's a whole subculture of boys driving around in vans.'
Even if we don't look back again
'...Looking for your daughters, and your lottery tickets. Love it or leave it; I'm like this.'
Even if we don't look back again
'I love my life, bitches.'
Even if we don't look back again
Even if we don't look back again",7 Weeks,2006
William Beckett,"Ha ha ha, this is about you

Beware, beware, be skeptical
Of their smiles, their smiles of plated gold
Deceit so natural
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning

Bla-bla-black sheep, have you any soul?
No sir, by the way, what the hell are morals
Jack, be nimble, Jack, be quick
Jill's a little whore and her alibis are dirty tricks

So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

Aware, aware, you stalk your prey
With criminal mentality
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on
Infecting everyone, you're quite the problem

Feefifofum, you better run and hide
I smell the blood of a petty little coward
Jack, be lethal, Jack, be slick
Jill will leave you lonely dying in a filthy ditch

So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

Maybe you'll change
Abandon all your wicked ways
Make amends and start anew again
Maybe you'll see
All the wrongs you did to me
And start all over, start all over again

Who am I kidding
Now, let's not get overzealous here
You've always been a huge piece of shit
If I could kill you I would
But it's frowned upon in all fifty states
Having said that, burn in hell

So tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

Karma's gonna come collect your debt
Karma's gonna come collect your debt",Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,2014

Wisconsin bound

The king of the Memphis sound

Cause now he ain`t around

He died with his guitar
Close to his hands
But his soul lives on today
In the heart of a million fans

Of that wonderful kiss.
I knew that a boy
Could never have more joy
From any little miss.

I remember it quite,
'Twas a wonderful night.

Oh, how I'd adore it
If you would encore it.

Sigh again,
Fly again to heaven.
Baby, see
It's A, B, C,
I love you and you love me.
I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, Baby;

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't

Come true, baby,
My heart begins to hum,

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.

I can't see that at all,
True love never should pall.

I was only teasing;
What you did was pleasing.
Oh,

Do, do, do
What you've done, done, done

William Bolcom,"All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice. 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",I'll Build a Stairway To Paradise,

Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?

Isn't it a crime!

Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!

But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day,1988
William Bolcom,"I've been a soldier quite a while

They all love me
It's very lovely but

Oh! How I hate to get up in the morning
Oh! How I'd love to remain in bed

For the hardest blow of all 
Is to hear the bugler call
Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up
Ya gotta get up this morning

Someday I'm going to murder the bugler
Someday they're going to find him dead

I'll amputate his reveille
And step upon it heavily
And spend the rest of my life in bed

You and the song are gone

They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel

I know things seem messed up sometime
You stressed out and you can't handle the situation
Sometime it feels like you lacking the guidance

And keep in mind that he always loves you,
It's what it is, that's right sugar love

Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like Tabasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infatuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's goin' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching

[Chorus]

[Trife Da God]
She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

Come on

Yo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?
Her little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world
Trying to make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

Up all night, under the party lights
Same old popping and party hopping
All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road
Leading you back to crack, it's a known fact

I'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down
I'll be there, when you falling down (sooner or later)",Josephine,2006

I am the wind that breathes on the sea
I am the wave, wave on the ocean
I am the ray, the eye of the sun
I am the tomb, cold in the darkness

Who but I can cast light upon the meeting of the mountains?
Who but I will find the place where hides away the sun?

I am a star, the tear of the sun
I am a wonder, a wonder in flower
I am the spear as it cries out for blood
The word of great power
I am the wind that breathes on the sea

Who but I can cast light upon the meeting of the mountains?
Who but I will cry aloud the changes in the moon?
Who but I will find the place where hides away the sun?

I am the depths of a great pool
I am the song of the blackbird
I am wind that breathes on the sea

Who but I will cry aloud the changes in the moon?
Who but I will find the place where hides away the sun?

William Earl Branch,"[Chorus]
One day I won't cry no more
Can't wait for the day when people won't die no more
Daddy's won't say, bye no more; lie no more
In the streets bullets won't fly no more

Won't feel no pain no more
Won't have to push, pull, won't have to strain no more

Won't have to walk lame no more
Won't have to play the game no more.

One day we takin off baby and ever since the Lord saved me
I've been waitin for the day we can say, it's all gravy
It's all crazy tryin seeing to see life when its all hazy
How can I persist to do right when I'm all lazy?
Feel me? Too much pain it all ails me
Vexed, cause I can feel the effects of the Fall daily
The pain in my chest it strong, let's get on
Come Lord, quick, bring on the eschaton
End the search, start the new earth, flex your true worth
Honor your Son, let Him come, perfect the new birth
And We don't gotta prove that God is cool
Just know when God is through no more godless rule
So I'm anxious to praise the Ancient of Days
My brain's still amazed at how I can see that pain is a phase
Soon to be eclipsed at the Son's return
When we get what He gives and not what we've earned

[Chorus]

There's coming a day that'll be much better than now
No more hurts. no more work by the sweat of your brow
No more drunk drivers drivin all out of control
No more flats and being stuck on the side of the road
Believe me, no more turning on the T.V
Seeing kids say, for the price of coffee you can feed me
In fact, no more anthrax in the mail
No jail, no blizzards, no twisters, no hail
It'll be the end of rain and the end of planes
Being hijacked and flown into window panes
It'll be nice just, imagine a world that'll be righteous
No more Middle East crisis
No more drugs, and no more thugs and pimps
No more beat-downs, and no more getting mugged for timbs
No need for ramps cause no need for wheel chairs
No need for weaves cause you'll feel your real hair

[Chorus]

One day when this life is over we will live forever
together with our king

Christ is the Rock and believe me the Rock's steady
He drops heavy, so stop screaming I'm not ready
God said He's coming like a thief kid so peep it
He'll creep it's meant to be unknown like a secret
This is what many are having beef with
Gods rotisserie style can make a brothers teeth grit
Cause He's quick but according to our concept of speed
Looking at man He thought about the depth of our need
So what this means is, He's not slow, the King is
Waitin to bring kids into Christ where real Bling is
So they can sing His praise because they've seen this
God spill His blood to show love at its zenith
He proved He cut for them
Look what He gave up for them
Paid His life since you can't pay bucks for sin
Justice then teamed up with long suffering
Big ups to Him who gave you and me time to trust in Him

Heavy shoulder
Your feet tied to the floor

Reminisce of sweet addiction
Strings you never tied

And stillness come
And lay your head

Beside a better burden

Short duration

Port of entry
The living for the numb

You are the blood in my chest
The bird gathering nest
The sea which won't rest

Though I am a broken thing

In morning to hide my face

Let me fall through the ground
Where you fell back to you
We burn like centralia
Lost in the ash below
Hoping to find a home

Forgetting all the blood we drew

But what I do remember
What I do remember is you
What I do remember

And I will look for you, til they put us both back in the ground
And I will call for you

Weren't you looking nice the young boy that you count for dead
I wonder how much you regret that they got me away from you

A broken fool with lover's smile
She, the risen sea
Her, the shallow breath I breathe

Like a dog I run
She, the rabbit chased in one
Through a field of trees
Lost away was lost on me

Should I hold on

She, the rising, both will fall
To the cold return
And no longer for her I burn

There's an elemental bond with us that won't be found, but you're in my heart.

I can hear the sound so faint falling through the floor, as she lets you go.
There's a quality of pain for you she will endure. 
The measures out here.

When you waiting, wonder why without a map to steer, I will comfort you.
When you find the other side, I will still be here to measure out my love.

There's better living

Long as freedom grows
I want to seek it
If it's yes or no
It's me who'll speak it
'Cause the lord, He knows
That this is heaven to me

If you've got your hands
And got your feet
To sing your song
All through the street
You raise your head
When night is done
Shout your thanks up to the sun

I'm the boss of the fam, I need to watch my position

A weak link in the team, in the chain of combustion
Don't trust her, love is for suckas

Stand butt-naked in the storm, sippin' the frosty
Force me to choose, I'mma follow my heart
She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart

I don't wanna be your vessel any more
These are my words, this is my mouth
I don't wanna be your vessel now

At the door of my house
I don't wanna be your vessel any more
I don't wanna be a vessel of your doubt

Truly I never dreamt
Of all the dumb accoutrement
I would want for myself
For the shelf

I laid it all at your feet
On your neck and your cheek

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Through those clouds

For too soon the summer sun, will be in a winter sleep
And hold the sunbird in your hands
Don't let him sing too sweet
For too soon the summer sun, will be in a winter sleep

Inside your winter coat
But leave your troubles behind, now
You wrap yourself in a ball
Then hide away from it all
But let the sunbird in your heart

And hold the sunbird in your hands

For too soon the summer sun, will be in a winter sleep
And hold the sunbird in your hands
Don't let him sing too sweet

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim

I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,

'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

You gotta learn to live again

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

William Jansen,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

William Jennings,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,

Amigo ella y yo
Solos nos vemos a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño, ser su protector
Somos su marido, ella y yo

Oye Don lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Oye mi pana lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu, no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Mi esposa y yo, somos felices dos almas matrices se lo que es el amor
Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada no 
Te alejes por temor, no lo hagas Don, oh no no no

Mi amigo ella y yo teníamos claro que era una locura esta relación
Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacia una invitación
A solo hacer el amor

Ay ya te explique
Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer,
Y ya el marido entiende que perdió su hembra ahora es tu mujer, 
No pueden ganar los tres

Y te repito lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

No seas tan tonto lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Amigo pido perdón yo nunca te falle,
Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer,
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender,
Pues tu también llegaste a ese lugar,
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer

Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer

Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez 
Ya que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía 
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga
Me mintió, tu y ella en una cama, haya en Bayamo
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuantos hoteles ensucio,
Tu también, los odio a los dos

Que yo soy quien mas sufro con todo esto,
Me mata el dolor

Fue una traición

Perdí un amigo por la tentación
Perdón

Me cogí un caso y apuntaron el deo
Ya no era el rey del perreo
Ahora era tecato y otro posible reo
Que me metieran preso dos dijeron mal lo veo
Yo no les creo a su sistema de reformación ingrato
A mi me arrestaron dos puercos por pasar el rato
Y yo aquí pichando aguantando
Callando si nadie es perfecto de que me están juzgando
Y hace con mi vida lo que cualquiera puede
Vivir como quiere, tener sus placeres, mi gente
Yo no distinto a ustedes
Y hoy en dia soy cantante porque ustedes quieren
Me dieron las primeras planas
Cojen rapero con marihuana, pistola y cosa rara
Solo quedara en su mente clara
Cuando crezcan donde yo crecí se críen donde me criaba

And I bought her a home with a view
I took her to the end of the rainbow
But all I left her was blue

Seems I never had time to love her
And now it seems time just stands still

But I was only a fool on the hill

Now, I'm here alone after leavin' her lonely
Lord, I'm livin' with a memory, I know, I can't kill

William Lorin,"Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
Them see a bright new shining star
Them hear a choir sing
The music seemed to come from afar

Now, Joseph and his wife, Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
Them find no place to born she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

By and by, they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark

And man will live forevermore

There's me, the embodiment of how slow life can be.
There's me.

We learn until we're dead.
Be losers til your sanguine thoughts subside.
We learn until we're dead.
A falling dream's not just a morbid sign.
It's opportunity.

A more fashionable vice to lean on.
Some better words to speak on that escaped my younger form.

William McDowell,"I will make myself, a mile from the racetrack, drag my losses home.
It kills me not come back.
And we float with parasites all our lives.
There's me with the geriatrics at the slot machines.
There's me, the embodiment of how slow life can be.
There's me. 
Their dead eyes are glowing. Mine are always shut.
I passed out on the road, just hours from the racetrack.
I saw Lamotta raise a toast.

He said ""you got me with the right jab.""

And we float with parasites all our lives with this advice
We learn until we're dead.
Be losers til your sanguine thoughts subside.
We learn until we're dead.
A falling dream's not just a morbid sign.
It's opportunity.

If you could make this old heart young again I'd find another topic to drone on,
A more fashionable vice to lean on.
Some better words to speak on that escaped my younger form.
But there's me with the geriatrics at the slot machines.

There's me. 
The embodiment of how slow life can be.
There's me. 
Short of imposing, please be involved.
Can I stop imploding at every obstacle thrown on me?
Imply this is only a prettier glimpse of a life so ugly that's mine.","The Sound, Pt. 2",2011

And I don't wear cheap cologne

I'll smell that honky tonk in her hair

Sit on the couch and do nothing but hurts

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

William Orbit,"Falling from the western shore to find yourselves alone again,
Wondering where you have been, Your lonely voice calls
across the starlit coast, Reaching out to be seen.

[Chorus:]
She cries your name,
three times again,
She cries your name,
How long can this love remain.

Cut beneath the surface screen of what we say and what we
seem, Is a trick to be seen, She keeps crying out your name,
But her scream sound the same, How fickle fate can be.

[Chorus]

Birds that scream for territory can learn to sing
euphorically, Give him time an' he's real, And there's a
wasteland in your soul the burned out trees will leave you
cold, Living out an ideal.

Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love

William Patrick Corgan,"I'll go under if you go too
Ripped from the sun, yet born anew
You make it so, you make it known
I'll pace these steps with you
Waiting on a teardrop to explode
Be thorn, be hope, be monstrous
Right there where you are
Take flight, take fear, say ""all good night, now!""
Right from sleepy hour
Faith has its fire and with it, form
I speak of love, impressed with the fluff
What lies beyond mere days
But far beyond, God waits

The angel strikes beast as any man
On pillored fire come out of ash
I scribed your tome, I aim what strove
To rail against proof
Twistin' round our teardrop as it explodes
Take flight, take fear
Rake slumber right from sleepy eye
Be thorn, be hope, be monsters all
As if there's no desire
I weep for love and it's surreal

A droll dance

Sure, we're gonna make it alone

The opry bests, the vested gears
Since ghosts tend to wait on home to do their bleeding

Stake the races that roll pure dynamos
Servile like potters, the vanquished boast
Of everyone that's carried back

Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!",Doodlin',1957

(Do it to me now)

Come let's make a change or leave the world in dust
Lets be the world of love for the ones that follow us

Then love will rule the world and hate would soon be still
Some may say they love but loves a sacrifice
Love is not a state of mind, loves a fact of life

Hate be still
Love get behind me
Peace, what we need

And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light

Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light
Big bank clock chimes
Off go the sleepy front porch lights

As the evening's underway

qui changent notre vie jusqu'aux plus petits détails.

Je n'ai peut-être pas toujours su bien faire
Je n'ai peut être pas toujours été tellement clair
mais je veux que tu saches que j'te garde quand même la meilleure part que j'ai de moi

quand je ne dors pas
j'aimerais dévisser toutes ces planètes
que je ne trouve pas
qui changent notre vie jusqu'aux plus petits détails tout en bas
et qui reviennent danser des heures blanches
pour qu'on ne les oublie pas

t'avais même pas quatre-vingts saisons
derrière tes pas
moi, le vent froid qui fait les vagabonds

quand je ne dors pas
des avions qui s'en vont sur les mers
et ne reviennent pas
y'a une radio qui raconte nulle part et tout bas
des histoires comme on n'en vit plus guère
mais qu'on n'oublie pas

y'a des nuits je voudrais que la terre s'arrête
autour de moi
comme quand je voyais danser toutes les comètes
autour de toi
y'a des nuits je voudrais, je ne sais plus ce que je veux
c'est comme ça
je donnerais tout ce que j'ai pu voir sur terre
pour que tu m'oublies pas

je n'ai peut-être pas toujours su bien faire
je n'ai peut-être pas toujours été tellement clair
mais je veux que tu saches que je te garde quand même

la meilleure part que j'ai de moi
comme on se sort des mauvaises rivières
je me suis sorti du temps où je vivais à l'envers
des heures bizarres où j'étais pas moi-même
aujourd'hui je ne sais plus pourquoi

et pour la peine que j'ai pu te faire
et pour la peur qui te pousse à courir les déserts

William Sheller,"Fallait savoir mettre des gants
Pour être utile à quelque chose
Dans cette famille où tous les gens
Voulaient toujours tout mettre en cause

Un type qui joue pas mal au basketball
Qui joue pas mal de rockn' roll

Mais quand t'étais là je n'savais rien dire
Ils parlaient tous aussi fort
Tu n'voyais mêm' pas c'que ça voulait dire
Quelqu'un qui tient ton regard aussi fort

Fallait savoir passer devant
Ses frères qui jugent et s'interposent
Pour s'approcher un peu des gens
Parce qu'on les aime plus qu'on n'suppose

Qui joue pas mal de rockn' roll

Sur le piano en vieux bois d'rose

J'avance sur la mer calmée
Dites-moi voyez-vous déjà la ligne des dunes
Qui bordent la maison de thé

Fumées en marche tout me pousse
Sur sa table mes lettres doivent s'envoler
Amour en marche tout me pousse
Ses cheveux noirs aux branches doivent s'emmêler

Les bambous seront lourds autour de la maison
Elle portera sans doute un Kimono de coton

Les marins chuchotaient cette nuit sur le pont
Que fait le capitaine a-t-il perdu la raison?  

2. Monsieur un télégramme et j'ai dû prendre la mer
Mais le voyage fut si long
Elle est restée mon rêve et je reviens vers la terre

William Sheller,"J'ai rêvé d'un Iroquois
Qui dansait sans vertige sous la lune
Un épais tapis de brume
S'envolait sous ses pas
Un train venant d'Ottawa
S'illuminait tout en bas
Entre les dunes
De l'édredon demi-plume
Qui me couvre la tête
Alouette
C'est le matin déjà

Laisse moi dormir
Du fond du cœur
Dans la longueur
De ton lit de bois
Encore une heure
Encore une fois
Laisse moi partir
Dans la lueur
Du jour meilleur
De tes volets de bois
Encore une heure
Encore une fois

Une femme en fourreau de soie
Cherchait son anonymat
Dans China Town
Elle marchait comme une espionne
En suivant les caméras
Un tramway passait par là
Roulant sur le pavé plat
D'une rue piétonne
Le contrôleur en personne
Agitait une cloche
Qui sonne
Il est midi déjà

Laisse moi dormir
Du fond du cœur
Dans la longueur
De ton lit de bois
Encore une heure
Encore une fois
Laisse moi partir
Dans la lueur
Du jour meilleur
De tes volets de bois
Encore une heure
Encore une fois


Enfin j'ai rêvé de toi
Donnant une photo de moi
Un peu ancienne
A une cartomancienne
Qui te parlait tout bas
Je me suis réveillé là
Avec le son de ta voix
Un peu lointaine
Tu as ouvert les persiennes
Sur le jardin bohème
Que j'aime
Quand le soleil est là

Laisse moi dormir
Du fond du cœur
Dans la longueur
De ton lit de bois
Encore une heure
Encore une fois
Laisse moi partir
Dans la lueur
Du jour meilleur
De tes volets de bois

We've got to do something
Before all we are is a skeleton crew
There's go to be something, someone can do
But all I can think of is you

Little sailor of the skies
Will you be our eyes
Is there land that lies beyond

Fly far beyond the rain
With a prayer upon thy wing
And in this winter of the storm
Seek a harbinger of spring

Fly far as wings can fly, bring home

Shed no tears for me
There'll be rain enough today
I'm wishing you Godspeed
As I wave you on your way

This won't be the first time I've stayed to face
The bitter consequences of ancient fall from grace
I'm a daughter of the race of Cain
I am not stranger to the rain

And for the boy who's given me the sweetest love I know
I wish for you another love so you won't be alone
Because I am bound to walk among the wounded and the slain
And when the storm comes crashing on the plain
I will dance before the lightning to music sacred and profane

Oh, shed no tears
Light no candle for my sake
This journey I'll making now
Is one we all must take

Shoulder to the wind
I'll turn my face into the spray
And when the heavens open
Let the drops fall where they may

May they finally wash away the stain
Of a daughter of the race of Cain
I am not a stranger to the rain, let it rain

The words that I couldn't keep
But always meant to say
How can we find the time to fill this space?

I'm comin' apart, I'm comin' to you
This game has pushed us so far
Can you pull me through?

Maybe tonight, maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, we'll find our way
Maybe tonight, we'll find a place, between you and me

We're so close, just make it stay
I have lived to feel this way
It's been down but we're not out
This is all I need right now

Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you need
Sometimes you find everything in me

Maybe tonight, maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, we'll find our way
Maybe tonight, we'll find a place, between you and me

William Tell,"Take a breather, let your air out
This can get you somewhere
She's the queen of screaming shit out
If she lets you stand there

You keep ringing in my head
You always do this to me
You keep ringing in my head

Whatever happened to your song?
It's just how the radio sounds
We used to stay out all night long
Living on radio sound

You are thinking you know what's right
Nothing you can't see through
Stand and shiver, turn off your lights
And tell me no one's changed you

You keep ringing in my head
You always do this to me
You keep ringing in my head

Whatever happened to your song?
It's just how the radio sounds
We used to stay out all night long

William Topley,"If a lover wants to stay you know she can't be made to run
You can doctor people's claims with secret ink and carbon guns
There ain't nowhere I can hide where I won't be afraid of you
As unlikely as it sounds you know I'm still in love with you

Well I'm left rubbing twigs in search of a flame for fire
Whilst you like Icarus soar higher

This time I ain't coming back child
You took me once that's enough blackmail now
Sweet love should never turn sour like this
Line me up in your sights and you shoot to kiss

If I could only hear your voice I could put m y jealous heart to rest
But you rule over an isle where the crackling wire don't stretch
With my tail between my legs I bring oddities from far afield
I've sailed the doldrums, suffered lice and sunburn and sargasso weeds

Well I'm left rubbing twigs in search of a flame for fire
Whilst you like Icarus soar higher
The boiling sun will melt the wax that holds your wings
And lover's sheets can't break your fall

It's gonna be alright child

It was a risk, we knew it all along
One mistake you'd play, I'd sing along
It's a mistake, we knew it all along
I can play but you can't sing along

William Topley,"Give me something I can't hold on
And I have never known much love
Give me something I can't hold on much more
And you to me mean oh so much

Said I hope you can cling to the wreckage and stop from drowning
Stop spinning the floor, stop the scenery falling down

Well you can't make love on your own
And you won't get no blood from no stone
And you can't make it right
With two wrongs in one night baby learn my way
And you'd best have a whole lotta soul
If you plan getting by on your own
You can sink like a stone in some hole of your own
And just hide away

Give me something I can't hold on
And I can't place much faith in love
Send me out for something that ain't there no more
Something that once meant so much

Said I hope you can cling to the wreckage and stop from drowning
Get back on your drums and stop letting them break you down

Well you can't make love on your own
And you won't get no blood from no stone
And you can't make it right
With two knives in the night baby learn my way
And you'd best have a whole lotta soul
If you plan getting by on your own
You can sink like a stone in some hole of your own
And just hide away

And now you tell me that you don't know why
Your hands are shaking and your mouth feels dry

Well you can't make love on your own
And you won't get no blood from no stone
And you can't make it right
With two guns in the night baby learn my way
And you'd best have a whole lotta soul

When the guard dogs bray
And your sweetest lover
Can't kill your pain
In the cold of night
By a single flame
Your shining blade
Won't shift the blame 
Oh said I'm sinking so low
Oh I've said I'm sorry so long

Tighten up now mama
C'mon dance now child
You're just a backstreet woman
You got me hypnotized

In the cold of the night
You see the black dog's breath

You can't sneak no rest
You know the brine
Salt taste of death

William Topley,"I guess you don't feel like calling 
Maybe I feel the same
I heard your fog yellow fingers
On the back window pane
Down the Sav La Mar Highway
Hang a left on Love Lane
There's a gingerbread huntress
And desire is still her name

She says such sweet things
Gives me some kind of reason to stay
Wild flowers sweet as kisses
Only drive me further away

If I want to say I love her
If I want to say goodbye
If I want to leave our loving home behind
Sugar that's my right

I know I never call you
I know I am to blame
If you don't ever want to 
Look my way again

Don't play on guilt now
I won't wear that, not today
I'll strip you bare from the bone
Leave you nothing left to play with

I still love you right
Make love all night
Feeling good inside

Too many years have gone by we're still strugglin
We fuss and fight think it's time for new boogining
But everytime I think that I just can't take no more
I pack my bags change my mind and I never go
Should I go, should I stay, should I go
I don't, really know

See ma you runnin me away with ya ways
Got me leavin and not comin home til the next day
And I ain't never comin back to the house til I get some respect
Or I'ma be up in jail for breakin ya neck
I done tried to hard just to make things work
And arguments go too far til ya feelings get hurt
They got me packin my bags but you don't want me to go
Now I'm off to the next braud but I ain't feelin this hoe
I did it fast but now I'm tryin to live life slow
But I'm a man so I reap what I sew
It ain't all about dough 'cause you can't take that witcha
And it seems like you want me to hitcha
So before I do that I'ma leave everything behind
No 30 days when I avict you out my mind, before I do that

Can't incriminate myself, that's why I lie

And it's a destiny thang, so I don't wear a platinum watch and a chain
I'm just tryin to head shot ya brain

A dealer running down the coast
And it's coming on to leaving time
Unload in Alabama and we're sailing on to St. Giles
I'm hitching on a wave on the weather
On a seabird's smile
Bad August on the moon kicking up the wind and rain
The swells hit thirty feet
Steal the balance from my brain
The Captain and his crew
Are cut-throats down in the Port of Spain
White-knuckled at the rains
His timbers wail in shame

See me wistful in some harbor bar
I tend the warm glass and the dwelling scar
I sing my misappropriation song for lovers land-locked
Far too long

Oh angel baby I, lapping on a blue romance for cargo
And by compass with a serpent's tail in chance
Through the forties and the Trades and a cutlass raised in rage
Just for cotton and tobacco
For whiskey and for gage
Take the whip to drive the sugar train
A scent plantation and banana rain
I sing my misappropriation song for lovers land-locked
Far too long
