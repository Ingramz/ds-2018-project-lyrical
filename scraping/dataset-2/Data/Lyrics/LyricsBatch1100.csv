The Bridges,"Fate dropped me front and center, close behind
Was your heart a stolen find?
I'm such a hopeful
I heard the echo let go of your name
Cross her mind, stay within range
When I am listening

[Chorus]
You've got a lot to say
I'm not the one to make you feel this way
But you've got a lot to say
And you've got a lot to prove
I'm not the one to watch you
I'm not the one to watch your heart be moved
You've got a lot to prove

You're keeping things that matter most to me
Love is gone, where is she?
I'm such a hopeful
I heard the echo let go of her name, cross your heart and state it's claim
I've been listening

[Chorus]

Love me in your sleep
(We're fighting through changes)
Dream me so to speak
(We're turning to strangers)
Care enough to wake

Leave secrets out of this
Your love is a hit or miss
You're tuning out my call
Time is the biggest risk of all
Time is the biggest risk of all

I heard the echo let go and I feel alright, at least I think so",Echo,2008
The Bridges,"You've got it bad and I've said it before
I've seen it before you 
And you're so mad 
The way that you love me could only be for me

Tell me all about it oh when I'm down 
Tell me all about it oh when I'm down

You've got a kind of nerve in the sense that I couldn't replace you
A stranger's heart would only reserve you a place to come back to

Tell me all about it oh when I'm down
Tell me all about it oh when I'm down

Take a hit, take a swing, you're the one that I love
Let it all balance out I'm the one you need
Let it go take it slow you're the one I want
Oh oh oh

You've got a way of making me feel 
You're holding my heart still 
And you could say I'm willing to bet 
That I've got my mind set

Tell me all about it oh when I'm down
Tell me all about it oh when I'm down

Take a hit, take a swing, you're the one that I love
Let it all balance out I'm the one you need
Let it go take it slow you're the one I want
Whoa oh oh
Oh oh oh

Forget the close calls 
Don't bring yourself into this
You should know better by now

You oughta know
You oughta know

The way to keep my heart is keeping up

Take a hit take a swing you're the one I love
Let it all balance out I'm the one you need
Let it go take it slow you're the one I want
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh",One I Love,2008
The Bridges,"Slow down, I wouldn't put it past her. 
One lie is not enough to last her. 
I know you're everything you could be. 
It's gone for good.

Her rain will storm out on your thunder.
She'll flood, you'll help him pull you under.
I know you're everything you could be. 
That's why it's gone for good.

One day come over to my place.
I'll make it a fair race.
I'll pave you a one way to my heart.

Speak up, the truth is in the story.
She has the floor and wants the glory.
She'll spill her heart until you notice 
That it's gone for good.

Her storm is stealin' all your thunder.
Her game is leavin' you to wonder.
I know you're everything you should be.
That's why she's gone for good.

One day come over to my place.
I'll make it a fair race.
I'll pave you a one way to my heart.",One Way,2008
The Bridges,"Time isn't telling me a thing its playing with my heart I'm tearing at the seams you on the other hand choosing what to understand is old 


CHORUS:im sure you know how we always find ourselves in the deepest corner of the darkest hour we can't get much louder than this we always lose our hearts in the strangest places picking up the pieces we break I just won't tell you about it I just won't tell you about it ijust won't tell you about it I just won't tell you about 

love isn't costing me a thing you're hearing what you want you want me so it seems time is the risk we take holding on to one mistake let go(let go) CHORUS: I JUST won't TELL YOU ABOUT IT (7 TIMES) 


OH BREAK IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT BOY SAY IT LIKE YOU'VE SAID IT BEFORE YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO MAKE A MISTAKE HAD ALL THE TIME I CAN TAKE

The Bridges,"It was a late dream
The world you made it steam
They put your heart on the stand
And every passerby watched your firefly
With nowhere to land

You rocked your words right
You let them sleep tight
Until love showed it's face
There was a light wind
You left your heart in him
It held your name back from grace

And you rock like you know
That the world needs a show
But you want somebody to love

Runaway, runaway 'cause it fits the fall
And we all know you didn't mean it at all
Runaway, runaway let your words recall
You're not alone, you wouldn't leave us at all

You watched the close calls, foreshadowed broken laws
You put yourself on a stand
You let your guilt ride and found a place to hide
From love's high demand
You found the right pose
The kind a stranger knows
Your heart was up in the air
There was a strong wind, it brought to back to him
But you were too far to care

Now you're out for the sake of a heart you can brake
Because you want somebody to love

Runaway, runaway cause it fits the fall
And we all know you didn't mean it at all
Runaway, runaway let your words recall
You're not alone, you wouldn't leave us at all

When it feels right
You're free to leave
When it feels like
There's room to breathe
And it feels like you're letting go
You're letting go

Runaway, runaway cause it fits the fall
And we all know you didn't mean it at all
Runaway, runaway let your words recall
You're not alone, you wouldn't leave us at all",Runaway,2008

I'm stuck on you, yeah, I know I'm stuck
Don't wanna chit chat on the telephone
I wanna stay after I walk you home

Stuck on you, all right
Stuck on you, all right

You're the glue that I want to huff
A sticky habit I don't want to stop
On you like shampoo
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere

A gummy bear in your underwear
I'm stuck to you, yeah, I'm stuck right there
You're sweet like gum, you're the brand I chew
I'll chew it and stick it right on you

I say nothing ever beats it (nothing ever beats it)

It's everything I needed (everything I needed)

The Briggs,"And I ask myself again
What I got myself into
But its late at night again
And that's not something I should do

But with all the time I spend
I'd still rather lie to you
As an old best friend
Until the very end

Take a chance and speak the truth
They've never lied to you
The floor is my best friend
I've come to visit you again

If you would just let go
Someone else could hold my head
Say a sentence that makes sense
So we can all go home to bed

I will not fall back down",Down,2003
The Briggs,"Idle fame with a plastic smile
Controversial relations keep you on top for a while
At the top of the charts, the bottom of the barrel

Success depends upon the company you keep
Compositions sugar-coated with messages puddle deep
Emotions bought and sold and the going rate is cheap

Gimme gimme gimme a lesson in pop star 101

Pull my strings and give me some cash

Because I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Lead a normal life and work like all the others
Top 40 look out, 'cause I'm gonna be number 1

Business tycoons are writing songs in crayon
Consumer reports show what needs good distribution
Appeal to the masses, the best as you can

Infectious transmission from sea to shining sea
Music without soul, an empty shell

Just think one day, this could be you

Pull my strings and give me some cash

Because I don't wanna, I don't wanna

The Briggs,"It is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out, right you off, there's never enough
Ways to throw you away

[Chorus]
You'd better start runnin'
'Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You shoulda thought twice
'Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
'Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist

You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out, write you off, when I've had enough
Of your verbal debris

[Chorus]

For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man

The Brighouse & Rastrick Band,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",Copacabana,1999
The Brighouse & Rastrick Band,"If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know and I'll be around
If you've got no place to go, when you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Take a chance on me
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You wanted to leave me there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go

You won't be grabbed, if you're feeling horny
Well, you've passes so you got to know this precious property
I don't know the lads, so call me MC K
Nobody sits, understand me clearly
However hard he try, could he never own me

Special K, what he says all said carefully
Me not sit all along and just wait by phone
Not call me 'cause me never, never home ya

The Brighouse & Rastrick Band,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

And see if you remember the struggles of before,
                        F#m            D              E
When you were standing helpless on the outside of the door
        Bm               E            A
And you started building links on the Chain.
Bm                  D                               E                   A 
On the Chain, you started building links on the Chain.


When the police on the horses were waitin' on demand,
ridin' through the strike with the pistols in their hands,
Swingin' at the skulls of many a union man,
As you built one more link on the chain, on the chain,
As you built one more link on the chain.

Then the army of the fascists tried to put you on the run,
but the army of the union, they did what could be done,
Oh, the power of the factory was greater than the gun,
As you built one more link on the chain, on the chain,
As you built one more link on the chain.

And then in 1954, decisions finally made,
The black man was a-risin' fast and racin' from the shade,
And your union took no stand and your union was betrayed,
As you lost yourself a link on the chain, on the chain,
As you lost yourslef a link on the chain.

And then there came the boycotts and then the freedom rides,
And forgetting what you stood for, you tried to block the tide,
Oh, the automation bosses werre laughin' on the side,
As they watched you lose your link on the chain, on the chain,
As they watched you lose your link on the chain.


You know when they block your trucks boys, by layin' on the road,
All that they are doin' is all that you have showed,
That you gotta strike, you gotta fight to get what you are owed,
When you're building all your links on the chain, on the chain,
When you're building all your links on the chain.

Amd the man who tries to tell you that they'll take your job away,
He's the same man who was scabbin' hard just the other day,
And your union's not a union till he's thrown out of the way,
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain, of the chain,
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain.

For now the times are tellin' you the times are rollin' on,
And you're fighting for the same thing, the jobs that will be gone,
Now it's only fair to ask you boys, which side are you on?

Don't you see we must keep in our place?

Have you forgotten how put down we are?

The Broadway Performers,"Deaf Dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.

I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

The Broadway Singers,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

The Broadways,"the sky seemed far away
i tried to make sense of a thoughtless day
no disappointments stale words always know what to say
i took a train to olympia and realized once again how big the world was
i had forgotten how to breathe, we sat on the mountain
it seemed like i could touch the sky, no distractions
and i thought about the word freedom and what it really meant for me
because you see,
sometimes i don't feel so free when i'm stuck here in the city
i fell asleep on the side of the mountain
and i woke up to a peaceful morning
i took a deep breath as i stared across the canyon exhausted
hard concrete screaming my name
another year for me of worthless destiny
i've been waiting for the perfect time to scream
holding on and waiting for a better dream
i let so many slip through my fingers
as i watched the clock fade into the morning
so i smoke another cigarette as the sun rose over the city
but it didn't shine on me,
sleep has never made me happy what's left for me here
another lonely winter night, street lighs and a sleepless dream dismantled
words of indifference fall like rain
immersed into reality we all search for inspiration
sometimes it's really hard to find
but i found it on the mountain, now i'm back and i feel like i never left
sometimes i don't know where to go
a friend once told me to follow my dreams
but lately i've been asking myself
""what does it mean to be free?""
restless, someone tell me what to believe
i waste my days on an old fantasy
it's not the way it used to be

Kill dreams in front of tvs
That is just what they love to hear
Maybe sometime... I will get off this fucking couch
I won't let this world drag me down
Kids like you and me will be FREE
Maybe sometime I won't have to wake up
And see another rainy day
A boring afternoon there's no prize at the end of this rainbow
No one to love
No one to talk to
So I'm gonna grab my umbrella and run outside
No rains gonna drown my ambition
Gonna make it this time

The Brobdingnagian Bards,"Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best...

And...always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the light side of life...

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing.

And...always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the light side of life...

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow.
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.

So always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true.
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you.

And always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the right side of life...
(Come on guys, cheer up!)
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
(Worse things happen at sea, you know.)
Always look on the bright side of life...

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2002
The Brobdingnagian Bards,"Some friends and I in a public house
Were playing a game of chance one night
When into the pub a fireman ran
His face all a chalky white.
What's up"", says Brown, ""Have you seen a ghost, 
Or have you seen your Aunt Mariah?
Me Aunt Mariah be buggered!, says he
The bleedin' pub's on fire!

And there was Brown upside down
Lappin'' up the whiskey on the floor.
Booze, booze!"" The firemen cried
As they came knockin' on the door (clap clap)
Oh don't let 'em in till it's all drunk up
And somebody shouted McIntyre, McIntyre 
And we all got blue-blind paralytic drunk
When the Old Dun Cow caught fire

Oh well, says Brown, what a bit of luck.
Everybody follow me.
And it's down to the cellar
If the fire's not there
Then we'll have a grand old spree
So we went on down after good old Brown
The booze we could not miss
And we hadn't been there ten minutes or so
Till we were quite pissed.

Then, Smith walked over to the port wine tub
And gave it just a few hard knocks (clap clap)
Started takin' off his pantaloons
Likewise his shoes and socks.
Hold on, says Brown, that ain't allowed
Ya cannot do that thing here.
Don't go washin' trousers in the port wine tub
When we got Guinness beer

Then there came from the old back door
The Vicar of the local church.
And when he saw our drunken ways, 
He began to scream and curse.

Ah, you drunken sods! You heathen clods! 
You've taken to a drunken spree! 
You drank up all the Benedictine wine
And you didn't save a drop for me!

And then there came a mighty crash
Half the bloody roof caved in.
We were almost drowned in the fireman's hose
But still we were gonna stay.
So we got some tacks and some old wet sacks
And we nailed ourselves inside
And we sat drinking the finest Rum
Till we were bleary-eyed.

Later that night, when the fire was out
We came up from the cellar below.
Our pub was burned. Our booze was drunk.
Our heads was hanging low.
""Oh look"", says Brown with a look quite queer.
Seems something raised his ire.
Now we gotta get down to Murphy's Pub, 
It closes on the hour

Background: Our friend Snicker first suggested this
Song in 2000 at the Texas Renaissance ""Venice"" Faire
(It rained a lot that year). At long last, we've added
It to our repetoire and what a great addition it is.
It's a great sing-a-long and fun to shout along with, 
And after our first performance of it, I'm happy to say
It's gonna be hit! This version came from a live
Recording we found an MP3 of. Hopefully, we'll have a
Recording some time early next year.",Old Dun Cow,2005

Until you realize, my loss is your surprise
Unless you know otherwise
Then don`t grieve
You see I had to be the first to leave",The First to Leave,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"I don't know what I would do 
If this letter should fall into 
Other hands than it should pass through
For other eyes 

He said,""It was nothing...it's over and done""
But the rotten worm was burrowing still 
It's invades me bleeding me white 
For other replies
I searched his pockets 
I searched his eyes 
I searched his wallet for clues and lies 
And I found a number that I somehow dialed
A woman answered, a woman smiled
Then she hung up on the silence unperplexed
Innocently she spun her Rolodex
I dialed again I could not resist
Revealing just the dentist receptionist 

One day we'll laugh about it or maybe we'll curse
But there is one thing that is making it worse
And it's the lack of forgiveness that I can't disguise
No matter how well he lies 
Now we don't know each other anymore 
And when we touch our lips feel sore
I question the longing left in his sighs 
For other eyes",For Other Eyes,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"I thought I'd write to Juliet's, for she would understand
And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down
Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend
Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,
To welcome death

For I received a letter that is worth reporting
And though it may raise a cynical smile
It leaves a sinking feeling
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant...
""Have you seen my pride and joy?...""
You know the rest...and it's no joke...forgive me please as I quote...
""This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't say where.
So I'm writing to people that I may never meet
And I was thinking if something you said...""

""I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college
I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive
I imagine I may think again...""

""I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack
Your words are a comfort, they're the best thing that I have
Apart from family pictures and, of course, my gas mask
I don't know why I am writing to you""",I Thought I'd Write to Juliet,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"New South Wales
This fifth day of July, in the year of Our Lord nineteen
Hundred and thirty five

Why must I apologize every time that I sit down to write
Through my own fault I may find
You`re no longer living at this address
Please excuse the lack of news
The feeling of strange privilege
For the hour of trial, in these times of distress
Mean more than years imprisoned by etiquette.

I can remember when we were children
Though I could never imagine this day
Your brother told me we`d live forever
""I`ll go one better,"" I heard myself say
And it seems so strange, now that he`s gone to recall all these
Games
While the years have divided us
Friendships have strained and broken

Oh, by the way, how`s that girl that you wed
I hated you then, but I`m over the worst of it
I can`t come home, I might as well say, life is short
I shall not write again",The Letter Home,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"Is anyone there I can talk to?
Give us a sign if you're with me
Can't you see that I'm dying to hear you

Everyone else has lost interest
And I'm all alone in this dream house
Though you're gone
I don't feel like crying
Romeo is calling you

Knock once or twice if you're out there
Send me a message my sweetheart
When I'm out and about I'll be coming to see you

It isn't easy to live with this matronly face
At the window
Try to contact me, if you can see how I'm suffering
Romeo is calling you

Scatter the paper and thimbles
You can take care of the candles
An unplugged radio plays. she is close now
Me and my hand-holding baby walking the floor and the
Ceiling
This is the song she dictated this evening.
Romeo is calling you

The Brodsky Quartet,"You're a swine and I'm saying that's an insult to the pig
In the foul furrow that you dig
Why don't you lay your head down
In that unconsecrated ground
Was she your mother?
Or was she your bride
To defile and to blister
To gnaw at her side
Is this the end of the world?
Now that you've finished your life
This riddle is the work of my little pen-knife",Swine,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"My dear impulsive darling I suspect my letter got to you too late
And it`s really just a silly fragment of paper
But it means so much to those who wait
All the suffering days and nights `til I dare dream again
There you suddenly stand and I`ll be damned if you
Didn't disappear with the dawn

[Chorus:]
Hours pass and darkness comes
Soon I will close my eyes
Will you return if you don`t reply
You`ll be taking my life in your hands
You`ll be taking my life in your hands
Taking my life in your hands

I don`t know why my dearest darling
I can`t tell you how I feel when you are near
When I see you have returned my letters unopened
I will tear them up, your voice ringing in my ears
But you`re kidding yourself if you think this
Correspondence will end
I can always pretend words I don`t have the courage to
Send
Reach you

[Chorus]",Taking My Life In Your Hands,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"Don't send any money!
Fate has no price 
Ignore at your peril this splendid advice
An invaluable link in an infinite chain 
An offer like this will just not come again

You wish you had women to charm and bewitch 
Power of life and death over the rich young girls will be swooning 
Because you're exciting them 
And not only fall at your feet but be biting them 

Guaranteed, guaranteed to capture your breath 
Or just possibly scare you to death 
Sign it and seal it and send it to friends 
But don't mention my name 
Don't make any long term plans 

In thirty-six hours your fortunes will change 
Your best friends won't know you 
And neither will strangers 
Do not keep this letter 
It must leave your hand 
You have been selected from over five thousand 

A twister or dupe will bamboozle or hoodwink you 
I can't say anymore it would only confuse you 
The wine that they offer will go to your head 
And you'll start to see double in fishes and bread

Guaranteed, guaranteed for a lifetime or more
Guaranteed, for this world and the next 
Guaranteed, guaranteed for the world and it's mother
Cherish this life as you don't get another one 

Unless you should take up this fabulous offer 
Don't leave it too late or you'll be bound to suffer
And woebetide anyone so woebegone
You won't know you're born or about to pass on 

You'll never be tired
You'll never be bored 
By the way I just hope you're insured 
And if you're not satisfied 
If you want more 
We can always provide an improved overture
Guaranteed at a price that is almost unbeatable
This offer is unrepeatable

Your troubles will vanish 
Your tears will dry 
Your blessings just multiply
Guaranteed at a price that is almost unbeatable 
This offer is unrepeatable

Guaranteed, guaranteed to bring fortune and fame 
In a riot of colors, a variety of flavors 
Guaranteed at a price that is almost unbeatable

Just sing on the line 
Could you possibly write it in blood?",This Offer is Unrepeatable,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"I write in hopes that by the time you get this letter
We may live to see a change for the better
Or are we so devoted to these wretched selfish motives
When the cold facts and figures all add up
They cannot contradict this sad burlesque

This sad burlesque
With miserable failures making entertainment of our fate
Laughter cannot dignify of elevate
This sad burlesque

Now can they recall being young and idealistic
Before wading knee-deep in hogwash and arithmetic
The pitying smirk
The argument runs like clockwork
Will run down eventually and splutter to a stop

P.S. Well by now you know the worst of it
And we've heard all the alibis that they've rehearsed
The smug predictions
If it`s not a contradiction
Keep faith in human nature
And have mercy on the creatures in this sad burlesque",This Sad Burlesque,1993
The Brodsky Quartet,"The hunted look, the haunted grace
The empty laugh that you cultivate
You fall into that false embrace
And kiss the air about her face
Who do you think you are?

The tres bon mots you almost quote from your
Quiver of literary darts
A thousand or so tuneless violins thrilling your cheap
Little heart
Who do you think you are?

My cigarette burns right down to the ash, my coffee
Cup is unstained
The waiter hovers close at hand
His courtesy strained

Who do you think you are?
I close with my regards
Well I`m the red-face gentleman
Caught in this picture postcard
Who do you think you are?

Trying my best to make the best of your absence
Though the joke gets tired and sordid
Sea-shell hearts get trampled under foot
Punchlines unrewarded

But even at this distance it`s not easy to accept
The vision that I chase returns when I least expect it
I've fallen from your tired embrace
I kiss the air around the place that should be your face.",Who Do You Think You Are?,1993

On the roof of my car 
When St. Lucy's mad torch 
Took away our best bar 

Say we drank 
And we prayed 
Some just sat like a choir 
Came the smoke 
In the night 
Came the heat 
Came the fire 

Ember glow lagered ash 
I was pissed as a fart 
Stricken some dumb plum numb 
We was broken at heart

There's a beautiful view from the top of the mountain
Every morning, I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around
It's become a habit a way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier

It's early mornin' no-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slammin' against those rocks
And when it lands will my eyes be closed or open?

Because of the wine you drank 
Your mind is still a blank 

I wonder how he knows 
I guess I will wonder until 
I pluck up the courage to tell him

And the way you smile the way you laugh
Reminds me of myself
Before I fell apart like a drug infected heart
All along in a city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall around
All alone and suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me
I never wanted your heart to break
But we still knew it would
Impossible to save
But did when I could
I replaced your tears your loneliness with cigarettes and wine
But you needed more and we ran out of time
Now your love is gone
All all alone in the city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall all around
And suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me
And once again I'm torn between saving you or saving me
That's why I begged you not to stay
Any longer than you should
Because I always knew you would
And now it builds more every day
Until you're just an object in my way

So be careful how much you take
They're watching your every move
Waiting on your dance floor
Because you'll never make the right decisions
With busy hands and blurry vision
Mislead you know you won't admit it
You went against your own
She's dead you might have over did it
Now you're on your own
The days are long but the nights are longer
And after midnight the drinks can only get stronger
The end it near so we become smoke and we become mirrors
Come home with me now
I won't have you any other way

Well everybody I know
Has one good chance to die
To be swallowed whole by the big blue empty sky
Feel the heavens stare
With a cold hard look in it's eyes
To hear the sound of something awful on the rise
So pray for safe passage through the night
You'll be humbled by sounds of daylight
And this is an endless search
To find how much is enough
This could be so much worse
But we sold our souls for gold
You know that nobody in this room
Wants to hear you cry
And if nobody goes for help
Baby you're gonna die
It came and went so fast
You'd almost thought you'd missed
A chance to shake your head and say
How did it come to this
Pray for safe passage through the night
You'll be humbled by the sounds of daylight
And this is an endless search
To find how much is enough
This could be so much worse
But we sold our souls for gold
We sold our souls
We sold our souls

If you could just let go
Let's get this right

And we're prepared for the worst
So prepared yourself for the worst

The Bronx,"


Lay her rest with violence and a cold encryption
Empty casket send her to hell with no prescriptions
Glue a mirror to the inside of her empty coffin
So she can stare at her dead face
And follow her new faith home
All the way straight to hell
Dark skies, no flowers, no need for visiting hours
Lowered in trash and let the goddamn earth
Come and search for treasure
Cause who's going to love you now that no one can penetrate you
No one can hear you cum
So follow your new faith home
All the way
All the way back to hell
Because as far as we can tell
There isn't any way
She has to pay
I'm sorry but it's true
You can't save anyone
From her first love to her bastard son
For all of the things that she's done
Dear god I can't wait to finally meet you
You selfish cunt, you've got some explaining to do
Cause we only wish we knew
Anyway
She has to pay
I'm sorry but it's true
Cause you can't save anyone
From her first love to her bastard son
For all of the things that she's done
Dear god I can't wait to finally meet you

",Three Dead Sisters,2006
The Bronx,"


Somewhere along the way I had to break away
Just like a flash of light seen running into the night
I can't quit, I won't stop
I confessed I've always been a mess
And then I woke up in your wedding dress
Baby, you know I gotta swing from gallows
Cause my head already hangs low
Cause these days are so slow
Give me an empty canvas
So I can throw it away
Cause 26 years on the run ain't no fun
I can't quit I won't stop
No matter what you say or who you do
There's no way in hell I'm coming back to you
Baby you know, I gotta swing from gallows
Cause my head already hangs low
Cause these days are so slow
I don't want romance and I don't need a second chance
I just want out of this fucking quicksand
I gotta burn this wasteland down
Because I'm tired of fucking around
Baby you know I gotta swing from gallows
Cause my head already hangs low cause these days are so slow
I don't want romance and I don't need a second chance
I just want out of this fucking quicksand
I gotta burn this wasteland down

And once more before they're gone
And even when you're sleeping baby

From standing on a corner stomping out cigarettes like they were fires

You've got your mothers eyes and whorish skin
You're a train wreck
But that's entertainment

And once more before they're gone
And even when you're sleeping baby you're barely holding on

And wipe the blood running from your nose

And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide
Through I laughed and said my life was fine without You.

And the love You showed on a hill called Calvary
There you died and purchased my redemption
When you broke sin’s power and set my spirit free

I’m amazed that You love me
I’m amazed how You care
Through Your precious blood
I’ve fond pardon
And my sins are washed,
They’re all washed away
All my sins are washed away

It’s true there have been days when I’ve failed You
Lord, You know the many times I’ve gone astray
But I’ve learned that Your love is stronger than my weakness

The Brothers Four,"Once there were green fields, kissed by the sun.
Once there were valleys, where rivers used to run.
Once there were blue skies, with white clouds high above.
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields.

Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun.
Gone from the valleys, where rivers used to run.
Gone with the cold wind, that swept into my heart.
Gone with the lovers, who let their dreams depart.
Where are the green fields, that we used to roam ?

I'll never know what, made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day.
I only know there's, nothing here for me.
Nothing in this wide world, left for me to see.

Still I'll keep on waiting, until you return.
I'll keep on waiting, until the day you learn.
You can't be happy, while your heart's on the roam,
You can't be happy until you bring it home.
Home to the green fields, and me once again.",Green Fields,2006

Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see
West purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

Pretty music, I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flowers echo
From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
""Is it cool?""

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be with my baby

See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'

I have never been so much
In love
Before

What a difference
A true love made in my life
So nice
So right

Loving you gave me something new
That I've never felt
Never dreamed of
Somethings changed
No, it's not the
Feeling I had before

Ooh, it's much much more
Love I never knew that it's touch
Could mean so much

What a difference
And when we walked hand in hand
I feel
So real

Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks say
Don't they know
They're not there
When you love me
Hold me and say you care

And what we have is much more
Than they could see

What we have is much more
Than they could see

What we have is much more
Than they could see

What we have is much more
Than they could see

The Brothers!,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star,2005

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

And then our hear's began to beat as one and then
You slipped away and left me stranded

The Browns,"In my adobe hacienda there's a touch of Mexico
Cactus lovelier than orchids blooming in the patio
Soft desert stars and the strum of guitars make every evening seem so sweet

Evening breezes softly murmur harmony with whippoorwills
When setting sun says the long day is done sweet music starts to fill the air
In my adobe hacienda harmony is everywhere

If I have caused one foot to go astray
If I have walk in my own willful way
Dear Lord, forgive

If I have uttered idle words of flame
If I have turned aside from want or pain
Lest I offend some other through the strain

Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide me love me and my keeper be

Without conversation or a notion

Out of focus

A fabulous creation

Slow and gentle
Sentimental

All styles served here

Fed up with fandango
Dance on moonbeams
Slide on rainbows
In furs or blue jeans

Had your fill of quadrilles
The madison and cheap thrills
Bored with the Beguine
The samba isn't your scene
They're playing our tune
By the pale moon
We're incognito

Down the Lido
And we like the Strand
Arabs at oasis
Eskimos and Chinese
If you feel blue
Look through who's who
See La Goulue
And Nijinsky
Do the Strandsky
Weary of the Waltz
And mashed potato schmaltz

Evergreen

Written By Bryan Ferry & Brian Eno
I thought - you'd be my streetcar named desire 
My way - my taste of wine 
I thought - you'd be that flame within the fire 
One dream that just won't die 
 
All night - looking for new love 
Impossible true love - nothing at all 
Looking for new gods - looking for new blood 
Looking for you 
 
I thought - I'd find you walking in the rain 
Just like a wayward child 
I thought - I'd find you calling out my name 
So foolish is my pride 
 
All night - looking for new love 
Impossible true love - nothing at all 
Looking for new ways - looking for strange blood 
Looking for you 
 
I thought - I'd be your streetcar named desire 
Your man - the one you seek 
I thought - I'd take you deep within myself

Hold on - the flower says reach out 
The thunder says no shout is greater than mine

You're spinning far too far from me
So cruel to be so kind

As I stumble through the dark
Dream lovers dream apart
Starry eyed a vision rushes in
Do I wonder or care
My spirit's bleeding god knows where
A never ending stream

My soul in shadows running blind
And restless as the sea
Via sidewalks through the haze

There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode

And you will be the leader of a big old band

So honey never hang your signal out for me

Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back

That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is a burnin' the rail so woman don't try to follow my trail

This Golden Rocket's gonna blow my blues away
Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your flame

And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song said you're worried now but it won't be long

This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl let's rise and shine good mornin' ya all

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grin
But oh, he starts a-running when the light comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hangin' around

Got lots of mouth when your in a crowd
But when your alone you don't speak loud

Wipe that frown from your face
We'll take everything from this fucking place

Grab, Go, Get - take what you want

The trigger of anger is pulled
Smashing chairs through the window

Grab it out, take it home with me
Excitement riddles my face
When the signal goes up

I need no sweets nor even bread

There came snow and I feared for the garden
So I built a wall and I built another and roofed it over thick and strong
And kept it from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The killing cold could not get in

With other loves that bothers
And a mother saying

Just be quiet and feel it around you

And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made

Beside the legendary fountain

In its clear and jewelled waters

Flow into one another

And two ladies escorting me to the halls

Been on the TV screen

Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be

That I could never ask for what I want
And have it anytime

Knowing this you found the thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that were before
And memories that always seem to tear me from my mind

Between a way to to wear or a thing to loose

Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company

The girls'll tear you apart

An' midnights broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts
Struck shadows in the sound
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' every underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain
In a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist Was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe

I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate, I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway? led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now",My Back Pages [#],1997

On a charcoal bed of dreams you carry on
Though the streets are hot you can still a lot
But you can walk out and forget there isn't time to take a loan

But you're now into something that you were immune to before
And there wasn't a sign you just fell into line at the door
And the question sands in the palms of hands
Of the wretches picking pieces of their minds up off the floor

On the mantel place there is still a trace
Of the plastic face you hung your moments on
And the sudden scare of a landing there on the sea
That you don't care to even see when you're alone

But the day is too short and you can't find support in the sun

About pretty boy Floyd the outlaw, Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon as into town they rode

And along come a deputy sheriff in a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard

And pretty boy Floyd grabbed a long chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down

Then he ran through the trees and bushes and lived a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name

He ran through trees and bushes on the Canadian River shore
And many a starving farmer opened up his door

It was in Oklahoma City, it was on a Christmas Day
A whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say

You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief

Some rob you with a six-gun, some with a fountain pen

Sittin' down by the rhythm review.
Roll over Beethoven rockin' in two by two.

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it.
Roll it over and move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock it, roll it over,
Roll over Beethoven rockin' in two by two.

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
Ain't got nothin' to lose.
Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news.

You know she wiggles like a glow worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top.
She got a crazy partner,
Oughta see 'em reel and rock.
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop.

Roll over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues",Roll over Beethoven [Live],1998

Why can't we go on as three

There's just one answer that comes to be

Tailights flickerin', as he pulled up to a truck stop
The same old crowd was hangin' out again tonight
He said, ""Fill up my tank while I go check my load
It feels like it's shifting all around""

He was the kind of man, do all he could
Above all he had integrity
But he was so young
And on a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl

As he went inside, he was merrily greeted
By the girl with whom he was in love
She held out a glass and said, ""Have another
This is the last time we can meet""

With her hair piled up high and a look in her eye
That would turn any good man's blood to wine

And drove off without tightening down

The Byrds,"Well gather round children, a story I will tell
About pretty boy Floyd the outlaw, Oklahoma knew him well
Was in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon as into town they rode

And along come a deputy sheriff in a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard
And pretty boy Floyd grabbed a long chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down

Then he ran through the trees and bushes and lived a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name
He ran through trees and bushes on the Canadian River shore
And many a starving farmer opened up his door

It was in Oklahoma City, it was on a Christmas day
A whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say
You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief

As through this life you travel, you meet some funny men
Some rob you with a six-gun, and some with a fountain pen
As through this life you ramble, as through this life you roam
You'll never see an outlaw take a family from their home",Pretty Boy Floyd [Live],2006
The Byrds,"The first thing that I heard you say
When you were standing there sad in your way
Was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
'Cause there was nothing there was that you could see
That could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I set you free this time
I have never been so far out in front
That I could never ask for what I want
And have it anytime

Knowing this you found the thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind.
With all the ones that were before
And memories that always seem to tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you see me to be
And I've set you free this time

I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to to wear or a thing to loose
Because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
That was always something you could look at
Lying in your hand

And why it cannot be arranged to have each thing work fine
It isn't how it was set up to be

The Byrds,"Once upon a time there was a garden on a high hill
Green and blossomin' round against the sea
And there the sun came and the rain pourin' down
Garden grew and flourished and splattered bits of color on the ground
And it took shape and symmetry and all of life around
But there came winds driven and howling
There came snow and I feared for the garden
So I built a wall and I built another and roofed it over thick and strong
And kept it from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The killing cold could not get in
But when the sun came and the gentle rain of spring
They could not reach the garden behind those walls
It would have died, safely, securely, died
But as I longed and as I learned I tore the walls all down
The garden still lives",Mind Gardens [Alternate Version] [*][Version],2013

But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal just how badly you feel

And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah

Where our fantasy world can be found

That there is no easy way down

The Byrds,"The water is wide, I cannot cross over,
And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The mountain stands beside the sea.

And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light coming down from the sky

Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark
I hope they get home alright

Had flies in my beard, my toothpaste was smeared
Over my window, they'd written my name
Said, ""So long, we'll see you again""

Was there something I should have said?

Without you, without you

Say anything brilliant
Time out
But keep those cameras rolling
Just in case I
Don't look this good forever

You were someone I shouldn't have met
For your own sake
Let's take my side for once

Word is I got away and now I must be caught

Don't leave, take it from me

I'm going crazy and I've been awake for days
My mirrors are stained with pain and portraits of your face

Don't leave, take it from me,

When you leave me for no reason
I'll give you a reason

I'll put these tips on you

Just to find out that my face had been replaced
Deceived, it was a breeze,
I was tossed to the street

Putting up walls around what was once innocent

The Cab,"And I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't have another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel like I'm Intoxicated

In a room full of frozen faces
In a moment of fractured time
We eclipse in conversation
As the words pass us by

With you we could be the only ones here

'Cause I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't have another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky flying high take me to the moon
Day or night we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

Your eyes like a shot of whiskey
Warms me up like a summer night
Can you tell that I need you with me
Let me drink you down tonight
No I don't just want any pretty face
Wanna wake up next to yours each day

Babe, I want you be my saving grace tonight, tonight

With you we could be the only ones here
'Cause I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't have another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky flying high take me to the moon
Day or night we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

Felt like I black out pass out
Every time that we touch
And if it hurts every moment
Then it must be love
Want your heart, Baby straight no chaser
I wanna feel it in my head when I wake up (when I wake up)

'Cause I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't have another girl
'Cause you, you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky flying high take me to the moon
Day or Night we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

To the sky flying high take me to the moon
Day or night we don't have to say a word
'Cause you make me feel like I'm intoxicated, toxicated

And I think you're from another world
And I, I couldn't have another girl

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh

Come feel my heart
It’s beating like a drum and I confess
When you’re around
It’s like an army’s marching through my chest

And there’s nothing I can do
I just gravitate towards you
You’re pulling on me like the moon
I just wanna get you sideways
I say anything I can to get me more than just a dance
Tell me where to put my hands
You know that you could be my favorite one-night stand

You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

You’re like a song
A beautiful symphony to my eyes
So take me on
I wanna sing along all through the night

I’m not like the other boys
Cause with you I’ve got no choice
You make me wanna lose my voice
I just wanna get you sideways
No, I’m not the type to lie
But I might just start tonight
Let me turn off all these lights
You know that you could be my favorite lullaby

You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do If I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

The Cab,"If today's the day I die
Lay me down under the lights
Let me fall in love
Let me save a life

And let me lose my voice
Singing all my favorite songs
Let me stare up at the stars
'Cause it's where we all belong

My heart like a firework in my chest
My only regret is having regrets
Traveled the world
I loved every step

And all I know is:
No one, no one lives forever
We will be remembered
For what we do right now

And baby I'm living louder
And dreaming longer, tonight
(We're living louder, we're living louder)
And baby I'm fighting harder
And loving stronger tonight
(We're loving stronger, we're loving stronger)

'Cause we're all just kids
Who grew up way too fast
Yeah the good die young
But the great will always last
We're growing older
But we're all soldiers tonight

If today's the day I go
Gonna drink with all my friends
Gonna laugh until we cry
As we talk and reminisce

And let me kiss a stranger
And rob the local bank
Let me become real rich
So I can give it all away

'Cause no one, no one lives forever
But we will be remembered
For what we do right now

And baby I'm living louder
And dreaming longer, tonight
(We're living louder, we're living louder)
And baby I'm fighting harder
And loving stronger tonight
(We're loving stronger, we're loving stronger)

'Cause we're all just kids
Who grew up way too fast
Yeah the good die young
But the great will always last

We're growing older
But we're all soldiers tonight

When you've got your breath inside your head
Every day's a second chance
If I wake up with a beating heart
Will I stand or will I fall?

I'm living louder
Dreaming longer tonight
Baby I'm fighting harder
And loving stronger tonight

And baby I'm living louder
And dreaming longer tonight
(We're living louder, we're living louder)
And baby I'm fighting harder
And loving stronger tonight
(We're loving stronger, we're loving stronger)

'Cause we're all just kids
Who grew up way too fast
Yeah the good die young
But the great will always last
We're growing older
But we're all soldiers tonight",Living Louder,2011
The Cab,"Who are you?
You’re looking like a stranger
You were once my love and my savior
Now I’m left with nothing but your makeup
On my pillow

And I can’t sleep, the pills they never helped
Tried counting sheep, still hurts like hell
I can’t believe this rose has lost its red
And its petals

Who put that rock in your chest, won’t you tell me?
If I said I wished you the best, I was lying

Waking up just brings me down (Down)
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (Nowhere to be found)
And my bed is half empty not half full
I’d rather live with broken bones
Then lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool

Where’d you go?
You said you’ll never leave me
All alone, my heart is barely beating
Like a ghost you haunt me every day that you’re gone

I’m not the same
Now something went missing
There’s a cage, it feels like a prison
Here, I’ll stay until you come back home (Home)

Who put that rock in your chest, won’t you tell me?
If I said I wished you the best, I was lying

Waking up just brings me down (Down)
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (Nowhere to be found)
And my bed is half empty not half full
I’d rather live with broken bones
Then lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Am I a lovesick fool?
Or am I giving up?
Am I a lovesick fool?

Waking up just brings me down (Down)
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (Nowhere to be found)

Waking up just brings me down (Down)
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (Nowhere to be found)
And my bed is half empty not half full
I’d rather live with broken bones
Then lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool",Lovesick Fool,2011
The Cab,"I come over
Quarter past two
Love in my eyes
Blinded by you
Just to get a taste of heaven
I'm on my knees

I can't help it
I'm addicted
But I can't stand the
Pain inflicted
In the morning
You're not holding on to me

Tell me what's the point of doing this every night
What you're giving me
Is nothing but a heart
It's a lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby make up your mind

'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keeping touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

We were on fire
Now we're frozen
There's no desire
Nothing spoken
You're just playing
I keep waiting for your heart
(I keep waiting for you)

I am fiending for the sunshine
To show our love in a good light
Give me reason
I am pleading to the stars (Tell me)

Tell me what's the point of doing this every night
What you're giving me
Is nothing but a heart
It's a lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby make up your mind

'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keeping touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na)

I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Baby why you callin' me?
Not another one night
Try'na be your whole life
I don't wanna fall asleep

I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Baby why you callin' me?
Not another one night
Try'na be your whole life

I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keeping touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss
Temporary bliss

I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
I can't keep feeling love like this
It's not worth temporary bliss",Temporary Bliss,2011
