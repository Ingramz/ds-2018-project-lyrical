Mike Laure,"If you ever go to Trinidad 
They make you feel so very glad 
Calypso sing and make up rhyme
Guarantee you one good real fine time
 
Drinkin' Rum and Coca Cola
Go down ""Point Koo mah nah"" 
Both mother and daughter singin' for the Yankee dollar
 
Any visitor to Trinidad 
Can have good time he never had 
If he come just for rest, okay
Then he lie around in sun all day

Mike Lawler,"Ink and paper, epic offers
Glass moon waltzing on the waters
Horse and carriage
I am courting the marriage
Of dreams in the wings
Of visions unseen

Cross my heart
Only your love will do
Cross my heart over you
Cross my heart
There is room enough for two
Cross my heart over you, over You

Inside, feels like there's a thunder
Spellbound, you've take me under
Gold and diamond
Ever saying that I'm in this forevermore
You can be sure

Mike Lawler,"I'm blazing a trail that leads to vice
So easily enticed
By darker means
When out of the wilderness of choice
I hear that one still voice
Call to me

[Chorus]
Go west young man
Go west young man
When the evil go east
Go west young man
Go west young man
Find a heart that's golden

Why must I wander like a cloud
Following the crowd
Well I don't know
But I'm asking for the will to fight
To wear the crown of life
And you say go

The mind is weak the heart is frail
When it goes beyond the pale
So unwise

Mike Lawler,"(Tell me) How long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power
(Tell me) How long will we bow down to that golden calf

How long will we water down the truth
'Til truth is no more
How long will be too long

[Chorus]
The power of faith and love
Can change the stuff we're made of
But still we wait
(Tell me) How long will be too long

(Tell me) How long will we drink from the chalice of indifference
Neither be hot or be cold
Can a sober soul know
How long will be too long

[Chorus]

Is there not more to us
Than cursed dust to dust
I feel my hope fading
How long will be too long

How long will be too long

(Tell me) How long will we travel from the ways that God intended
Won't it all tumble down if His holy wrath comes
How long will be too long

Mike Lawler,"The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled
A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems
Feels like I'm

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can you still hear me?
Hear me asking
Where do I belong?
Is there a vision
That I can call my own?
Show me I'm

Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find

Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world

Some people quietly reveal
In the manner of the meek
Some people shout the way they feel
To a radical degree
Some people sing it to express
While others hear another call
Some people speak with subtleness
Some don't rely on words at all
But let me tell you 'bout

[Chorus]

One thing I know
Everybody's got a seed to sow
let your heart of hearts
Take you down the road
Everybody's got a seed to sow

We all are pieces of the whole
With different feelings to evoke
Giving distinction to the role
Different players-different strokes
But let me tell you 'bout

[Chorus]

Some people walk
Some people race
Some people vary in their pace
But God can use what you can give
Within the mystery of His ways
Don't underestimate

Mike Leander,"In my time of sorrow,
In my time of feeling bad
Oh what I'd give
Just to relive
All of the good times that I've had.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of feeling alone
There was a time
I could ease my mind
With thoughts of just being on my own.

Changes of life
I'm going through
Keep me from doing
What I know I should do.

In my time of sorrow
In my time where teardrops fall
I can't tell you why
I don't want to try,
But the time has come
For me to say fare well.

Mike Leander,"Past the cafe shutters down,
No one stirs in the town.

The morning after the rain
The barges move on the Seine.

Down the avenue lined with trees
Paris bells ring on the breeze
Paris bells ring on the breeze.

Dawn is breaking, birds start to sing,
Sun is rising, warms everything.

The echo of footsteps on a cobbled street,
Dim alleyways where the shadows meet.

Down the avenue lined with trees
Paris bells ring on the breeze
Paris bells ring on the breeze.

The places where we used to visit,
The chapel where we went to wed.

Paris bells on the breeze
Often stir memories.

We both knew the morning rain
We both wandered down the Seine.

Now you're gone away from me
You're just a memory
Like the bells ring on the breeze,
Paris bells ring on the breeze.",Paris Bells [Live][Version],2008
Mike LeDonne,"For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, after the love has gone

Mike LeDonne,"Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Mike LeDonne Quintet,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry

Mike LeDonne Quintet,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Mike Lee,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Mike Leech,"I will pledge my heart
To the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'll forsake my rest
For your happiness
'Til my death I will stand by you

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you
No other to take
For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue
'Til my death I will stand by you

There are wars and there are rumors
Of wars yet to come
Temptations we'll have to walk through
Though others may tremble
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
'Til the battle is won, I will not rest
'Til my death I will stand by you

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you

And Charlie's got a good wife

That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do 
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past 
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time 
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said 
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

Buried in your silent treatment
How many walls did I face
You're allergic to change
And I wanna say something
Then I'll leave you
To take your way
Of loving to the grave

Sometimes, when you're hurting
The hurt is blinding
Who decides when something's
Not worth saving

We've always had a place to hide
So being here, just you and I
Feels like a confessional
I'm bound to say
How I feel and I can't lie
Cause it was so beautiful
It used to feel so natural
If I'm telling the truth tonight
I'm looking for a way of saying goodbye

Took a wrong turning somewhere
Burned the bridges
That would take us back there

Pretending to be something
That we're not
Could never put my finger on it
But maybe if we're being honest
I want what we had
Not what we've got

How're you gonna find it again?

'Cause I'm all messed up inside
Nothing seems to kill this love
No matter how hard I try

I tried to forget you
God knows I've tried my best
I wish I could shoot this love
But I'm powerless

I look at the mirror deep inside of me
But the memories
All flow like an endless sea
So here I'm standin'
And after all you put me through
I don't know how not to love you

There is a feeling
That's screamin' for more

Mike Leon Grosch,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head

I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up

Packed up in tanks under the trunk, 59 to 77 
Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind,2004

Now I see what you want me to be 

Are our wires just crossed 
Or am I really lost

Looks like rain's on the way 
Looks like whatever you say 
Yes I'm afraid to ask 

What's right for you is not right for me 
Now I see what you want me to be 
Sunrise in the wrong constellation 
Star sign pointing to my destination 
Take my place in a long line of confusion 
Just a taste of my own brand of illusion

And the silence cries out to us 
Should we leave well enough alone

You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy

And you hide from my eyes

You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water

You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned

Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed

Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?
Someone like you and made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then.
But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
I was lonely and unhappy, 
And my lips were cold as ice.
But you kissed me, and good heavens, 
Now I'm here in paradise, 
So if ever I'm not kissing you or looking in your eyes.
I won't be blind, and I won't cry.
I'll look up high and gladly sigh, 
And thank the guy,

Maybe there they’ll be

Raise their hands to hail another king

Mike McGrath,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

I want to come home to you

Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

Mike Mullins,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2001
Mike Murley,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2001

Lars: Hey yo Ill Bill – will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

I saw precious things come into view
And I pored through the files taken off my mental shelf
And dusted off some memories of you
Then I thought about the time when our affair was green
How the phoenix of our love first flapped its silken wings
All the urgency and passion
Of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remembered the times when our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
And the hours of silence while a perfumed candle glowed
And both our thoughts meandered on for miles
I remembered the times I said I really had to go
And I remembered the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you
That it really was a lie
And though you never knew it dear 
I cried

Well it's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
And how the years that roll by can start you listening 
Not just to what they say
But what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
And if the razor edge of youth-filled love is gone
But we're both a little older
Our relationship has grown
Not just in how it's shaped
But how its shown

Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon
With the unexpected destination of my home


Half the thoughts I'm thinking speak in sighs
As that same old wave of lonliness returns
And I can see you when I close my eyes
Speaking very softly as you turned

Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon
Looking over maps of memories for the road
Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon
With the unexpected destination of my home

Go and let go

Standing in the lonely light of the silver moon

Mike Nesmith & The First National Band,"Her name was Joanne, and she lived in a meadow by a pond.
And she touch'd me for a moment,
with a look that spoke to me of her sweet love.
Then the woman that she was drove her on with desperation,
and I saw as she went a most hopeless situation.
For Joanne, and the man, and the time that made them both wrong.
 
She was only a girl, I know that will, and still I could not see;
That the hold she had was much stronger than the love she had for me.
But staying with her, and my little bit of wisdom,
broke down her desires like a light thru a prism;
into yellows and blues and a tune that I could not have sung.
 
Tho' the essence is gone,
I have no tear to cry for her 
and my only tho't of her is kind.

I seem to have led a charmed life.""

For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"", came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip""
In the town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
one and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came there to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
after Texas Red
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
The morning past so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out on the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
every body held their breath,
For they knew that handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
about to meet his death
There was forty feet between them
when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have gone on livin' but he made one final slip

The Milky Way's a fine sight to see.
All around our universe, we try so hard to view

And take a spin by some nebula.
I hope the sky stays clear for us, the night goes on so far
In stars.

Saved by a bell,

Jupiter and Saturn spin by.
Passing by companions, they all go drifting by.
They fly!

Carry me down to see Aquarius.
We're hoping to meet a shooting star.
I can see there's going to be a message from afar.
How close we are.

Her heart bleeds; it's a true love story

Misty shape in the window by her bed
Dreaming on what she's read
Hero takes her hand and leads her through
Who knows what this night will do?

[Chorus] 
Only in the blue night, he comes to her
Only in the blue night
That's when the whole night belongs to her
Only in the blue night

I see a dark face by the moon's glow
As she reads from a true love story
Beckoning hand scratching at the window
Her heart bleeds; it's a true love story

Misty path and the night is endless.
She could be a queen or a desert princess.
Hero takes her hand and leads her through.
Who knows what this night will do?

[Chorus]

Only in the blue night
Only in the blue night
That's when the whole night belongs to her
Only in the blue night

She wants to break free
From the cold light of reality
And as she drifts away
I hear her voice say, ""come away.""

Dark skin glistening by the silver light
This is the hero come tonight
And taking her hand, he leads her through
Who knows what this night will do?

Only in the blue night

Mike Oldfield,"I hear a voice from paradise,
Looks like a new day dawning.
So clear, I just open my eyes.
Can't you hear the voice calling?
I feel a rush in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth moving.

Reaching out for you.
There's something magic in the air tonight,
I can feel the Earth move.
And it moves me.

Reach out - it's a leap in the dark,
But there's no danger of falling.
Give out, give it straight from the heart.

I suppose you think that nothing much is happening at the moment
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Well, that's what I want to talk to you all about; endings
Now, endings normally happen at the end
But as we all know, endings are just beginnings
You know, once these things really get started, it's jolly hard to stop them again
However, as we have all come this far, I think, under the circumstances 
The best solution is that we all just keep going
Let's keep this going in sight, never an ending
Let's remember that this world wants fresh beginnings
I feel here, in this country, and throughout the world, 
we are crying out for beginnings, beginnings
We never want to hear this word ""endings""
I know we all want to sit down
I know you want to take it easy 
Of course we're looking for the good
Of course we're looking for the fresh start
Isn't that charming? Do you know, I really feel I could dance

There's a jewel in your heart
And a star that shines for you
Watching everything you do
Don't you cry though it may seem
You were born into a dream
There's another race to run
You were not the only one
Standing in the morning sun
Waiting though it had begun
May you never run aground
Or call into the deep deep sound
Stormy weather turns to blue
Here's a song to take with you",Taurus II,1994

Mike Oldfield,"The first time ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day

Four a.m. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to terms with me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day

Far away on the other side
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five

Mike Oldfield,"Away to the westward
I'm longing to be
Where the beauties of heaven
Unfold by the sea
Where the sweet purple heather blooms
Fragrant and free
On a hilltop high above
The Dark Island

So gentle the sea breeze
That ripples the bay
Where the stream joins the ocean
And young children play
On the strand of pure silver
I'll welcome each day
And I'll roam for ever more
The Dark Island

True gem of the Herbrides
Bathed in the light
Of the midsummer dawning
That follows the night
How I yearn for the cries
Of the seagulls in flight
As they circle above

His kiss is the touch of the sun before the earth's new dawn.

Tonight the moon is dripping on the coloured river we knew
O take me where he lies cryin' in the mornin' dew

Lost in a river last saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay
I pray
I see you in heaven far away

I stay
I pray
I see you in heaven far away

Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was light in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

I stay
I pray
I see you in heaven far away

I stay
I pray
I see you in heaven far away

Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy but the air was alive
She couldn't find how to push through

Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side.",Moonlight Shadow [Big UK and European Hit],2016
Mike Oreilly,"What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill
Come through, blow something, smoke something
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side
Letting y'all broads know, we too real

What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like
You don't know me
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a
Little bit lonely
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of
Your butt
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up
All your time
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on
You
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke
Marijuana
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers
Through your hair
Go to the Residence Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of
Underwear 
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so
Don't leave no scars
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have
Do a little wine and take a little bath
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you
Down
All you got to do is put me in the penn
Got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something 
Keep it on the low and we could do this today

[Chorus]
Let's chill, so I could knock you down
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do

OK, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump
In my ride
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside
With our minds, you got something that I cut for
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust
You
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls

Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the
Curb
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could
Receive
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight
Up and real
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife 
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on
Your mind
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to
Chill baby

[Chorus]

I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been
Captured 
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away
Together
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on
The lever
Get aqua tinted with each other as we feel the Mo City
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never
Show pity
But if you scared, I mean you not alone
It might be the ghetto but I call it home
90 percent of the killers are cool with me
So it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I
Was lying
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in
Between the thighs
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and
Then slow dance
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon
The stereo bumping our slow jam song
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it
On
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in
Your life
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your
Life

Three liter big red, got diluted nines fed
Able to make a bitch, want to suck my naked head
I get fly when I want to, graduated from corners
I know it tingle, cause your pussy marinated my sauna
If you capping I ain't tripping, cause I really don't need you
Probably say your pussy gon' be beat up, and having a seizure

And radio stations, got us in regular rotation
'Cause the guns unloaded, lot of heads got exploded
Destined to be the throw deaf, if I'm properly promoted
Sewed it up like a sweater, financial back or go-getter
Then through your vest chest, with the talons in my Beretta
Stay one step ahead of, my competition they better
Fly down from overseas sign down, and get to chumping for cheddar
Twenty-six letters than Ro, if you ain't know now you know
From Ridgemont Four to Akapoko, I'm gripping grain in my flame

Sunday morning pulling out my bitch, I'm looking good
Nothing but diamonds around neck and around my wrist, I'm looking good
Doubles breasted tailor made, I'm Sacci'd down to the flow
And it don't matter, if you step on my wing tipped shoe
'Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

Rolly on me wrist, Sansun me wrist band
Twenty inch rims, on me suspension
Foreign replay, and not forge my stunna
Dressed everyday, in the latest fashion look
Boys the enemy, best respect the man
Listen to me, know it's rule number one
No buster ain't right, we told the game plan
You do, you better and change the wrist band
The way me flow, my retaliation
So listen to me boy understand, understand
It's a bezeled out wrist, and that I wear everyday
On the right hand-a, the Presidential Rolly
And it's crossed off, like a ton of ice on the tray
And the price start-a, my choice to lose security
If you don't believe me, ask your old lady
I know she saw it, from 'Poko miles away

And it don't matter, if you step on my wing tipped shoe
'Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

Pull up to my bump, as I let it recline
Thirteen's easy five screens, it ain't no fucking with mine
They think I'm fucking with nine, but I multiplied it by fo'
It took some time, but I decided to throw my bitch on the 4's
The bubble-eyed Mazaratti, on a mission to meet Scotty
With bullets for your body, 'cause I'm living like Gotti
Pistol grip and a beam, plus a murdering team
Cash rule everything me, that there ain't nothing but green
Jumping in and out of line, moving slow as I want to
Smoking reefer bending corners, on twenty inch Yokohama
'Cause these niggas be hating me, when I be crawling down
So I'm like Paul Bugsy with a infrared, cause these niggas be falling down
Steady yelling out timber, from the first dance January down to the last dance
December better remember, put a big shell casing up in you
Make you weak like S-W-V, when I shine and grind like E-S-G
But I gotta get love like the Big Steve, throwed in the game like that P-A-T

Soar like an eagle, from the porch smoke in my nose
And I bust it down upon the center, and feel it up with cess
And start fill licking roll up ganja, now smokers got test
Gangsta smoker, times is not joker
Ignite the kill, I wanted to puff and they taught me
One to one original feeling, watch me take the fondour
I'mma walk up to the sweet house, and start to rap on the door

I'mma get a box of phillys from out the sto', and come right back
Then I'mma roll a philly, fat as a finger and light that
Lemon lime hydro and regular pine, you know I like that
Under of the influence of sticky, there's no need to fight back
Cause I love it when I be lifted, all of my gears be done shifted
One deep in the rental car going off, because I'm talented and gifted
Scooping up nothing but playas, and we're thinking the same
Nothing but flipping and sipping, and running a train on Mary Jane
Love it mayn, rolling em and blowing em all day
Posted up at the Red Booth Inn, smelling good in the hallway
With a wet towel up under the do', but that ain't enough to stop the do-do
But like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

Nothing but, swisher smoking tonight
Anything that you want from me, gotta wait till I get high
I'm not capping but, only sticky green is on my mind
But if you wanna match your sweet, well I think we can compromise

I'mma huff and I'm gon puff, cause I done made it a habit
From point A to point B and even to point C, I'm searching for some cabbage
Hold up look up in the sky, is it a bird is it a plane
Naw it's slim and brown, and smelling so lovely it's Mary Jane
I'll admit it I'mma fiend, for nothing but coedine and killer green
With a 24 hour lean, I'm always smoking on the scene
Everybody wanna put me to the test, I'm just trying to ease the tension and stress
Inhale but I gotta let it go, congested in my chest
In an attempt to bust a lung, hydro ponics got me sprung
Going broke behind this woman, and willing to spend all my funds
I gotta get a fat sack for one double O, but lifted that's fa sho though
And like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

Nothing but, swisher smoking tonight
Anything that you want from me, gotta wait till I get high
I'm not capping but, only sticky green is on my mind
But if you wanna match your sweet, well I think we can compromise

I'm lighter than Al, trying to smoke myself into another dimension
Please light up that there, cause I really need to calm my nerves I be tripping
That's why I gotta stay smoking, but to keeping my balance is really a challenge
And I'm violently choking, hit the coat drop 85 mo' when I say fatter than a fat pack
Maybe that would be R-A to the N-K, everyday all day
Stimulating my mind, Guerilla Maab one deep and I'm one of a kind
You better not try to crush that love, better pass if you wanna live puff-puff give
On the cool I'm stuck in my buzz, I could poke on golds with red hair punk cause 
I'm blowing kill
Even if I'm on paper for pulling a caper, I gotta be blowing still
And you know it's real, burning kill
With a wet towel up under the do', but that there ain't enough to stop the do-do
And like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

Why, do we live this way
So many murders, where the children play
And it's about, to make me lose my mind
We're running out of time, too many of my people dying

[Z-Ro]
Day by day it's more impossible, to hold on
I'm going head up with the shadow of death, and getting stole on
Will I survive, is God gonna come and save me
I started out as a Christian, now look at how this world made me
I'm crazy, and I can't make it no better
Cause I can't stand none of my friends, my only love is for the cheddar
I remember, sipping on Tangaray and getting high
Down with eachother, long as we was barely getting by
We grown men, and all living in sin
Shooting a kite to my people, cause he in prison again
Letting him know that the streets ain't changed, still wicked
Plus I been burying so many motherfuckers, we bound to kick it
Up close and personal, cause niggaz be pushing my button
I handle my bidness, and exit they homes gangsta strutting
One deep, nobody's got my back
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
Trying to stab me in my back, and if they could they would
That's why I pack my twin bitches, cause I don't even feel safe in the hood
At least on lock, you know what the danger is and what's not
Free world you'll be evicted, when a coward bust shots
That's the life cycle, kick it with real niggaz
And never let the shife by you, because the devil is they idol
Man they tied up my nigga, and sawed off his head
The cold part about it, they ain't even take no bread

[Hook]
[Z-Ro]
My nigga Grady took seven shots, and one bullet hit him twice
Although he's blessed, my nigga just can't leave the thug life
You know it's fucked up, both of us was in class with honors
But soon would drop out, addicted to cash and marijuana
And the fast life, we bled the whole hood last night
Hard headed dumb niggaz, just trying to get they cash right
Hustling, hoping we can get a million
But like a chameleon, nigga the game done changed
Wish it would rain sometime, to help a nigga wash away the pain sometime
I shed ghetto tears daily baby, I can't hide the fact
Feeling like everybody's out to get me, so I don't hide my strap
I ride like that, with one up in the chamber
On my block if you ain't got a glock, you's in danger
Continuously head busting for nothing, my friends and my enemies
Nothing but recollection, as I remember the memories
If I could be like Jesus, I'd spread the love
But I can recognize the demons, so I spread the slugs
These motherfuckers say they love me, but I'm peeping they lies
Feel like jealousy and envy, when I look deep in they eyes
That's a friend for you, laced up with your girl and then try to
Spend your ends for you, and when it's drama they won't send for you
That's the reason Joseph, is one deep until he die
I ain't gotta wonder why, my people want to see me fly, fuck em

A skinny redneck with one of his kinfolk
I pull up along side and blast the passenger
Blood, feathers and bone, a massacre
I kept shootin', hit the driver
He fell on the horn stuck
Threw a molotov cocktail and blew up the truck

Out here pretending like you ain't offendin'
I say fuck your rebel flag

The headless horseman fell dead in the woods
The rest of the clans man ran cause' they were scarey
It was tim the baker and [?]
They all pussies, threw off there hoods and cried please
But they were devils, so I capped there knees

Pride for what?
White pride for slavery it sickens my gut
I see that flag as a challenge that you want to fight
You don't care who it offends
You say it's your right
Well it's my right to sock you dead in your lip
Put a foot on your neck, until you eat up a dick (bitch)
No matter where you live, you should hate that flag
'Cause it represents evil bigots, tell em' shaggs

One, two, three rednecks on a ladder

It don't matter how many of ya
Because we don't love ya
Stick you in the dirt, tombstone above ya

How do I honour, my dead beat father, who walked out on two kids, like why bother,
And left my mother with poverty, fuck my dad, I wanna slaughter thee?
Look at this world and all the Gods, how can I not look at all the odds.
Ya got Allah, Buddha, Jehovah, Jah, Give Praise, however you was raised.
How do I not wonder who's right or wrong, how do I keep my believin' strong?
How do I make it to Shangri-La, when the worlds so fucked up, damn its hard?

How do I live a beautiful life, when all of this darkness, has covered my life,
How could this be, you said was a lie, how will I know if I done good in your eyes?

I'm asking how, how can I ignore the hotties, how do I not check their slammin' bodies?
How do I stay Faithful and quit the game when I doubt my wife is doin' the same?
How in the fuck can I not have any, drive a bucket and I want a Bentley?
Live in a trailer and not envy a man who's got a mansion sittin' on land. 
Is this a joke, how can anybody, with nothin' see the rich and not be salty,
And what if some psychopath had my son, how can I not just grab my gun.
How can I not have adrenaline buzz, aim and blow a hole where his eyeball was?
I saved my son he's alive and well, but I killed a man am I goin' to hell?

How do I live a beautiful life, when all of this darkness, has covered my life,
How could this be, you said was a lie, how will I know if I done good in your eyes?

How can I actually be a saint, how can I live and be somethin' I ain't?
How do I not steal, when I'm dyin' of hunger, and I end up under?
How do I just turn the other cheek, when I'm disrespected, slapped and beat?
What's wrong with fightin' back and winnin' how come if I'm not a punk I'm sinnin'
How can I pray true and true, when most of what I pray for don't come through,
And what about science and all the facts. How do I keep my faith in tact?
How do I not lie when the truth is painful, embarrassing, harmfull or shameful?
How do I not live afraid of hell and be happily content my soul is well?

How do I live a beautiful life, with all of this darkness, is covered my life,
How could this be, you said was a lie, how will I know if I done good in your eyes,

She was self vindictive and wicked into shame

As the years went by she continued using suckers
Hard working individuals who gave all just to fuck her
As Erica grew older her look's begin to fade
She's spent every dime they had to be surgicaly upgrade
But that would only last so long as time continue ticking
The evil lure the Erica crew as now she's old and bitching

Taught only in the finest schools he shut up like a comic

Never thinking of the greedy or tryin' to understand
He landed at high paying job, his wealth accumulated
Charities that's often but only left degrading
He married and had children but money's what he love
He never had time for his kids in oddest ways he shoved 'em
He grew older in his fashion and never was he proud
Of anything that they've accomplished and he screamed loud
Finally one of his sons who've felt rejected and neglected
Commited suicide and John still didn't correct it
John grew older rich and greedy and he's died this way

Where I plan to play games with others
Whose names I can't follow,
But faces stick to me
Stronger then rice does that mom made when I was in school.

Back to the church that is sitting on Race St.
I wait to play games with 9 others 
A game that we learned as young children
But products have taught us that winning is better then fun as young children 
And scuffling wins in the end

Play nice
The teacher in school gave us instructions 
But children in school grow up to be cowboys 
Who like to watch cattle be tortured for fun entertainment 
On this day a game turns to fighting a black man 
Landing on my upper lip formed from some tissue 
I still feel a lump from where fist turns to a weapon 
On this day I wonder how fighting wins over a peace train 
A song with a vision much stronger than my will could ask for 
Lying here useless on this day where skies are much bluer than oceans 
And mountains are closer than most things

With too many, responsibilities, yeah

Look, love don't love nobody 
Drugs don't love nobody, so why you put that shit in your body? 
Now we can't have a decent conversation 
Cause she always shakin' 
I tried to deny it at first, it bothers me now 
Don't ask for money, you done ten dollar'd me out 
I even took yo' kids when they put you out the last house 
But I will not babysit while you in a crack house! 
And I would hate, to turn 'em over to the state 
Look what I did, I let they bad-ass stay and just tear up my crib 
While you hurt me child, horribly 
He asked me why my momma love drugs more than me 
I couldn't answer, I sat back and peered in the sky 
I thought it was rainin, but damn, there was tears in my eyes 
He was like you gon' be alright Uncle Che? 
I'm like man, look

Yeah, sister, don't you know 
You're worth, more than gold (way more than gold) yeah

I sew what's in your, soul, yes I do yes I do

Where my mind goes when I’m without you

When your hands are held up high
And you open up your heart and soul
But that's not enough for most.

I remember this much
There is nothing
You shouldn't speak of
If you got something to say
And there is no one
To be scared of
Just get them out of the way

Going out in a blaze of glory

You can take anything that you want from me
There is nothing left to hide

Going out in a blaze of glory
My hands are held up high
I'm learning how to hit back
I'm learning how to fight

The law of the jungle says
You look after yourself
But I remember this much
I love as I've been loved myself.

Don't forget what I told you now
When the question keeps on coming
And it's ""how much more can you take""
When they've ripped your clothes to pieces
""shouldn't you be gone by now""

But you keep on
Going out in a blaze of glory
Setting your sights for the sky.
They can offer you anything at all
But your dreams must not be sold.
Going out in a blaze of glory
No price is high enough
I'm fighting back with feeling
I'm fighting back with love

When the nails are biting into your hands
And the cross is heavy on your heart
Now is the time to really make a stand
My hands are held up high.

Mike Peters,"Well, back in '75
When the kid was on the line
And he felt no pain
'Cause there was none
He would bend in the wind
Take in anything
Like sniffin' roses
And it was alright
Until he fell
And cut his hand
He just could not understand
He'd run away
Blame pretense
For defence
Or plain innocence

Say that's alright
The harder it fights
I'm one step closer to home
The deeper it bites
I'm one step closer to home
And you can tie my hands
Or whip my back
I can't give in
'Til the sky turns black
I may get lost

I'm ONE STEP CLOSER TO HOME

Oh yeah he ran
Hitched, rides
Travelled light
Left his bags behind
Said he'd lost them
He said that's O.K.
I get money and a smile
From place to place
And they don't mind
I've had the heads of business men and I just gave them
Right back again
I've got no need
For device, disguise
Or for their compromise

Said that's airight

The tougher it gets
I'm one step closer to home
The more that I sweat
I'm one step closer to home
And you can tie my hands
Or whip my back
I can't give in
'Til the sky turns black
I may get lost
I'm ONE STEP CLOSER TO HOME

There ain't no need for this at all, at all
Surely you can help me out
Say, I know a lot of people just like you
Plently to live for and nothing to lose
So tear it all down
Smash it all up
Break it all down and then just

Build it up

Build it up
Ah now build it up
Oh you build it up (Build it up)
Ah now build it up (Build it up)
Ah build it up
Build it up, Build it up, Build it up, up, up, up

And the tougher it gets
And the more that I sweat
And the harder it fights
And the deeper it bites
I'm one step closer to home
And the harder it fights
I'm one step closer to home
And you can tie my hands
Or whip my back
I can't give in
'Til the sky turns black
I may get lost

Taking me higher

Is pure ascension fire

Mike Peters,"Well I find myself in reverie
'Bout what we might have had
And what might have been
We had something going once

That was such a long, long time ago
It was way back in '76
Our friendship formed of pure innocence
We first met in Mathew Street

Where we heard something that would set us free
A sign stands over a door, it says
""Four lads who shook the world""
In the depths of those heady nights

We would dream of those bright lights
Oh my friend, Oh my friend, Oh my friend

And my friend John, he went away
He made some mistakes
Spent time in Walton jail
And now when I see him we still talk

But there's no light shining in his eyes
And Susie, she was seventeen
And more beauty in this world
I swear you'll never see

I was gonna be king
And she was gonna be queen
But now all she does is hide behind the tears
If there was more sense in this world

And work wasn't so hard to find
You would not be going your way
I would not be going mine
Oh my friend, Oh my friend, Oh my friend

Somewhere tonight out on the street
Somewhere beneath this city's heat
In the eyes of strangers who pass me by
Life is cruel and so unkind
Oh, Oh the SPIRIT OF '76

And Pete has seen his dreams come true
But that don't make him no hero
He's just one of the lucky few
If a man can't change the world these days

I still believe a man can change his own destiny
But the price is high that has got to be paid
For everyone who survives there are many who fail
I've seen my friends caught out in that crossfire

All their dreams and hopes smashed on the funeral pyre
I will never give in until the day I die
Get myself some independence
Carve out a future with my two bare hands
Oh my friend, Oh my friend, Oh my friend

Somewhere tonight out on the street
Somewhere beneath this city's heat
In the eyes of strangers who pass me by
Life is cruel and so unkind
Oh, Oh the SPIRIT OF '76

Mersey lights shine in the distance
Same as they did for us then
Mersey lights shine bright in the distance
Where are you now my friend?

You see some nights when I can't sleep
I still think of you

And all the promises,all our dreams we shared
I know those lights still call to you
I can hear them now
I can hear them now

Love can make it move
Love can shine her burning torchlight
In the bed of fools
Love can be your witness
She is judge as she condemns

Seem rich although your poor
Love can be your honesty
When your conscience comes to call
Love can count you out in ten
When she's got you down on the floor

And that's why love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
Love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
It ain't over 'til it's over

Or torture time so slow
Love can heal a gaping wound
Or make the pain explode
Love can be the difference
Between life and the hangmans rope

When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life

With coke she’ll smoke your grass toss your ass like a javelin

You better take out a mother-fucking loan

Tricky Nicky’s gonna spread her disease
Don’t bother to play the father she can’t have no babies

The coke she’d steal would make her feel good for an hour or two
‘Til she woke up with her throat cut in a hospital room

And operate machinery

Do I gotta do? to get past the shit that I'm goin through
I guess I'll write these words, and hope this alcohol controls my nerves

I'm living among fools, I say I'll learn from their mistakes
I know that it's untrue, I'll only learn from notes I take
Now how can I show you my real concept for what's at stake
The worst decision is the one you're too scared to make
People let me shed a little light on this subject
Spread the word to the general public
About the clouds that follow me around my head
Enough to make me dread
Even the comfort of my bed
I try to relax and just kick it
But parking tickets
Make me wanna tell the cops to stick it

Some stupid motherfucker stole my cds and my tape deck
Out with my ride
And now I'm screamin why why why's
Every night and day filled with fuckin misery
It's a mystery
That's killin me
If only I had the ability
To learn just a little bit of self control
Maybe I could find a way to save my soul
And hide from every cop that ever came my way

go ahead, just leave me
I'll be on the floor if you need me
Man, it's been a long day

Tellin them what I really think about them

Mike Portnoy,"I know it's getting late
But I feel I need, I need to explain
All the laughter and the lies
Can't stay the fear or hide the pain

Somewhere along the way
We exchanged our dreams for selfish pride
There was a common goal
But somehow that vision has died

Is it so hard to understand
The facts that you ignore?
We've grown so tired of trying
Wasting our time criticizing

Oh, and nothing's easy anymore
Nothing's easy anymore

Is it too late to understand
The writing that's on the walls?
While we watch time slip through our hands
We're deaf to our own demands

I got this feeling this feeling I know it
That I'm about to make some millions,some millions then blow it
My my my my noobie's Brazilian, she gorgeous
This new life that I'm living it's hard to absorb it
Ever had that feeling when you pull out they say who that
New school, blue black, drop top, push back
It's Ali I knew that, threw the whole bar two stacks
When I'm in the building and the hoes run a full flack

It's the feeling of a boat
I got trials on my line, got a million dollars house
We used to rot in coogie sweaters
Now it's Gucci all the time
Freshen hair, leather season
Wanna toll the summer time
Used to have a little bank roll
Now my bank roll larger, strain former Camaro
Hot dite Charger
Gerry Guardian seats
Green light Shlick rims

Cause they girlfriend wanna jump in they don't wanna fuck me man
These hoes got a car fetish
But lets roll (roll roll roll)

You probably thought that someone threw a grenade or something
You trynna' say you wasn't impressed please save it woman
Got you all up in the seat getting naked wantin' to make out
But you better not get no make-up on em'
These car jackers wanna follow me then take it from me
I got some heat up under my seat waitin' on us
So why your face still funny homie you jealous of me
Cause I pull up on the scene so elegantly
Me and Mike P. together and we killin' the beat

In my old school bumpin' that ""Kiss of Life"" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
'Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And that was real when they said the limit is the sky
But my feets on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it 'cause, when it rain, it pour
But now the storm finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money 'cause it cost to grind
Silly beats being burnt up with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest island, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I'll be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You could say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
'Cause runaways for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, from a kid up was straight

This ain't no ordinary, dog
I was sick of being poor and said enough
Right up 85 North, I never was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word 'cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing off the torch I carry
Got annoyed from every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the backseat bass and the lobster bisk
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown

I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on 'er
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular, Bat-mobile look like Dracula
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it

I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
'Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone

Matter fact, you can bring a friend

Henny bottles on my table

Girls lookin' at me like I got a halo
I don't do second dates, that's just how the game go
Look at my life, I made that shit
Look at my car, I suede that shit
Replay that shit

We be partying like we in Cancun
Double shots of the Avion with no lime to chase
'Bout to bite the slate clean and ride the wave

Some purple liquid in my cup, no Welch's grape
I got a couple more notches in my belt to make
I gave that bitch my number
I ain't sittin' around waitin' for my cell to ring
And that's a lost cause
Our squad
Messin' up the room leavin' drawers, bras
Layin' on the floor, leaving' bars, straws
Layin' on the table by the vase, y'all
Lookin' at me like you seen a star

Never seemed to have no dough

You're gamblin' with your own happiness
And most all your would be friends
Turn out so phoney
Oh but times they change
And rearrange

And I'll sing to the Queen of Hearts
Don't know where to start
Or how to stop

And after things have come and gone
Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I wasted so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
T'Leave it lay just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find it gone

I love you queen of Hearts
Tell me not to stop
Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

And after all that we've been through
I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through
And in my heart
There's only you
And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange piece of mind
Without it there'd be
Lonely me and
Oh darlin' lonely you

Tell me when to start

Mike Renzi,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berekeley Square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

That night in Berkeley Square.",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,1991

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day

What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark

The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?
Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

Was it worth keeping? We never will know
There might have been a sky of blue for me and you
We'll never know
There might have been a garden, too, where roses grew
We'll never know
We might have built a castle high
For you were young and so was I
But we just kissed and said ""Goodbye""
And so 
We'll never know

And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come [*],1988
Mike Richmond,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too
",Emily,1989
Mike Richmond,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
 
Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
",The Lamp Is Low,1994

Mike Rimbaud,"Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last
Night now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

[Chorus]
Everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got in too deep and I could not pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bough us two tickets on that Coast City bus

[Chorus]

Now our luck may have died and out love may
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything dies
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm
Gonna do a little favor for him
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday
Comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City",Atlantic City,2003
Mike Robinson,"Je t'écris des mots purs
J'ai gommé les ratures
Et là sur le papier j'ai effacé tes fautes
Au fur et à mesure

C'est pas d'la grande écriture
Juste un peu de lecture
Quelques instants volés
Qui se sont envolés
Au fur et à mesure

Et si le facteur assure
Avec deux fois rien
On peut aller très loin
Je serai là demain

Et de tes mains
Tu vas me décolleter
Me décacheter
Et me déshabiller
Au fur et à mesure

Je n'suis pas vraiment sûre
Qu'aucune éclaboussure
De tes yeux jaillira
Lorsque tu me liras
Au fur et à mesure

D'aventure en rupture
J'ai connu des fractures
Mais ma plus belle bavure
C'est de t'avoir laissé
Au fur et à mesure

Et si le facteur assure
Avec deux fois rien
Tu peux aller plus loin
Tu seras là demain

Et de mes mains
Te désenvelopper
Te décacheter
Et te déshabiller
Au fur et à mesure

Et si le facteur assure
Avec deux fois rien
On peut aller très loin
On sera là demain

Et de nos mains
Se désenvelopper
Se décacheter
Et se déshabiller
Au fur et à mesure

Je t'écris des mots purs
J'ai gommé les ratures
Et là sur le papier j'ai effacé mes fautes
Au fur et à mesure",Au Fur et a Mesure,1999
