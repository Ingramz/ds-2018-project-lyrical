Evocation,"Broken bones
Shattered temple bleeding wound bleed more
Beatless heart
Blackened clouds pounding rain rains more

I'll fight the pain
But all the time I fight it just hurts more

Strengthless feed
Sarcastic romance smiling clown that grieves
Horror dawn
Unshaped shadows lurking now hordes

So show me dead calm chaos",Dead Calm Chaos,2008
Evocation,"Razored To The Bone
Imagine your future like the truth was not told
Ahead lies destruction salvation ignored
The vast generation some found an empty throne
Same people claim they are razored to the bone

Razored to the bone

Chained are all saviours and tame are no lords
Succeed with your passion die by the sword
Lost in temptation destructed fuck up close
Trash doomed messiah razored to the bone",Razored to the Bone,2008
Evocation,"Beneath the formations in stone
Fragments of evil corrode
Tragic creation in rust
Fire in rain it explodes
Inside our dead blind mind
Our mutiny unfolds
Above the blood red line
It grows

We face the storm we face our death
As dark we form apocalyptic
Bringers of pain dark arise
Riders of doom now united
Crushing and raping our thoughts
We die in our darkness so blind
Inside the dead born kind
Apocalyptic we find
Beneath the darkest sky 
We die",Apocalyptic,2010
Evocation,"Confession grows
From stains inside of me
As darkness calls
It craves me to reveal
Force in the darkness, soak in the sin
Play with the demons revealed
Bestial eruption curse of the plague
Bounded protection dissolved
A force sadistic
We found upon its blame
Seductive call
Our addiction guides us all
Reflection throws

Its darker side to see
A broken patience
Resistance to believe
We broken bastards
Pale by our own
Our restless fever
Has burnt it all
Curse on the creature
That seeks and finds us hiding
Curse on that creature
That sees our inner deeds
And force us to retreat",Curse on the Creature,2010
Evocation,"The panic seize me through
As the dark side takes control
Now the blame towards me
It raptures my soul
We longed for his arise
Found the mad man in his eyes
Hate regardless towards all
A ruleless battle we fought
Die in darkness consume me whole
A vast invasion a last formation
Damnation frame no destination train

Black is our answer we drown in its shade
When careless I lost my soul
I lost salvation in its cold
How the pain gained control
Down tortured us all
One day we will die
In the darkness in the night
Lit our fire feel it burn
As time heals no more
We pray for mandatory
Protection from its blade
Red eyes from blood vision
Destruction flames our graves",Infamy,2010
Evocation,"Murder in passion
Now death is on its way
Shadowed obsession
Her darkest obey
Murder in passion
Intruder found wrong
Too dark was her session
Then her lonely hours seemed to grow
I dived into her hollow thoughts

I drowned in misery
Murder in passion
Precede the delete
When facing destruction
No forgiveness she leaves
Murder in passion
Was hiding among
So cold was our session
Soon our passion ceased to grow
So I fell into her holocaust
The construction made me fall",Murder in Passion,2010
Evocation,"Burn off them leaches
Bleed out the filth from your skin
Stone all the preachers
Hunt them until they all fall
Drench them in fire and see them all burn
Bow for no masters
Loneliness gives you more strength
Left is the failure release of the beast
Bastards who do you think you are

Bastard, what is left for me
Rotten is what's your lifeline is
We do not need to preach
Kill all the weakness
Fade all the fear deep inside
Clean of the dust
Freedom in sight gained control
We spit in the face of the filth
Parasites
 
We burn all your churches
We burn all your lies",Parasites,2010
Evocation,"Psychosis warfare
In deepest tombs
Our helpless saviors
Divide our minds in half
Brightless human
Mind left blank
Empty landscape
Runs a sword in thee
Utopia gone inside our selves
For nothing we feed our darkest thoughts

Distant shallows swarms our inner truths
Obliteration frames our naked walls
And stains our memory more
Breathe your enemy
Loose your sane
Target midways
Follows with watching eyes
Heartless movement
Breathless room
Darkened worlds
Flamed inside our cells",Psychosis Warfare,2010
Evocation,"Cast aside with broken shield
I was abandoned by my god
Left as dirt among the lonely race
It painted dark my space
Open wound from a dagger hand
Left open for no cause

Rewinded thoughts I endlessly gazed
I found conviction in it's claws
Reunion in war
Traumatic point in a useless breath
I'm choking on its curse
Faded role into dark absence

I was divided into half
A serpent's sting and a spit within
Soon the poison starts its search
Open casket headless bones
And my fight revived much worse

It tortures my thoughts
It leaves me in vain
It tortures my nights
It drives me insane
Failure and frustration",Reunion In War,2010
Evocation,"Aimed at with precision
I'm lost inside your tuf
The faceless demolition
My antichrist rebirth
When stranded in between
Reboot me

I'm aiming, I hod the trigger I'm your victim
My battle now reformed
It follows my direction
It consumes me whole
It stains my crucifixion

It calms my soul
I'm a target in you distance
Your eyes observe my moves
Forgiveness through devastation
The penetration drills its hole
 
Sweet obsession, dark and cold
Chain me in you deep vaults
Sweet obsession chills my blood
Embrace me in your shade once more",Sweet Obsession,2010
Evocation,"We spill our guts and drain our souls
A broken world refined in sin
We hit and bash to break our bones
Brick by brick we crack them stones
As darkness lays its shade
Infected wounds fight
We all unite from pain
We are unified insane
Intoxicated last in line
Losers stand to gain no more
Manipulated guided blind
Inch by inch abused by all
 
Hang me in sacred gardens
Leave my corpse to show
Kill me in sacred gardens
Breath my empty whole
Spill me in sacred gardens
Leave my guts to float
End me in sacred gardens
Erase all trace from me",We Are Unified Insane,2010

Evoken,"Is this our last chance to say all we have to say
Hiding here inside ourselves we live our lives afraid
So close your eyes and just believe in everything your told
Cause in this land of great confusion it's easy to give up control

Strange world people talk and tell only lies
Strange world people kill an eye for an eye
Strange world dream one-day we'll see the light
Strange world believe and everything will be alright

And this is the place where everything begins and ends again
No secrets left to find no seven deadly sins
This world that we have wasted has kept us very well
When science now is sacred who will save us from ourselves

Strange world people talk and tell only lies
Strange world people kill an eye for an eye
Strange world dream one-day we'll see the light

Strange world people talk sometimes I wonder why
Strange world people kill still no-one hears their cries
Strange world burn these thoughtless tears out of my eyes

EvoKids,"Down by the bay,
Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,
For if I do,
My mother will say:

Did you ever see a snake, baking a cake?

Did you ever see a cat, wearing a hat?

Did you ever see a whale, with a polka dot tail?

Did you ever see a bear combing her hair?

Evolution,"My fingers burn in the breakdown
This part of everything behind me

Crushing every feeling that's in me

These walls you've built never come down

Lights flicker still in your eyes

You hear things that you can't see
Echoes on and off
Thoughts spinning out of me
What's your impulse for me?

Time never leaves until it's over
Shadow falling never stay
Deep treble lights that they cover
Softly slipping down my face

Echoes on and off

Evolver,"I've always heard there is a land
Beyond the mortal dreams of man
Where every tear will be left behind
But it must be in another time, oh

There'll be an everlasting light
Shining a purest holy white
And every fear will be erased
But it must be in another place, oh, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place

I've grown tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time, oh

And though I've put my trust in Christ
And felt His spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place, oh, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place
I'm gonna be swept away, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place
Another time, another place

Evon Bailey,"Time is never on our side
Beauty reaches for the light
From the shadow of your smile
Into my arms

There's a flower in my field you know
Holding love up like a shield
Now I know we have it sealed
Here in my heart

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

Where the stream begins to flow
A life of love that springs you know
From every word
Into my soul

Treasure buried deep inside
Turns the hands way back in time you know
Leaving all our past behind
Can we let it go?

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

We've been holding on
For things to change
The fear is gone
We've turned the page

In the book of love
And to know this love
Is to own it all 
From high above

I feel the call
Of your love

What can I do?

EVVY,"I missed your arms around me
Now you found me, and we're floating off the ground
When I used to pass the hours, I was lost
But baby, now it's slowing down

I try to sink in the sound
The secret place that I found my voice in you (ah)
I looked all over your face
To find the reason it makes me feel so damn new

Our hearts forever glowing, there's something in your motion
I never saw the view, I swerve to collide with you
You're like a new creation, now there's no hesitation
There's nothing I can do, I swerve to collide with you

Your lips, they used to haunt me, but now you want me
And I'm falling off the ground
You took the fears that I made up
And now I'm not afraid of falling down

My arms wait for your call
I run to tear down your walls and I break through (ah)
I burned the bridges I crossed
To the secret place that I lost my heart in you

Our hearts forever glowing, there's something in your motion
I never saw the view, I swerve to collide with you
You're like a new creation, now there's no hesitation
There's nothing I can do, I swerve to collide with you

Oh, I crash into you and I'm better being broken
And you got me moving to your heartbeat, to your heartbeat

Ewan MacColl,"In the morning we built the city 
In the afternoon walked through its streets 
Evening saw us leaving 

We wandered through our days as if they would never end 
All of us imagined we had endless time to spend 
We hardly saw the crossroads and small attention gave 
To landmarks on the journey from the cradle to the grave, 
cradle to the grave, cradle to the grave 

Did you learn to dream in the morning? 
Abandon dreams in the afternoon? 
Wait without hope in the evening? 

Did you stand there in the traces and let 'em feed you lies? 
Did you trail along behind them wearing blinkers on your eyes? 
Did you kiss the foot that kicked you, did you thank them for 
their scorn? 
Did you ask for their forgiveness for the act of being born, 
act of being born, act of being born? 

Did you alter the face of the city? 
Make any change in the world you found? 
Or did you observe all the warnings? 

Did you read the trespass notices, did you keep off the grass? 
Did you shuffle up the pavements just to let your betters pass? 
Did you learn to keep your mouth shut, were you seen but never heard? 
Did you learn to be obedient and jump to at a word, 
jump to at a word, jump to at a word? 

Did you demand any answers? 
The who and the what and the reason why? 
Did you ever question the setup? 

Did you stand aside and let 'em choose while you took second best? 
Did you let 'em skim the cream off and give to you the rest? 
Did you settle for the shoddy and did you think it right 
To let 'em rob you right and left and never make a fight, 
never make a fight, never make a fight? 

What did you learn in the morning? 
How much did you know in the afternoon? 
Were you content in the evening? 

Did they teach you how to question when you were at the school? 
Did the factory help you, were you the maker or the tool? 
Did the place where you were living enrich your life and then 
Did you reach some understanding of all your fellow men, 
all your fellow men, all your fellow men? ",Ballad of Accounting,1996
Ewan MacColl,"I found my love where the gaslight falls
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town

Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Springs a girl in the streets at night
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I heard her sigh from the decks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I'm going to take a good sharp ax
Shining steel tempered in the fire
We'll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town",Dirty Old Town,1996
Ewan MacColl,"Farewell, you northern hills, you mountains all goodbye
Moorlands and stony ridges, crags and peaks, goodbye
Glyder Fach farewell, cold big Scafell, cloud-bearing Suilven
Sun-warmed rocks and the cold of Bleaklow's frozen sea
The snow and the wind and the rain of hills and mountains
Days in the sun and the tempered wind and the air like wine
And you drink and you drink till you're drunk on the joy of living 

Farewell to you, my love, my time is almost done
Lie in my arms once more until the darkness comes
You filled all my days, held the night at bay, dearest companion
Years pass by and they're gone with the speed of birds in flight
Our lives like the verse of a song heard in the mountains
Give me your hand and love and join your voice with mine
And we'll sing of the hurt and the pain and the joy of living

Farewell to you, my chicks, soon you must fly alone
Flesh of my flesh, my future life, bone of my bone
May your wings be strong may your days be long safe be your journey
Each of you bears inside of you the gift of love
May it bring you light and warmth and the pleasure of giving
Eagerly savour each new day and the taste of its mouth
Never lose sight of the thrill and the joy of living

Take me to some high place of heather, rock and ling
Scatter my dust and ashes, feed me to the wind
So that I may be part of all you see, the air you are breathing
I'll be part of the curlew's cry and the soaring hawk,
The blue milkwort and the sundew hung with diamonds
I'll be riding the gentle breeze as it blows through your hair
Reminding you how we shared in the joy of living",The Joy of Living,1996
Ewan MacColl,"I've been over Snowdon, I've slept upon Crowdon
I've camped by the Waynestones as well
I've sunbathed on Kinder, been burned to a cinder
And many more things I can tell
My rucksack has oft been me pillow
The heather has oft been me bed
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

Ch:     I'm a rambler, I'm a rambler from Manchester way
        I get all me pleasure the hard moorland way
        I may be a wageslave on Monday
        But I am a free man on Sunday

The day was just ending and I was descending
Down Grinesbrook just by Upper Tor
When a voice cried ""Hey you"" in the way keepers do
He'd the worst face that ever I saw
The things that he said were unpleasant
In the teeth of his fury I said
""Sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead""

He called me a louse and said ""Think of the grouse""
Well i thought, but I still couldn't see
Why all Kinder Scout and the moors roundabout
Couldn't take both the poor grouse and me
He said ""All this land is my master's""
At that I stood shaking my head
No man has the right to own mountains
Any more than the deep ocean bed

I once loved a maid, a spot welder by trade
She was fair as the Rowan in bloom
And the bloom of her eye watched the blue Moreland sky
I wooed her from April to June
On the day that we should have been married
I went for a ramble instead
For sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

So I'll walk where I will over mountain and hill
And I'll lie where the bracken is deep
I belong to the mountains, the clear running fountains
Where the grey rocks lie ragged and steep
I've seen the white hare in the gullys
And the curlew fly high overhead
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead.",The Manchester Rambler,1996
Ewan MacColl,"My old man was a good old man
Skilled in the moulding trade
In the stinking heat of the iron foundry
My old man was made
Down on his knees in the moulding sand
He wore his trade like a company brand
He was one of the cyclops' smoky band
Yes, that was my old man

My old man wasn't really old
It's just that I was young
And anybody over twelve years old
Was halfway to the tomb
He was loyal to his workmates all his life
Gave his pay packet to his wife
Had a few jars on a Saturday night
Yes, that was my old man

My old man was a union man
Fought hard all his days
He understood the system
And was wise to the boss' ways
He says, you want what's yours by right
You have to struggle with all your might
They'll rob you blind if you don't fight
Yes, that was my old man

My old man was a proud old man
At home on the foundry floor
Until the day they laid him off
And showed him to the door
They gave him his card, said, things are slack
We've got a machine can learn the knack
Of doing your job, so don't come back
The end of my old man

My old man he was fifty-one
What was he to do?
A craftsman moulder on the dole
In nineteen thirty-two
He felt he'd given all he could give
So he did what thousands of others did
Abandoned hope and the will to live
They killed him, my old man

My old man he is dead and gone
Now I am your old man
And my advice to you, my son
Is to fight back while you can
Watch out for the man with the silicon chip
Hold on to your job with a good firm grip
'Cause if you don't you'll have had your chips
The same as my old man
",My Old Man,1996
Ewan MacColl,"She walks in the cold dark hour before the morning
The hour when wounded night begins to bleed
Stands at the back of the patient queue
The silent almost sweeping queue
Seein' no-one and not being seen

Working shoes are wrapped in working apron
Rolled in an oilcloth bag across her knees
The swaying tremor soaks the morning
Blue grey steely day is dawning
Draining the last few dregs of sleep away

Over the bridge and the writhing foul black water
Down through empty corridors of stone
Each of the blind glass walls she passes
Shows her twin in sudden flashes
Which is the mirror image, which is real?

Crouching hooded gods of word and number?
Accept her bent-backed homage as their due
The buckets steam like incense coils
Around the endless floor she toils
Cleaning the same white sweep each day anew

Glistening sheen of new-washed floors is fading
There where office clocks are marking time
Night's black tide has ebbed away
By cliffs of glass awash with day
She hurries from her labours still unseen

He who lies besides her does not see her
Nor does the child who once lay at her breast
The shroud of self-denial covers
Eager girl and tender lover
Only the faded servant now is left

How could it be that no-one saw her drowning
How did we come to be so unaware
At what point did she cease to be her
When did we cease to look and see her
How is it no-one knew she was there",Nobody Knew She Was There,1996
Ewan MacColl,"With our nets and gear we're faring
     On the wild and wasteful ocean.
     Its there that we hunt and we earn our bread
     As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O it was a fine and a pleasant day
Out of Yarmouth harbor I was faring
As a cabinboy on a sailing lugger
For to go and hunt the shoals of herring

O the work was hard and the hours long
And the treatment, sure it took some bearing
There was little kindness and the kicks were many
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

O we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank
I was cook and I'd a quarter sharing
And I used to sleep standing on my feet
And I'd dream about the shoals of herring

O we left the homegrounds in the month of June
And to Canny Shiels we soon were bearing
With a hundred cran of silver darlings
That we'd taken from the shoals of herring

Now you're up on deck, you're a fisherman
You can swear and show a manly bearing
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows
While you're searching for the shoals of herring

In the stormy seas and the living gales
Just to earn your daily bread you're daring
From the Dover Straits to the Faroe Islands
As you're following the shoals of herring

O I earned my keep and I paid my way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes
We were sailing after shoals of herring",The Shoals of Herring,1996
Ewan MacColl,"A-Tisket A-Tasket
A green and yellow basket
I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace

Ewan McGregor,"We're not safe until he's dead
He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger's just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast

Ewan McGregor,"There's something sweet, and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear, and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New, and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought? Well, bless my soul, Well, who'd have known?

Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?

It's so peculiar, wait and see, we'll wait and see a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Here's a thought, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before

There may be something there that wasn't there before

Ewan McLennan,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Ewan Svensson,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2002

Murda murda I wrote it in braile
Uncut, lyrical dope, certified by my scale
The homicide rapper, there'll never be another after
The Mac's rapture, I represent, that's what I'm on the map for
Who the fuck gonna fuck with the scandalous
1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss
?Platonic?, the lyrical killins don't got no motives
In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river
I enter the place, ski mask covered my face
If they pass me the mic, I'm gonna catch a case
In this mothafucka ya heard of me

Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

I minister, words of a mothafuckin sinister
Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya
Nigga put me in the game I'ma show you my sports
Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated

Ex-It,"So stack it up and let me show you how to set it straight
This lovely dove on the line it's time to make or break
Floors and jaws and doors is what it's all about
Give me your body it's that time to make you jump and shout
Wine and dine and find what you're looking for
I got to show you it's that time to open up the door
So keep it real and feel what you're looking for
Just like I told you when you love you gots' to make it raw

Morning afternoon and night
We lay together side by side
Searching for lust, searching for breath
Searching for the touch of life
No words are spoken, the only sound we hear is
Body talk, body talk

The heat of passion is such a beautiful thing
As it overflows pleasure grows
All the dreams it can bring
Your lust in my eyes a gentle size
Body talk (uh, it's just a love thing)
Body talk (yeah, make it real baby)

For play on tray we never gonna make it wack
We play I say show you that the loving's back
Just like I showed from the start we're gonna play it right
Throw up your hands and make it wild cause it's outta sight
We're dropping bombs in the mix can you hear me right
Get up and pick up a rhyme cause you know the honey's fine
Wait up date up it's time to get this faith up
Brothers knocking boots and the ladies playing stay up

So keep it real and make it known
That love will always glide
I got to take it to the top this is the reason why
Free expression not aggression
We have become-one

Now that we got you straight tripping
It's time to make a move
We got's you groove running smooth flex without you boo

Back drop flex it time to shake and fake it huh",Body Talk,1996

You had the ball then you dropped it then fuck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don’t let yourself be the next kiss opponent
No I ain't driving but yeah bitch I own it

I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones half ones even zips moving
We ain't even gonna talk about the bricks moving
Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin
Hard times come you just gotta get through 'em

But not happy with that they took my brother the government kidnap and shit
I ain't just talking I ain't just rapping said it really happened
That’s why I get on shit that you with and I vomit
I don’t give a fuck you know how Exo coming

I make it look like you put time in for nothing

O que fiz pela música

Nós somos do tempo do samba
Sem grana, sem glória
Não se discute talento
Nem seu argumento
Me faça o favor

Respeite quem pode chegar
Onde a gente chegou
E a gente chegou muito bem
Sem desmerecer a ninguém

Enfrentando no peito um certo preconceito
E muito desdém
Hoje em dia é fácil dizer
Essa música é nossa raiz

Tá chovendo de gente
Que fala de samba
E não sabe o que diz
Por isso vê lá onde pisa
Respeite a camisa que a gente suou

Respeite quem pode chegar
Onde a gente chegou
E quando chegar no terreiro procure primeiro
Saber quem eu sou

Respeite quem pode chegar
Onde a gente chegou

O pai dela ficou grilado
Depois que me conheceu
Até entendo ele, pois tá tudo bagunçado
O mundo está desvirtuado
Mas não é problema seu

Será que ele nunca amou 
Do jeito que eu a amo
Tô apaixonado eu não tô brincando
Tô tão dependente
Tô carente, é quente
Veja como estou

Será que porque é pretinho e é pagodeiro
Mas teu coração é forte, é guerreiro
Vai provar pra ele que merece esse amor, esse amor

Eu sou capaz de fazê-la feliz
E nada é capaz de me impedir

Good morning

How can ten hours feel like ten years? 
I cry ten men's tears as it disappears 
With the passionate atmosphere 
Took your glove as a souvenir 
Left the other on the pillow as I stroked your ear 
One last breath of your hair, stared for a second

thought I'd take that chance

In a dark place but I loved the karma sutra

knew it'd all end it tears I,

Sprint down the street and we don't pay the fare
Onto the district line, force open the door
There's loadsa seats free but we cotch on the floor

Last night we both died a death
Just flowed til no cider left
Jumped out the wrong side of bed
Now another night of wrong lies ahead, ha
To be a kid again, Nancy and Sid again
Need medicine, cut out the middle men
Run free, only way to get rid of them
Never gonna catch us

We're on the run
And I'm about to lose it
Shes like a gun
And she ain't afraid to use it

Light our very last flames
And we'll knock it all back and forget our names
Cos its our last night
And its one last fight
We're the last ones
The last ones standing

Go tell the waitress, we'll have 2 rum and cokes
Ask for the bill and then we'll split when she goes
Out the fire exit wearing some strangers coat
We'll sing it out til we're sore in the throat

This ain't child's play like pass the parcel or
Build a castle, just a couple of rascals who
Go harder, live faster
Fight til the end like Jason's Argonauts
Cos life's a carnival
There's no reason, motives marginal
Don't care if we're cold and starvin'
We'll still be laughin' when

Example,"Yo, I know what I'm tryna say is on the tip of my tongue
It's like my thoughts have been erased, that's all as if I was dumb
I should of met her when she asked, I was out getting plastered
She waited for my speech but the cat got my tongue

Acting like I've gone and won at the Oscars, speechless
Careful with my words there's no way I can cheat this
Lost 'em again, now someone give me a pen
I need to write these lessons down and maybe give 'em to friends

I can't promise that I won't be a fool again
But I never had cruel intentions
Put me in detention as long as you want
Then you'll see

There's a million words but it's never enough
I say, 'I love you', 'I'm sorry' but still I get stuck
If I had a coin for every time, we could be millionaires
But you don't need the diamonds
'Cause I got a million ways to show you that I care

She isn't in it for the cash flow, the girl's independent
She don't expect pendants or remnants or necklaces
She only wants to trust me and don't want to fuss me
But all of this depends on whether I behave recklessly

I never meant to lie to her, the truth wouldn't hurt
But I just dig myself into a hole and she goes berserk
Lost it again, who'd have thought that us men
Would break down when we fell and behave like we're 10?

I can't promise that I won't be a fool again
But I never had cruel intentions
You put me in the dark house as long as you want
Then you'll see

There's a million words but it's never enough
I say, 'I love you', 'I'm sorry' but still I get stuck
If I had a coin for every time, we could be millionaires
But you don't need the diamonds
'Cause I got a million ways to show you that I care

I should be raising the bar high, avoiding the bar low
I'll write a million songs for you as if I was Barlow
'Cause you're my Bridget Bardot, my precious cargo
I'm tryna speak my mind but I don't get very far though

Say something inappropriate and look like a fool
In my head it sounded funny but your face says it all
I'll probably lose you again for a day, maybe 10
We're broken for a minute, doesn't mean it's the end

There's a million words but it's never enough
I say, 'I love you', 'I'm sorry' but still I get stuck

Example,"I got someone waiting at home for me, staring out the door
And I'll wanna stay in the zone till 3, all those calls ignored
Tomorrow she'll probably disown me, happy no more,
Keep falling into shadows,

I'm playing in the shadows all night long,
So good to play with bad girls I'm still young,
They keep on saying hello, I know what they want,
You'll find me in the shadows

She's always ringing my phone you see, laying down the law,
Keep trying to speak to her honestly, so she knows the score,
Maybe one day I'll be lonely, knocking down the door,
Keep falling into shadows,

Example,"We took it all apart but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't wanna call it too early

Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts

Down that one way road to oblivion

Sometimes the right words don't surface
Shut up pretend it's all perfect
Brain short circuits so

Marked by the devil living his power

You'll meet the ruler face to face
To be slain by the knives of God
Your blood will flow through the caverns of Earth
Back to hell your soul will go

On the day you die
You'll demand death to all
Three days of darkness
And the world cracks and faults
Under the cross your shadow appears
With the knives shoved deep as you burn
Thunder cracks the sky

Are driving me mad

It cries for revenge
I know it's the end

There's no returning back
From the dreams that I now have
Voices of demons
Shouting out with laughter
Now I'm screaming in pain
My heart is pounding faster

I'm crying out with fear

Has he possessed my mind?
Has he come to live in me
To crucify and bury me?

Unholy terror deadly sin
The witching hour is growing near
The stroke of midnight the strike of fear

With sacred knife held tight in your hand
The maiden lies beneath where you stand
Mystic chants command you this night
She's a victim of sacrifice

Witches burn in hell
Dead men don't live to tell
Of torture and evil rights
They're victims of sacrifice

We are the victims burned at the stake
All of the innocent died in your place
Black magic rules the deep within your heart
I'll take your soul and I'll tear it apart

Crosses mark the space
Where terror took its place
Witches rule the night
When evil takes its bite

You're the sinner you're the fool
You have the power to break the rules
Your day is coming you wait and see
You'll burn in fire like the others and me

Walk into the circle candles at your feet
Resurrected now submission is weak
I'll raise the dead who's blood you'll drink
You know it's too late now later than you think

The nearer you get to hell
Witches cast their spells
The chosen pay the price
Like victims of sacrifice

Gasp thin air, realize the end is near
They buried me when I was alive!:

Cause of death was never confirmed
Did he really die?

To save his precious life

Force of pressure in my brain

Are they real, or wishful thinking lies?

Padded prison, living tomb
Silent hell in which I wake!
Scream in fear, no one can hear

A man who thought of horrid things
But really sought what happiness brings 
Terror instilled within the souls
Of men and women, young and old 
Come and listen to me, my friend 
He'll make your morale descend 

One Boston day, it's sad to say
A newborn child was granted miserable life 
Abandoned by his father and
Left alone by death of father's wife 

Foster child 
Tobacco exporter gave him a chance 
History defiled 
Twisted by literature, dark and opium enhanced 
Irregularity 
So far ahead of his time 
A spark of a breed
Regarding all of his literature creed 

Infamy of tales and poetry 
Connecting his themes to his wildest dreams 

The maelstrom grew but no one knew 
He descended far beyond its spinning walls 
Into the pit, the black abyss 
His house was collapsing as he searched for El Dorado 

Perched upon Pallas was life, hard and callous
The shadows of burden lifted nevermore 
The vulture eye of death concealed
By wooden planks below the floor 
The quest for solace evolved into sorrow 
Lingering obsessions 
Intoxication, stimulation, creation 
Hindering addictions 

Apparently the message in a bottle was lost
For I could see no conclusion 
But all of us remaining in the shrouded past
Must remember to further ourselves by obtrusion 

Inebriated grin leads the mighty pen
Across the paper as his fears come alive 
Satiric whim ignites the brim
Of insanity as Pluto arrives 
Swaying cognac barriers
And the beating of his hideous heart
Increasing ever so constantly 
Conjuring the ne'er forgotten lore

Through the shields of darkness where they find

A song to while away the long sojourn in the hearse
Yet all of us who danse macabre to these dour, dismal tunes
Become cold, grim and hard as the dirt upon the tomb
In darkened dirges death's knell peals out it's toll
As another cadaver is consigned six feet down to its hole
But ere the last shovel of dirt falls on the wall of the box
We gravely offer a salute to those about to rot
So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead
Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid
As from our mouths the melody is bled, in a symphony scripted in red
Like rats by the piper we're led, to join in this song for the dead

The humor of the gallons never fails to ring true
In this dead, bleak, sick world that we're hung, drawn and quartered though
As each internecine instrument plays its own bloody part
The hammering of coffin nails outpaces the beating of our hearts
Symphonic surgery orchestrated, a cleaver conducts
The execrable epiphany comes too late, just to reduce us to chunks
Rising up from the sod heaves a gross, putrid breath
As the chorus is joined in this song for the dead
So lift up your severed heads, in a song for the dead
Life's course ever runs red, so let no lyric remain unsaid

Mutilating the melody's method and means
The crepitated coda dies in mid-refrain
As the sheet-music is obscured by a sanguine scarlet stain
Shattered stave lodged in your split-open splattered brain
The ruptured meter falters as the bow is fretted once again
Acrid arias are screeched
The bloated thorax is breached
Abrading viscera with bleach
Grotesquely gavage the deceased

Cleaving the clef
Broken notes bleed into a mess
Falling on ears so deaf
So it ever is in death
Carbonized cantatas corrupt, ringing out, sewing seeds of dischord and
Dismay
Suppurated sonatas erupt, Purulent pizzicatos slicing every which way
The truncated cadence is sundered, Bloody scraps of sheet music
Unintellibly scrawled
Threnodies resonate six feet under, To where all life's fractured melodies
Will finally resolve
The symphonic slaughter's swells without restraint
As the cacophonous cadenza splits your eardrums clean in twain

柔らかな人の温もりさえ
忘れてしまった
金色の雨降り注ぎ 乾いた心溶かせ
永遠の前の静かな一秒
愛という名のもと
きっとめぐりあえる
生まれたままの たいせつな
Heart of Gold
どれくらいの 時がたてば
この大地に 花は咲くの
奪い合って 憎しみあう
一人よがりの 汚れた夢
正しいと誤魔化し続け
いつも誰かのせいにして
血まみれの両手を掲げ
子供を抱きしめる
金色の星降り注ぎ
地図にない道を示す
永遠の海に 今船を出すよ
伝えたい想いがある
忘れないこの時を
愛をもう一度 取り戻そう
Heart of Gold
気づかずに 誰かを傷つけ
迷い込んだ夜は
振り向けば 足跡さえ
残さないまま 消えていった
金色の時降り注ぎ
悲しみの過去を消す
手をつなぎ合って 幸せを待つよ
隠さないこの気持ち
抱きしめたい君のこと
素直な気持ち 愛を告げる

Till I I heard you cry so close
Yes, I was thinking of suicide,suicide.
Your face,there in the mirror
Your sigh,vision in my head
Goin? mad,is there someone else? Someone else?
Is there something more that I can say?

I can say,I can say,I feel you closer
I can say,I can say,is the something more that
I can say,I can say

Are we living on a razor?
Is this predestination?
I?m confusing what is real,what is real
Something,something is controlling
Calling,crawling in my skin
I say,is there someone else?

Is there something more that I can say?

I can say,I can say,I feel you closer
I can say,I can say,is the something more that

I never had a lucky star

I see, I see the pistols now
Hanging low on leather belts
I see cops forming a police line
I hear shots making world headline
There?s a war on what I believe in,
There a source for the pain in my head,
Everyday of my life
They push me right to the edge and they scream

Jump,it?s just another day
Jump,it?s just another day

I don't want to let you down

But I will never let you down

When nothing seems to make sense 
When you’re feeling so small

For every night I should have slept
I drem well without a bed

Should I do the right things?
Should I do what I think?

Shout louder when I shout
Run faster when I run
Let me live out every day like it was the last one
If,if you don?t understand
Take me as I am
Let me live out every day like it was the last one

For every day I didn?t work
I got a job singing this song
For every rule I shouldn?t break,If I can,well I do
For every friend who was no friend
I got my dog
For every lesson that I missed
I got it myself

Let me live out every day like it was the last one

Should I take my own away
Should I take my own away

Run faster when I run

What I give you what I can give you
What I got is what I got is just everything I am
I?m just an Underdog

Without protection
And now I got a mic it?s my reaction

Exmortus,"Breathe in the air
Make for the meadow and savor the grass, while it lasts
By and by
Spidery fingers of industry reach for the sky
Brick upon brick, stone upon stone, they grow
Choking the atmosphere, oh, so incredibly slowly
Sulphur and carbon and hydrogen sulphide and lime
Fever, corrosion, and cover your cities with grime

Something is killing the land before your eyes
And the sunshine
Is not to blame
Could be the insane, inhumane games we play
Day by day

Riddle and fool
Mushrooming home in a crowd, I'm alone
Close your eyes, lie still
You are a mountain stream and I am a hill
Far, far away
There is a field of blossom and bees and new mown hay

Then my boss called just to tell me
I'm late and he's giving my job away
Well I took me a walk to the liquor store
So I could drink away my blues
Spent my last ten bucks, then I dropped the bottle
And I broke it all over my shoes
So I got home to find the power's shut off,
There was someone knocking at my door
It was my landlord serving an eviction notice
'Cause my checks are bouncing off the floor
I pounded my head up against the wall
Thinking what else could go wrong
But this was only the beginning to a real bad day,
It wasn't gonna be a lot of fun

I knew I should have never gotten out of bed
'Cause of the rain cloud above my head
I'm down on my luck and it's plain to see
So tell me why does this happen to me?

When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours on me
When it rains it pours, and there's a storm moving in on me
When it rains it pours, raining down on only me
When it rains it pours, when it rains it pours

I drove across town to go see a friend
When I heard a siren on my tail
It turned out I had a warrant for my arrest
And I couldn't even post the bail
So I'm sittin' in a cell for 48 hours
Keepin' company with thieves and drunks
I'm free to go but my car's impounded
And I'm thinkin' 'bout becoming a monk
So I'm wandering around in a catatonic daze
Now barely a shell of a man
I look like I live out of a shopping cart
And I'm picking up aluminum cans
I staggered my way to an overpass
And fell to the dirt asleep
I figured out tomorrow is a new day
And maybe I could buy myself a life real cheap",When It Rains It Pours,1992
Exodus,"Your body lies without a twitch-can't move
Feeling gone, nothing to say or do
Still alive but you can't think or see
You're looking like a vegetable to me

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind

Time rolls by and you never paid the cost
Without your mind your body-it's lost
Should we help to keep you alive?
Now's the time to help you
Die!

The darkness lives forever
Within your mind
No dreams, no thoughts it's only
Endless time

I love the sound of pain
The more it hurts the better I feel

It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

[Chorus]
Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

[Chorus]

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine

There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.

Smoothed over by a stream
No ticking of a clock
Truly measures what that means

I think I love this woman's way
I think I love this woman's way she shimmers, the way she shines
The way she radiates
The way she lives, the way she loves
The way she never hates
Sometimes I think of all of this that can surround me
I know it all as being mine
But she kisses me and wraps herself around me
She gives me love, she gives me time
And I feel fine I feel fine
But time I cannot change
So here's to looking back
You know I drink a whole bottle of my pride
And I toast to change to keep these demons off my back
Just get these demons off my back

I want to radiate
I want to live, I want to love

Leads us to deceive the mother of mankind
Nature is our master, we serve her through our deeds
She teaches us that only death is guaranteed
If there was a hell, there must I ever be
Eternal life in heaven is but a fallacy
So if death is nothing, but a path to be trod
Walk with me and let me introduce you to your God

Come see an exhibition of atrocity
An ocean of eternity
One in which the shore you’ll never see
Or your God of make believe

You speak to the sky and no one answers back
And yet you wager the word of God is fact
The horrors we imagine in vivid clarity
Become a spectacle, your God’s atrocities
A mirror image, reflection of your soul
Just nature’s play, all her children have a role
God’s an actor, the world nature’s stage
Our fates are scripted like so many
Letters on a page

A composition of atrocity
The Story of Christianity
A fairy tale of tyranny
Recipe for catastrophe

Man’s inclination
Is to bend those who oppose to our will
Does your great creator think
The good are better made by ills?
Dream after dream, time after time
He who conquers endures
The grand design of the mother
We the disease, and her the cure

Unsatisfied longing for the slaughter
The master often slays her sons and her daughters
Death is but and undress of skin and of bone
When you return to her, no sins to atone

Hatch out

Tal vez era respeto al convento pero nunca se lo imaginaban que eran dos grandes contrabandistas que en sus barbas la droga pasaban el agente 
que estaba de turno en aquella inspección de nogales por lo visto no era muy creyente
Y enseguida empezó a preguntarles que de donde venían 
y que traiban dijo el jefe de los federales

Muy serenas contestan las monjas vamos rumbo de un orfanatorió 
Y las cajas que ve usted en la troca son tesitos 
Y leche de polvo destinados a los huerfanitos 
Y si usted no lo cree pues ni modo

Dijo el jefe de los federales voy a hacer el chequeo de rutina 
Yo les pido disculpa hermanitas pero quiero sacarme la espina 
Yo presiento que la leche en polvo ya se les convirtió en cocaína 
Con un gesto de burla el agente se arrimo y le dijo a las monjitas 
Yo lo siento por los huerfanitos ya no van a tomar su lechita 
Ahora dígame como se llaman si no es mucha molestia hermanitas 
Una dijo me llamo sor Juana la otra dijo me llamo sorpresa 
Y se alzaron el habito a un tiempo y sacaron unas metralletas 
Y mataron a los federales y se fueron en su camioneta

En Durango se buscan dos monjas ellas no han regresando al convento 
Y una cosa si les aseguro que llegaron con el cargamento 
Por ahí dicen que están muy pesadas y que viven allá en sacramento

Extol,"Blessed is he who has got
His transgressions forgiven
And his sins hidden
Blessed is the man whom the Lord
Do not ascribe misdeeds
And is without deceit in his spirit

Buried it deep inside
But soon a sprout came forth
It kept on growing
I couldn't hide
When I kept it to myself
Slowly my bones corroded
And my vitality vanished
Like in the summer dry

Too many people living this life
Who can take their guilt away?
Their minds are rotting
And causing an endless pain
Soon they are demented and put away

I confessed my sins to You
And did not hide my guilt
I said ""I want to confess my misdeeds to You""
And He took away my sin and guilt

He is my sanctuary

all in favor say, this is my callin'
no stallin' out on these

No, 'cause one of you is all the hoes that's owned by Domino
Here's somethin special, a vessel of sweet

the best will be gentle with thee

the pressure placed my head to her waist

she had to place it in my face, brown sugar and say don't waste it

Envasada al vacío como una mermelada,

Se debió mover el Amonal
Why al meter la napia en el camión
A tomar por culo dos why dos.

¡Qué sonrisa tan rara!

Bajo al infierno why el diablo me lee cuentos,
Yo solo canto why digo que son poesias
Why al momento me levanto de la cama
Why al cuarto de hora no tengo ganas de ná.
Hago un esfuerzo
Pa respirar pa fuera why luego pa por dentro,
Pa reventar haciendo mucho ruido,
Hay quien pensaba que era un nuevo Dios naciendo
Why era un peo de un exquisito cocido.

Para un poco quieto why ponte a la sombra Tomás.

why de volverme en puro hielo

why ni las ratas se la comieron.

Eydie Gorme,"When I think of Tom
I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
was sleeping on a hill

I remember this
And I always will
There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own","Hello, Young Lovers [From The King and I]",1958

An' starts to talk purty
Whatcha gonna do?

That your lips are like cherrys,
Or roses, or berries
Whatcha gonna do?
S'pposin' that he says
That yer sweeter than cream
and he's gotta have cream or die?
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?
Spit in his eye?

I'm jist a girl who cain't say no,
Cain't seem to say it at all

Nen I think of thet ol' golden rule,
And do fer him what he would do fer me!

In a sombrero and chaps
Soon as I sit on their laps
Somethin' inside of me snaps
I cain't say no!

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Till the stars that were there before return above you,

Eydie Gorme,"I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,

Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,1962
Eydie Gorme,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Like a friendly home the second time you call

There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

And I could hear laughing voices in the night

I don't want him,

Besides, there's plenty more
Where he came from!

I don't want him,
You can have him,

And he can go right back
Where he came from!

I could never make him happy,
He'd be better off with you!
I'm afraid I never loved him,
All I ever wanted to do was;

Run my fingers through his curly locks,
Mend his underwear and darn his socks;
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes,
Wipe his glasses when he read the news;
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch,
Mornings after when he's had too much!
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near,
Give him babies, one for every year!
So you see;

I don't wan' him,
You can have him,

And he can just return
Where he came from!

I would look a trifle silly,
Taking him away from you!
That was never my intention,
All I ever wanted to do was;

Close the window while he soundly slept,
Raid the icebox where the food is kept;
Cook a breakfast that would please him most,
Eggs and coffee snd some buttered toast;
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray,
after breakfast clear the things away;
Bring the papers, and when they've been read,
Spend the balance of the day in bed!

If you weren't so caught up in who you dick ride
You'd see the flaws in your so called generals(?) and crawl to this side
You misinterpret the purpose of what we do
Plus you probably mad that we get our props and no one's feelin you
But don't tell me how to rip this microphone bitch
If your advice was so nice, w'on't you apply it to your own shit?
The truth is I can do what you can't
Sellin' twenty thousand units hand to hand to the true fans
On top of that, freestyle and you'll get served
On top of that, all your friends know my words
I accomplished more than you will in your whole life by the time I was eighteen
Never workin' a 9 to 5, that's the E&A theme
And it's a must we constantly keep elevatin'(?) the hustle
The music, the ethic, muscle the movements the methods
Huh, what's wrong, you still don't get it? Still feel you're so gifted
Still think your sky has no limits?
It takes a minute to get rid of the cynics
But now each piece in it's place, so you can't fuck with us

The genius supreme team is the E&A
Believe that this year we receivin' MC and DJ kingship
Perceived as the most deviously seen in the media
Remedial critics don't give us love but we don't need 'em to
It ain't your weak reviews that keep people in shrink(?) with us
They leave our shows thinkin' what these kids do is unachieveable, and they right
You never in your life could do as much as we do with just two techs and a mic
I leave kids like Raymond O'Neill pissed
Cause he knows without me ain't no way he'll make it in this record biz'
How d'you advertise some shit I want or not, mention me
Fuck you and that ugly co(?), we goin' ghetto gold this spring
And anyone that begs to differ wait until this hits ya
The illest scriptures killin' listeners with the real elixir
For these Top 40 blowjobs packagin' a hit single
Ya'll flaunt pussy so hard it gives the average kids dick tingles
But who can keep your sick(?) with cuts to clot your ego trip
Beats that hit and speech that spits, raise a fist, throw a fit

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see through

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

Check it out now

This is a necessary change from the grim simple and plain
Gotta exercise that brain to break the chain pain is a part of gain
No need to explain
We innovate to generate an intricately interwoven tapestry
Of musical and ethical epiphanies
The interest is minimal
I'm on my own mission to mess with an angel
to take it all the way to where the sun is
Just like a runner loving running
Around to turn it into a simple symphony
Simple sentiment adrenaline is coming back
I made it my own city, whys it gotta be a superstar
I'd rather be a galaxy
But how you see is so dependent on the medicine the rhetoric
And how at any second you think you could sit on the brink of this
World is all asleep and I have no apologies
I breathe
Keep my rhymes on what we ride on
Let bygones be bygones
The migraines don't sidetrack
My final destination nothing rivals predetermination
To exterminate the germination
Of a nation that accepts anything that's thrown in their fat face
Cause when there's nothing left
There's no more point to the rat race
We don't waste a minute of the day
Hope you can figure what I'm saying
Trying to send it all way to another stage
A creative alternator rated and greater
The crazy maniabilities take it all up in your face wait
Success ain't only based on self esteem
It takes a sense to differentiate between
what's yours and someone else's dreams
I felt the screams climbing up my cold spine
Saying now's the time to put in all the energy
To get rid of the enemy.. I said its so..

We're here to

Sick of the same old thing

Free us and touch what we can't see

Lost inside its way too deep

Help me breathe

Eyedea & Abilities,"What a beautiful world, so fragile and fertile
Pain feel the void, when boy met girl
He's a puppet to nature, one year later now
So deeply and sickly in love, it makes him hate her
The average romanticized American relationship, sinks capsize
When either side becomes a slave to it
Conditioned, dependent, afraid to be alone
He needs that feeling that he can't create, (alone?)his own(home?)
He despises the fact she has a life outside of them
It drives him crazy to think she's not insanely consumed with him
Give her the guilt trip
And maybe she'll quit livin' to stay behind these prison walls
And lose all individualism
Well this is happiness, masochistic torture, plagued by the decadent, craved for affection
The needle digs deep to push contentment through his blood stream, it drowned now hollow
The pothole of a junkie
If he could only hear her sing he wouldn't want to break her wings
But emptiness has such a warm subtle sting
She makes up for what he lacks - trapped
He can't imagine life without someone like that

[Chorus]
If we'd discover the long lost art dying
Only the lonely resent angels for flying
Twisted, living off each other's sickness, like parasites
This is paradise
If we'd discover the long lost art dying
Only the lonely resent angels for flying
Addicted, afraid to take control of my own life
This is paradise

What a beautiful world, emotionally destroyed
(Her?) became girl(?), when girl met boy
Between several breakups and plenty relapses
Routine read comfort led to serious attachment
Now every once in a while she forgets to breathe
Terrified of losing 'em, paradise is misery
Too much faith in the lifesaving knight in shining armor
Now what knight's noticing - the scar she can't hide any longer
But they were her story way before he was
It's grows hope to think that he would feel such deep cuts
At first it felt so right but after one too many fights
He turned out that hallway light and all the wonder turned to spite
So they sleep in the same bed with guns to each other's heads
Dead the romance, boiling the blood that painted roses red
Suffering from post-honeymoon's disease, leeched to his whole existence
To die if he decides to live (?)
Addicted to the way she feels when they spend time together
Detouring the now in a childish attempt to find forever
Despite the fact they hold each other heart to heart
You can't be that close to somebody without being so far afar

[Chorus]

Sigh, this is the most obscure sound I've ever heard
Those lonely giant spaces in between your every word
And maybe I'm totally crazy for holdin' on
But just cause I'm insane don't mean that I'm wrong
Now that shit gone I can't sleep at night, I barely even function right
My memories on overdrive, too hungry and too cold to cry
Miss the companionship I once took for granted
The way you helped me manage, the partnership that vanished
But I don't expect you to stay chained by the ankle
There's so much world to see, so, fly free my angel
I'm dying without you but it's teaching me to live
Heaven ain't something someone else can give it's all inside of me

[Chorus]

There's so much world to see, what's stopping me from flying free?

Do you remember all the days when you still knew my face
Oh God, what I'd give to, to go back to that place
Here we stand separated

Can't go back to the places
I'm looking back just like a ghost
How did you slip away so far, so fast
Can I break this hourglass? Can I break this?

I've got a sickness that I can't seem to shake
And I know that you hold the cure
One choice remains

Every grain is another day
Every day becomes another waste
Maybe I'll never find my way

Do you remember all the days when you still knew my face
Oh God, what I'd give to, to go back to that place
Here we stand separated

Can I break this hourglass? Can I break this?

Give me more time

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

I'll let you know when she's come home.
