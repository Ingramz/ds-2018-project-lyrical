Texas Dixon,"Why won't you come home, 
Tell me that you love me
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Why won't you please 
Tell me baby
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I tried my best, 
To show you that I love you
But you were untrue
I don't know why 
You lied, but
You lied to me
Why won't you come home, 
Squeeze me baby
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Why won't you squeeze me 
With all your might
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I tried my best, 
To show you that I love you
But you were untrue
I don't know why 
You lied, but
You lied to me",Tonight,2009
Texas Eastside Kings,"Far across the blue waters
Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
",Fraulein,2003
Texas Hard Hitters,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

DJ Screw
A mufucka wonder what I'll do
Kill you bitch, pop-pop a lot
Youth or ancient, what's the deal?
Southside it's a new era, knoimsayin?
Put you on your boy's mind, real shit
Know what I'm talkin about?

[DJ Screw - Verse 1]
Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on a ledge, feel like I'm fallin off the edge
It ain't no fable, it's re-ali-ty
Feel like I'll move an your fizzin
they're tryin to tackle me, that's why I keep up the business
So relative or stranger, better keep yo' distance
I can't determine friend from foe so you in danger
Chemical inbalances of the weed and cocaine
But it really don't matter to society
A nigga that got no face an no name
Deservin more, but I'ma move until I ain't got nothin left
An the only thing that's promised to me is more povert and death
'cause there's some niggaz lookin for me an they might be near
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, Remember I'm a heavy here
Even still, gotta keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend don't understand
Don't want her to witness the wicked
so please find yourself another man... haters feel me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
This..is..my..liiiife
Forgotten in the struggllle
Livin to shine

[Verse 1 - screwed and chopped]

[DJ Screw - Verse 2]
Opposition and proposition is schemin for cash
And if you bitches is scandilous, I get mad at ya
So I alleviate the pressure, don't try to run
I guarantee the slugs'll catch ya (hahahaha)
Oh yea, I keep some problem solvers
I'll pistol-whip my automatic and revolver, check it
An I'm a, ""hello bab-ay"", it's in my nature
This a must it ain't a maybe p.k.
The feds takin pictures and tappin my phones
But if I catch you bitches snitchin best believe me it's on
I analyze an visualize to open fire on bitches
And if I catch you bastards asleep I'm leavin bodies in ditches (huh?)
I'll bet they ask a bastard: ""feel like spendin a long one in a casket?""
check it
Niggaz bustin your ass, all I'll give you's a ski mask
Bustin shots from my Rolles, tryin to make your car crash (feel me)
... This is MY LIFE

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - screwed and chopped]

[DJ Screw - Verse 3]
Everybody think I love keepin impulsive pride tappin
But I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rappin
See I know they want to get rich off of me, understand
Even if I was to die I would still rep talk, they'd still put a mic in my hand
Quit tryin to cover my style of life, pretendin like they from my block
But I survive from willin to live while they depend on war and talk
Before you make your move, check yourself and give 'er in front of me
Even if lyrical strugglin, adjust your ticket 'cause you know how dead your gonna be
There's gon' be a dentist to see
When a nigga be screamin and hollarin ""I'm yo' Godfather""
But I guess it's just the menace in me
Plus, the only nigga that's keepin me from clickin is Herman Fisher
We don't care 'cause to kid us he'll get us a drink and infinite burnin swishers
Why they want to play with my life? they got families, nigga I don't
The only thing between me an them hoes is I'ma keep thuggin they timid ass home
But they mind they own goddamn business, and keep theyself outta mine
Because of a thin line between livin they business and boo-yah!
Caught with the nine baby

Texas in July,"You are a dreamer,
Placing the stars,
Between your fingers,
Never give in to those,
Who think dreaming should stop.

Barricade our minds from the enemy.

Don't ever tell me what to do again,
Understand that this is my choice,
And you need to just shut up.

I hope you fail and you watch your,
Dreams fall apart,
I would give anything to see you crumble, shut up.

Stay out of my way,
Before I make you,
Experience the things that have driven me to,
This breathing nightmare.

We will never find our way,
In this cold place,
Unless we cast away,
Our history and leave them all behind,
With the rest of all the people that,
Made you believe,
That you wouldn't succeed,
They're wrong, make it happen,
This song is for all the dreamers who believe,
That they control their destiny.

Listen to me,
As my voice compels you to see,
That this is how it's going to be.

I can see that we will always disagree,
You go your way and I'll go mine.",Dreamer,2011
Texas in July,"I remember that day,
When I tried to patch your pain with faith,
And you betrayed me and our family,
Was it easy for you to walk away?

Full speed ahead with no turn back,
I watched the days turn your soul to black.

I never knew what your love was,
I can't accept it to this day,
Your life is driving me insane,
And I can't even begin to explain,
This situation to anyone,
Because I've lost my mind.

Lost my mind.

Mad, walking like the dead,
You walked away and paid no respect,
To those who love you.

Now you did it,
And it's over now,
No longer to be controlled,
You made your choice,
Now I'm through,
And I hope and pray that sense will find you.

I'm sorry, sorry.

I'm sorry that this is how it has to be in the end,
I simply have nothing left to give,
You've drained me,
For the worst,
I'm the one that always put you first,
I am alone,
You let me drown.

I can't forgive you,
But my memory of you will always stay,
As a loving person, who threw it all away.

I'm sorry that this is how it has to be in the end,
I simply have nothing left to give,
You've drained me,
For the worst,
I'm the one that always put you first,
I am alone,
You let me drown,
Let me down.",Magnolia,2011
Texas in July,"Burn the midnight oil
I’ll be awake tonight
Connecting dots,
Finding the way out

Paranoia, it comes in circles
And is headed right for you
Headed right for you!
I’ll be up tonight
I’ll be up tonight

I was so close to you
But now I’m as far away as I can’t get
Paranoia!
It comes in circles
And is headed right for you

So close your eyes and get lost with me!
So close your eyes and get lost with me!
To another space in time
Where you can’t lose track
To another space in time
Where you won’t look back

There’s no gravity to hold me together
What we are
How we feel
Why we felt it
Things in the air won’t change
To another place, another date
As we watch time cut away

Looking back now I would have done this all the same
Would have done this all the same
All the same, same
No state of mind control is far from sight
It has us running blind
Paranoia!
Is headed right for you

So close your eyes and get lost with me!
So close your eyes and get lost with me!
To another space in time
Where you can’t lose track
To another space in time
Where you won’t look back

There’s no gravity to hold me together

This thorn thrown in my side
For the last time
I see the start and won’t fear the finish line
For me this isn’t it
I won’t quit, I’ll beat the sickness
You think I’m crazy but I’m doing just fine
Living inside of my own mind",Paranoia,2012
Texas in July,"Endless in his trek and through these waves of traveled times
He welcomes the mountains that he has climbed
Determined, pushing onward with knuckles hes callused
His mission becomes clear in a moment of balance

Years spent approaching darkness, consciously spiraling
Smothered with radiance, yet only the darkest was comforting

Ascending above the decay, a beacon will illuminate the way

Day and night, I see the dimming light
That once ignited the spark that was in your eyes
I hope it finds you well, I hope it finds you well
We can sit, or we can stand tall
When the chance of growth seems so small
I hope it finds you well, I hope it finds you well

Ambitiously sailing a sinking ship, struggling to catch a breath
Let it go or stay confined as it plummets to the depths
Keep your mind at ease, wherever it may roam
Because even with a tattered sail, a strong wind can take you home

Illuminate the way

Day and night, I see the dimming light
That once ignited the spark that was your eyes
I hope it finds you well, I hope it finds you well
We can sit, or we can stand tall
When a chance of growth seems so small
I hope it finds you well, I hope it finds you well",Illuminate,2014
Texas Lightning,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to blue bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on blue bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou

Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

me encontre muy buen trabajo y tambien con el demonio.

Found me a little Tejanita and I fell in love with her.
She was so bonita and I had to marry her.
Then she took off to Laredo, and she called me from Nuevo León,
She said: Send me some more money, so I can come back home.

Ya me voy para mi tierra, aunque pobre es mi nación,
pero si, les aseguro, que alla manda el pantalón.
Ahí les dejo a mi Tejana, no la pude soportar,
hay que la toree el diablo, a ver, si el la puede aguantar.

Now I'm back in my homeland, back where I was born.
One thing I know for sure now, many wear the Pantalóns.
Left her in old San Antonio, 'cause I could not afford her.

And all the Christmas songs were sung
Padres knew what she would grow up to be

Where's your boots and where's your gun

In a pancake house down near the Rio Grande 
Well the waitress said, ""I don't know you from diddley
To me you look like one more tired old man""

Well he walked all alone down on Main street 
Was a hot wind blowin' up from the south 
There were two eye's starin' in a pawnshop window 
A whiskey bottle lifted to his mouth

There was no moon shinin' on the Rio Grande 
A truck of migrants pulled through town 
The jukebox was busted at the bus depot 
When Haley's comet hit the ground

Well he blacked out all the windows in his bedroom 
He was talkin' to the ceiling and the walls 
Then he closed his eyes and hit the stage in 1955 
And the screams of the women filled the hall

And he orders up two coffees to go 
He tells the waitress, ""Baby, we just found the body
Of someone who was famous long ago.""

Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)

You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls
So tempt me to jet set away in London
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ooh (La la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, ""You don't need that boy""
So let's run away, let's run away (way, way)
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

I remember, when the pilot closed the door
Said it's time for lift off, you said, ""What'd you choose me for?""
Don't ever wonder
'Cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top you'll never question why you left
My world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away
Let's run away
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is

Teyana Taylor,"10 a.m. it's west side bitch
She see the glasses, so obvious
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless? SMH,
We all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs, her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me
Here is where her heart

I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave' hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me

And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life",Sin City,2012

Teyana Taylor,"I got something to say, no
You gon' listen today, no

Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well I'ma talk about it
Baby, can we talk about it? Hey, oh no
(Yup, we most certainly can)
Can we talk about it? No, no

Yeah, first thing they say is stop killing
But can we talk about the cop killings?

They acting like blacks ain't got feelings
Knowledge of self is through wisdom
So can we talk about the school system?
Young girls raped and knocked up
Will Hillary release niggas that Bill locked up?
Can we talk about the cost of living?
We can talk about guns, but we forced to get 'em
It's a new race every time you cross the ribbon
Might've skipped the beat, but we never lost the rhythm
You don't understand so you ain't able to feel it
When my momma's in pain, I ain't able to heal it
Fatigues and field boots, the outer wear

Can we talk about it? (We gotta speak up)
Can we talk about it? (They say it's justice)
Can we talk about it? (I feel like it's just us)

Look, I know y'all tired of talkin' and going to demonstrations
But if we don't speak up, you help the discrimination
We need a one-on-one before it's goes gun on gun
People skip the front page 'til they see they son on one
And now it's too late to talk, the topic has changed
They shootin' at black targets like these cops at a range
Can we talk how many died for the birth of a nation?
And how this national anthem ain't worth my ovation?
And if I am standin' up, I'ma stand up for equality
It's brutality, we need more than that apology
Can we talk about it, not just artists, but the players too
Y'all on the field, not the mic, but y'all can say it too
We need more Kaepernick and just what the rapper kickin'
We need more than Instagram posts with smart captions
Black actors, stop actin' and start action

Step straight to it, not try to walk around it? (nah)
How we make America great again? (how?)
If we open up the doors and let haters in
Wow, it's nothin', we winners
But that could all change, since Trump won, we finished
Much realer than we thought
I'm sayin' all I really wanna know is can we talk

She wanted kick it all day, but we playin' soccer
I hit her, she hit me right back
My nigga she know what I'm on
I'll let her play with the money

Where was you when my homie came up missing?
Where was you when I was out here on the clock?

Bought to fuck up a check, and then I’m off for a week

Tha Alkaholiks,"I stop by the club, 'cause it ain't shit else to do it 
I'm on the guest list, it's E-Swift plus two 
Stepped to the bar, 'cause, it's a bad habit 
Open mic night, so, the Liks gots to grab it 
Check the mic, it sounds tight so 
I guess we might rock the motherfucker all night yo 
The niggas went wild, the hoes went crazy 
We dropped the microphone than we Swayze 

Ooh don't I sound great when I down a black eighth 
My style is much hotter than the enchilada plate 
My name is James but the girls call me God when I'm humpin'
I should get a gold medal for broad jumpin' 
Rappers, talkin' bout, back to the old school 
You never shoulda left in the first place fool 
Now everybody wants to be a prophet 
But I won't quit rhymin' bout my dick so get off it 
You put a rhyme together but I only dismantle it 
So gimme a high-five cause you juts can't handle it 
If rap was a swimming pool I'd climb to the top 
Plus a triple-back, hand me the mic and watch the belly flop 
Dagnabit, I got a bad habit 
It don't matter where I'm at I seen a booty and I grab it 
So niggas step back before you get lit 
I'm a grown motherfuckin' man and you can't tell me shit 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit

I rock you like Lenny Kravitz, or Nirvana 
I'm puttin' suckers on pause like a comma 
I never ape crazy act but I got the yapes a superhero 
From the ghetto puttin' creases in my capes 
(Up up up and away, J-Ro!!) 
I got more hoes than a canyon got echoes 
I'm rougher than Bluto, tougher than a callous 
My number one football team is Dallas 
Cowboys, now boys, can't you see I'm greater than 
Your grandpops is my number one fan 
You get ran on the court you dribble like Manute Bol 
You try to take it to the hole *crowd roars* get that shit outta here 
I'm more gifted than Christmas morning 
I pull out a pen and write a rhyme when I'm boning 
Me I'm tripping, let me light my Phillie blunt 
Oh there goes my beeper, what the hell do Billy want 
(Yo whassup J?] Man I quit selling weed

Well I got what you need

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit

You hittin' corners with the Alkies seen you pull-out 'cause you great 
The crew who got another tape that's bumpin' harder, save it! 
Rhythm and blues blew a fuse, and now it ain't the same 
They put a lot of Funky Drummers out the game 
They samplin' the fresh hip-hop breaks, just to make a hit 
That's why to me, R&B, really ain't shit 
So peace to all the real hip-hop niggyroles 
The ones who knows about flows and rockin' shows 
I want to say whats up to the ladies 
I gotsta say whats up to the ladies 
From the Atlantic, to the Pacific 
I gotsta be specific, they know I'm terrific 
I'm pushin' up to the bars, got em screamin' Alkahols 
Oh gosh call me Josh cause I'm bringin' down the walls 
MC extraordinaire, J-Ro came to set it straight 
I never hesitate to grab the mic and meditate 
In LA, most niggas walk the same 
Act the same, talk the same, drive the same 
Dress the same, shoot the same, fuck the same 
But this is Ro and I got my own game 
I drive through lyrics like I'm riding on the freeway 
And I don't give rappers, no kind of leeway 
Chumps be hittin' ejects cause I break necks when I flex 
I be housin' mo niggas than the projects 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit

J-ro man I'll hop over this motherfucker and get my own damn drink

Hey niggy, what time it is 

It's time to roll my sleeves, fuck a few mc's up
Another rough cut, from the crew that won't ease up
The alkaholik click, aka the forty downers
Flips rhymes like calvin flips fries and quarter pounders
I never drink and drive 'cause I might spill my drink
I failed the breathalyzer so they took me to the clink
Niggas earlin' in the sink 'cause they can't fade the cisco
I'm from the old school but I never rocked a disco
Loops from the group that, likes to smack the bitches
Tha liks is hittin' hookers like a gangsta hittin' switches
Front, to the back, to the side, to the side
And make you dance with these bitches but, no electric slidin'
And I'm about to flip, but first I'm bout to sip
Off the forty ounce of brew that I was savin' for the trip
Back to the lab 'cause all I do is bang cuts
That's why I hang around my group like a dick hang with nuts

I push one two's when niggas step on my shoes
Oh you haven't heard the news I've been giving fools blues
Manhandling chumps that step up, just to keep my rep up
I push my fist through your grill
I never became a gangsta, thanks ta, my skill
On the nine inches of steel
You ask me what the k's for, they don't mean nothin'

Float like the wind, so all y'all can call me cool breeze
Cooler than my man morris day in the winter
The dope rhyme inventor, rockin shows at the center
So pass the mic on the, down low
Now go grab a forty from the liquor sto'
And you don't stop {don't stop and you don't quit {don't quit

Yeah that nigga squid is in the house

I got a forty-four mag with the clip (with a clip)
So mc's watch your lip, 'cause I'm shootin' from the hip ahh
I rip like oprah, in tight jeans do
And splits a needle wrap a pair man because them shits is on the fritz
It's crazy, a few mc's amaze me
With this alkie style of rock, Mr. spock couldn't phase me
Rhymin' pays me, but I do it anyway
Many say, ay, when it comes to rhymes you got plenty j
I'm so cool I drink forty ounces of freon
You never see me on the stage with a peon
When we on the microphone it's like Jordan all alone
We slam, competition, scram damn
Can we get along? nope.
Switchblade to the throat to mc's who ain't dope
Call me j-ro the clepto, 'cause I'm stealing to the jaw
Of these half-baked rappers, trying to get raw

Soul in my strut, muscle in my hustle
It's just a little something for them punks that wanna bust they little
Def jam comedy, raps that make me crack up
You better call the one-time and tell 'em send a backup
'cause I'm about to act up, I couldn't kick a verse
J-ro say he got it bad, so that mean I got it worse
Check uno dos, crack a forty, make a toast

The freshest, yes it's, the rhymer with the bottle

Gots to roll deep like ants at a picnic 
Get with the crew that's flowin' like likwit 

Every night I pray to god please, no more whack MC's 
I catch a few z's, wake up and bust these 
I get over like a high jumper, freaks be on my wienie 
'Cause they know I'm packin' more shit than Bandini 
The freshest on the map servin' raps with all fixin's

Run of the mill skills got your neck in the noose 
But hey, I be the K-I-N-G Tee for short 
Big ballin' nigga playin' rhymes like a sport 
Wicked when I kick it, yeah that's the ticket 
Tossin' up a forty still buzzin' off the likwit 

You ain't got enough skill, to fill up a cup 
So niggy won't you just shut the (hold up)
The girls call me dookie man 'cause I'm the shit can't you smell son

I'm a togger not a fogger step on hunts and don't do stunts
I got soul power never took a cold shower
Never had a girlfriend the color of cooking flour
You can call me sleazy 'cause my rhymes are kinda greasy
Some brothers wear curls, 'cause it ain't easy being peasy
Like a kung-fu flick, I stick you in the dick, with my toothpick
Tell 'em rick (you hit them harder than a fuckin' brick)
I like clothes and hoes but like 'em better in the sheets
I rock more beats than Jesse Owens ran track meets
Amazing feets move, they happen everyday
When the ro to the j bring his ass out to play
I weight one-eighty but I'm, fat
I ki-uh-kick up dust when I bust like a cap

It's all about the liks 'cause we're heavy on the kicks
But we're easy on the treble (adjust my mic level)
So fools can here me mic checkin' all the way in china
The skills you can't front on, tha alkaholik rhymer
Could rip a show up to' up so I always flex my talents
But my words don't be slurrin', I never lose my balance
But that's 'cause I'm slick tossin bottles like a discus
The liks could rock a party from Halloween to christmas
That's why I'm screamin' on mc's like I'm onyx
I'm hooked on gin and tonics like your momma's hooked on phonics
So when we steppin' through, with the thirty-two of brew
Niggas better make way for the alkaholik crew

After you get those, come the hoes and the sex
Girl you keep askin bout the niggas in my crew
Yeah I'm down with pooh, but what's up with me and you
Cause I don't give a fuck whose your cousin who could fuck
Cause I just wanna fuck, damn I wanna fuck
So unlock the gate and make room for the heavyweight rapper
The slim light skinned coochie slapper
Pull over to the side so I can roll up the indo
Got the bitch head bumpin' on the front window
Wham, bam, I spanked you ma'am
I wonder how they make these rubbers from the skin of a lamb
I blow into the mic when I check it
Had hoes gettin' naked way before I made a record
I smoked a gang of liquor, I drink a gang of boom

Early in the morning, you gave me a buzz 
I picked up the phone and didn't know who the fuck it was 
I feel like Johnny Gill I want to wrap your body tight 
Lick you from head to toe and watch you glow like a Lite Brite 
I met you at the park around three 
When I got there you was loungin in the car with my homey 
He said he needed a dub so I slipped him one 
And said ""c'mon Mary Jane and let's have a little fun"" 
I got you in the sack, I got you in the sack

Mary Mary, why you got me buggin? 
Look what the homies done drug in... (Mary Jane) 
Prettier than any model 
I met her at a house party sippin on a bottle 
Her dress has got a nice fit I'm locked like a vise grip 
She's the type I'd like to spend the rest of my life with 
I would if I could but I know I can't support her 
Can't take her on vacation, wouldn't make it past the border 
When she ain't around I get the feeling that I need her 
Mary Jane be acting white but I ain't caught the jungle fever 
But she be so thin that I could slip her in my pocket 
I lick her then I knock it till I'm higher than a rocket 
Whenever she's in the same room with my friends 
They all trip because she's dope and she don't want me for my ends 
So just to make em jealous when she walks up to me 
I reach out and grab her by the booty, Mary Jane 
Mary Jane Mary Jane 
Mary Jane Mary Jane 

My eyes are red, but not from cryin 
Whenever Mary Jane runs out, I sit there sighin 
Sayin to myself, 
""When oh when will Mary Jane come back 
Where oh where can I find Mary at..."" 

(""Wear your hat"")
I jump into my Benz and start my search all through the hood 
'Cause all the spots she used to hang in ain't up to no good 
But needless to say, I kept lookin and I found her 
Right on the corner of Central and Allandra 
I picked her up quick and in a hurry 
And then all of a sudden the undercover swooped in flurries 
I said, ""Hold up! Don't shoot. I know this looks like a kidnap; 
But all I want to do is get my Mary Jane back."" 
They took me to the station, giving me some sation 
And some jib about leaving Mary Jane at the crib 
They let me go but they kept her, because they had a bounty 
On her 'cause she's wanted from here to Humboldt County

The party ain't over till that fat bitch holler
I'm in the house so check the way I flow
Niggas say I'm fat, everyday I say I know

Tha Alkaholiks,"The year is 2004, people talk about war
I had to hit the floor when the bombs began too pour
Ten minutes ago I was mad cause my stomach was grumbling
Now the whole world is crumbling
I hear people scream across the street gettin' crushed
This went on for twenty minutes then the whole world hushed
I couldn't see shit but I could feel myself breathin'
Damn I'm still kickin' but I'm just not believin'
I give thanks to God then I'm off on my mission
Ain't no stars in the sky so it ain't no wishin'
I wonder, I wonder, I just can't under-stand
Why, am I the last man?

These crazy thoughts in my head won't stop
Where's my moms and my pops and what about hip-hop
I'm pickin' up things that could be of use to me
Too build a makeshift crib where Hollywood used to be
And it ain't no forties, it ain't no blunts
I ain't had no ass in five years and eight months
Five more years pass, and I still survive
And I'm through with wonderin' who's still alive
Until one day I'm just walkin' along
And I hear this kid singin' a hip-hop song
He said, ""That's the way it is, and it's like that""
I said, ""Yo kid c'mere, where you learn that song at?""
He said, ""My daddy taught me about the hip-hop game
I'm eight years old and Rakim is my name""
He said, ""Yo I'll take you to him, come follow me;
but first you gotta prove that you can MC""
So I cleared my throat got in a b-boy stance
and I ran through a rhyme that made him piss in his pants
With tears in his eyes, he grabbed me by the hand
And then we ran, ten miles across the sand
He took me to the spot, dig deep underground
Where I can hear the sound of the big bass pound
I wasn't really sure, but I swore we smelled blunt smoke
No joke loc, well can I get a toke?
He took me to his pops and he handed me a spliff
And out behind the wall came Tash and E-Swift
They took me to a freestyle session it was on
I knew hip-hop would never be gone
Five hundred hip-hop deep
Yo we cool in 2014, Alkaholiks still rulin'

It's gonna live forever

Hello
Let me tell ya about the liks
See it say it 
Ah, yo

I walked into a store I stepped straight to the freezer
I grabbed some forty ounces and a few Bacardi breezers
I threw 'em on the counter then I went to find some chips
I'm thinkin' bout this bitch I'm bout to visit with the hips
I asked the counter person for the biggest box of Trojans
Cause when I be on the pussy I 'cause nuclear explosions
He put them in my bad, totaled up my sums
He said, ""that comes to thirteen dollars,"" but I didn't have no ones
I gave him twenty, in walked some shorties
Eyes beemin' red headed straight for the forties
Five foot three wannabe tupac's
They asked the man behind the counter for the Newport boxes
They stole some cans 'cause the man couldn't see 'em
Cause he busy tryin' to tell 'em next time he'll I'd 'em
One was starin' at me, then suddenly it hit him
That's that nigga from the liks let's crack the forties with him
They gave me daps they said I freak my raps
They said they homey got some flows and twist off the beer caps
Halfway finished, I asked 'em what their ages
Cause they lookin' like, they barely out the puberty stages
Fifteen, sixteen, one was too embarrassed
He said they started drinkin' fuckin' around and went to terrace
It wasn't long before the forties was gone
So as I turned around I told my young niggas to stay strong
Because no matter how you scan it you're the future of the planet
You don't wanna be a rapper 'cause it's drainin' entertainin'
Too much strainin' on your brain, I told 'em they don't need it
They hit me with a card and said, ""call us if you wanna gt
Weeded,"" yeah sixteen years old
Hangin out drinkin' forties in the east columbus cold
As they jumped onto they bikes in the knee-high snow
They all turned around and said, ""you ain't shit rico!""

Can I send this out once, for my niggas smokin' blunts
Twice, for my niggas rollin' dice
Three times, for my niggas bust the rhymes
So they don't do crimes to make it through the hard times

As we send it out once, for my niggas smokin blunts
Twice, for my niggas rollin dice
When the liks is in the house we let you know like yo!
If you hit me with a forty black I hit you with a flow

It was a Friday night, house party goin' on
At my homies house, from dusk til dawn
Blunts in the air plus kegs of brew
Some half naked-bitches gettin' pushed in the pool
(In the corner was the dj, gettin' nice
Feelin that shit, off the alehze and ice)
I only had one mic, now imagin
A gang of drunk mc's who wanna start rappin
One grabbed the mic and held on too long
("" baby I'm on the mic, and I'm on the mic
When I'm on the mic (pass the mic God damn nigga)
Doin what I like, and when I'm on the mic "")
Push came to shove bang now he's gone
That's what happens when the liquor does your thinkin'
So keep this in mind when you're out there drinkin

Can I send this out once, for my niggas smokin' blunts
Twice, for my niggas rollin' dice
Three times, for my niggas bust the rhymes
So they don't do crimes to make it through the hard times

As we send it out once, for my niggas smokin blunts
Twice, for my niggas rollin dice
When the liks is in the house we let you know like yo!
If you hit me with a forty black I hit you with a flow

And I'm out, time to get busy
As we flow up out this piece
I ain't even mad, I ain't even mad
I ain't even mad at y'all
It's the alkaholiks 

Yo yo, mic check one two one two
Transmittin' live through the headphones, you know how we do it
Low budget style
For all mc's in the houe I know how you feel
I know you feelin' the vibe right about now
Crackin' the forty, sittin' in the car, or at the club
Bobbin your head to this album
But yo, we gonna give you, we gonna give you a second to catch wreck
Go ahead, get your freestyle on
And you don't have to be twenty-one
Rock that shit",21 and Under,1995
Tha Alkaholiks,"Caps get peeled rolling in my force field
Like a nine with hollow points I keep rap flows that's ill
So when you walkin' down the block
You better watch who you approachin'
I'm not your R & B singer, so ain't no need for vocal coachin'
Just a forty and a roach and I'll admit you rock the units
While y'all niggas couldn't move me if you worked for starvin' students
Downin' all beer types, from St. Ide's to Red Stripe
(Yipes)

The menace stuffin' mics down motherfuckers windpipes
Has returned to burn, it's time y'all niggas learn
I naturalize y'all niggas like relaxer in a perm
With flows that go against the grain with a story so compellin'
I should mind the people's court
Snatch the mic from Doug Llewellyn and host my own show
After Bill Cosby comes Rico
Transmitting live to all my black people
Catch my drift, I'm down with my nigga E-Swift

My name is Tash, I'm from the group that you don't wanna fuck with
Never shy, sippin' on some why ask why
Smokin' Thai with this bitch that's more fly than Jasmin Guy
Hooked up with John Q so let me do my thing
While niggas rock the play shit that they bought from Chess King
But still, I train rhymes to flip like a seal
Niggas say my rhyme skill on the steel is unreal
But all I do is chill and swing it when I bring it
Oh shit, that's my nigga, show these niggas how you figure

I bring it to your chest, pour all the way live
And deliver ill verse guaranteed to 'cause highs
When we start rappin', heads roll like Patton
With the flood blood clot the Alkaholiks rhyme a lot
Yo, I'm like Grimace when I'm on this rap scrimmage
And I got this magic, want to make your puny soul diminish
The abstract delivers, I be the Queens nigga on point
Mary Jane ain't nothin' but a joint

They called a nigga up to add a little bit of flavor
Now I'm cuttin' and slashin' like Luke's light saber
Yeah, what? You trapped in the zone
Where MC's get seared and all spots blown
And in this rap shit a nigga need to be thicky
I fuck with the crew who downs the deuce, deuce Mickey's
I'm from the rotten apple, y'all niggas can't grapple
And love to the Liks, hit your ass like a tackle

Pow, bust my liquid-ass style
Peace to Mad Lib and my nigga Wild Child

Yo, put in the disc E while I hit the whiskey
(Bust a rhyme off the head J)
The nigga missed me, I'm in this rap game so I'ma aim to be best
It's fresh, but off the head it's like the dunk contest
I don't walk the street, I roll my Jeep in an instant
I rock the beat to sleep like an infant
The Likwit crew, comin' like this on you
With that four minute Olde English piss on you

You're bustin' dumb raps off the cap, oh shit
But I got the pen and pad locked down like a pit
I let the, ink submerger, into the thin wood sheets
Beats make my head bop, so I'ma rock it for the streets
I fill all my days with big butts and boom
I let my pants hand 'cause my big nuts need room
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm modern school, I'm ditchin'
When my girl starts bitchin' I gets got like a kitchen

I fly down like the Chi-town wind
'cause I got the iller noise to make the hardcore grin
When, the saints come marchin' in
I'ma roll right by 'em in the fly Lincoln
Roughneck niggas wanna box me down
'cause I got the ladies lookin' like Foxy Brown
The Liks bring the beer Tip sticks it in your ear holes
I drop the mic and strike the Heisman pose

Hardcore G, I get hardcore man
From the underland a fuckin' wonderman, bam
Lunatic potential, an isperential differential
Confidentially smashin' instrumentals
On this tune I bring raps of doom to the mic
And put my rear shit in flight, peep
If the drunk funk don't wanna hump in your trunk
Man, you got some motherfuckin' junk",All the Way Live,1995
Tha Alkaholiks,"Yes yes yes yes yes yeah-he-ha-ha-ha! 
Back to drown y'all motherfuckaz! 
Who we got, we got, we got 
We got the Liks, we got the Liks, we got the Liks 
Cause MC's in ninety-five, MC's in ninety-five 
MC's in ninety-five that think they rock like 
MC's in ninety-five, MC's in ninety-five 
MC's in ninety-five that swear they rock live 

MC's in ninety-five they need way more rehearsin'
They write they booty kyrics then they add they little curse in 
You're not a true hip-hop person 
Spend a little time with your rhymes and quit makin' wack versions 
I send this shit out to all them niggas from that group 
With the ninety minute demo sounding just like Snoop 
You better bizzay, your ass up out my rhyme zone 
Fore I leave you on the ground broke up like pine cones 
You're rootin' and tootin' but ain't did no shootin' 
While the freshest hip-hop, it curses verses like a wicked witch 
Disaster, cock the rhyme flows back to kill 
To get me out your system takes more than Golden Seal 
'Cause I bust so many flows I gotta file my shit in columns 
While MC's be goin down like Olympiads that slalom, rock-bottom 
I got em, left without no watchers 
While I be housin niggaz like they put up for adoption 
I rock loaded, I never get promoted 
But through the bullshit my crew stays devoted 
While you be bustin' lyrics bout the funs y'all niggas toted 
I'll be standin like a B-boy with both arms folded 
But no exucses, I still get the loosest 
When RIco's in the house tryin to grab the mic and juice this 
So back the fuck up like we told you last time 
Cause it's the Liks in the house with the ninety-five rhymes 

[Chorus: x4] 
We can do out thing (we can do our thing), bottoms up! 

I wake up, kill a roach, call the homies, hit some weights 
Reminesce about the shows we did in forty-eight states 
Banned in the rest, but we was on tour with who 
De La, and Quest, we made the crowd say yes (yes) 
Now it's like fuck, Make Room, move your ass out my way 
Bay-bee, bay-bee 
With all these hoes around clwon, why you want to bang? 
Let's have a celebration like cool and the Gang 
I bring it all the way back, like a punk return 
I rock some spots and call more shots than Chick Hearns 
The only MC I like is Amante 
I was drinkin Asi Spumante wit cha auntie 
Bust them lyrics shots from the AKG 
When it comes to style and finesse, I'm the epitome 
Hit a beat, make em all retire, flyer 
Higher than a jet, like Stet I'm on fire 
'Causin pain like a runaway train you don't stop 
Drop the track, now watch it flow back to the top 
I'm the J-are-O, not J-E-are-you 
And you know what we came to do, bottoms up! 

[Chorus: x4] 

When you hear screams, that means King Tee walked in 
The advertisement, and that nigga's bent 
Raise up off the wall, bitches Last Call 
Ready for the ruckus, pushin' motherfuckers off the stage 
Teela's got a brand new gauge 
So Make Room, for the crew with beats that 
I got a complex I guess I bust best with stress 
A mess, don't bring that shit to the West, cause 
Uh, I bring drama, like Jeffery Dahmer 
Choppin' up MC's with they mama 
Ah-hah! Oops I made a funny with the dozens 
The one-est, who busts rough rhymes for the cousins 
Super Nigga's comin! Faster than a bullet 
Leapin' over buildings, wavin' at the children 
And don't even trip cause the Alkaholiks funk don't cease 
Tash I'm up out this piece

Bustin' out the perpetrators I see through 'em like a Zima. 
So I'm never caught between a hard place and a rock, 
'Cause I kill rhyme bandits bare handed like Mr. Spock. 

I told chief not to start no beef, 
He tried to shoot me with his gun I caught the bullet with my teeth. 
'Cause I'm stronger than the bull that's on the Schlitz Malt Liquor, 
Hittin up your cities with the Alkaholik sticker. 

'Cause I feel like bustin' loose, 
It's the wicked pain inflicter with the Mickey's deuce deuce. 
Droppin rhymes like a boulder on the twenty-one and older, 
That's what your momma with my picture tattoos on her shoulder.

I've been told that my style is so cold it make your nose run and j, 
I make the ladies say, ""Make money money!"". 
I used to have a curl but I cut my shit real low, 
'Cause every weekend I had a spin on the pillow. 

Watts, Willabrooke, even shook, when I took, 
A fresh-ass hook out my notebook. 
Dan-na-dah, dan-na-dah, I love sports, 
I even watch soccer and the girls on the tennis courts. 

You try to tackle me, you couldn't make me fall, 
'Cause I been movin ahead since the day I learned to crawl. 
Y'all, aw shit, let me make a wish,

That's how I floss yo pass the hot sauce.

In the concrete, 'cause I'm fat meaning, I'm so complete.

Tha Alkaholiks,"The Baby Bubbas in the house
We came here to party, so get up everybody 
We came here to party, so get up everybody 
We came here to party, so get up everybody 
We came here to party, so get up everybody 

Well my name is J-Ro I came to rock the world
And my name is Lil Tone I got all the girls
In the place to be is Devastating E
And Exhibit on the mic so viciously

The Baby Bubbas in the house 
The Baby Bubbas in the house

I say sticks and stones may break my bones
But this gat sure nuff will kill ya
And if you're messin' with Tone then you will see
On the street is where I'll leave ya
I say I don't play games when I play that thang
You make a move get up and to the boogie the bang
Cause I'm a, Superfly on the microphone
And you can tell by now I got it goin' on

See I wear my Adidas shoes real real tight
Just so I can do my windmills right
I'm fresh out the box, baby can you dig it
Funky def rhyme comin' straight from Exhibit
See we came here, to rock the world
I broke out the sheen and refreshed my curl
See I hip, hop, never will I stop
Protect and serve you like Robocop

Well my name is E in the place to be
I like to drink cold old, forties
Drink until my stomach is numb
And talk about tall big ever-rum
Rappin' on the mic like he's the man
With this break I'm Superman
Lookin' like Kurtis Blow's song
Singin' dum-diddy-dum-diddy-diddy-dum-dum

Well I'm the king of romance, don't stop to rock
Girl I can't dance, but I can pop-lock
I wanna freak freak, I'm so unique
Get your panties wet every time I speak
Well you spell my name with a J-R-O
I'm a hip-hop professional
Sippin' rum and coke straight out my cup
Yo E-Swift won't you cut it on up?

Ayy DJ, aiyyy DJ
Yo what's the name of this song, man, what's the name of this song?
Flashback, always coming right and exact
Flashback, and you know we could never be wack
Flashback, Baby Bubbas comin right at you
Flashback, Lil Tone, what cha gonna do

Well I was walkin' down the street it was sunny and hot
I saw my sexy girl drinkin' on a soda pop
I said, ""Uh baby doll, you got it goin' on
You make me feel warm like butter on popcorn
A sexy chocolate, you're sweet like a cookie
Why don't you play rookie, so we can go boogie?""
A hoochie coochie, a inny minny monny
My rhymes stay shinin' like gold on a diamond
Some can chill let me tell my grin
Cause I was there the first day when pimpin' began
Because Uffy told Duffy, and Duffy told me
Then I told it to the Mack then they make the movie

Well I was standin' on the corner talkin' to myself
I said self, you rhyme like no one else
Well you the rapper man's rapper, dressed fresh and dapper
Everybody knows you do the funky hand clapper
Remember that party down on eighty-fifth
You best believe man you was shootin' the gift
So I bought myself a forty and some candy too
Slapped myself out and started doin' the do

Thanksgiving I went to mom's house
Cookin' that pork and I seen the mouse
Shit wasn't right, I lost my appetite
She made me stick my black ass there all night
I was stuck, she didn't give a fuck
I found that I was shit out of luck
And my stomach had a big-ass loll
So I drunk some Pepto-Bismol
To the hip to the hop you just don't stop
On the microphone is where I rock
Sucker MC's talkin' all that stuff
Party people let me hear you say rah

See I rap real strong, remove you like a tumor
You're nothin' but cum on the sole of my Puma
You know I'm def, ladies say I'm fresh
See I rock the crowd til there's no one left
I'm slick like oil, I'm rollin' in my caddy
I make the females scream, ""Hey Cad Daddy!
What's up with you? The Baby Bubba crew?""
We kick it on Electric Avenue
So all the girls know I'm colder than the freezer
Exhibit in the house party people I'ma Libra

My name is Lil Tone and I'm good to go
And my zodiac sign baby is a Leo

My name is Devestate rock from dawn to dust
My zodiac sign is Aquarius

G-G-Gemini is my zodiac sign
I rock the house party at the drop of a dime

Baby Bubba's on the mic, E-Swift's on the cut
So get up out your seat and shake your butt
The Baby Bubba's (repeat 3X)

Yes, everybody put your headphones on
Sit down sit down yes calm down
The question was, what is an Alkaholik?
A Alkaholik is this
Some people take their first drink of alcohol
They like it, or they don't
They come back tot, or they stay away
You listen to hip-hop for the first time, you like it or you don't
You either come back or you stay way
You come back to Tha Alkaholiks, liquid flows, every time baby
So get it right, get it right motherfucker!
The Liks is in the house for ninety-five, keepin' it live
Yes yes, all the hip-hoppers say yes yes
And remember this, you cannot escape the power of the T's
And on that note, we gonna take it to another level
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha excuse me",Flashback,1995
Tha Alkaholiks,"I pull up to front with a smash to the ground black duly
Niggaz in the street gettin' wild and unruly
Digga B was in the front so he let me through the door
I never get frisked so I pack a forty-four
Straight to the bar, can I get a rum and coke?
The whole club was filled with the indo smoke
E-Swift was scratchin', Tash was hoe catchin'
I had the latest fashion but my shit wasn't matchin'
So King Tee was baggin', the nigga Threat was braggin'
Bout his brand new, baby boo, fiendin' with the rag in
Lorenzo's, but anyway, them hoes was deep
Peep, E-Swift shoe em how we creep

Check you out, yeah you baby, up against the wall
Here's a dollar ten rum and coke, heavy on the alcohol
Starin' at your chest, and I can only guess
Lord have mercy what's up under that Adidas dress
Yo shortay, you're lookin' kinda nice
Stick around and watch us rock the mic device
She gave me this look like she was puzzled or troubled
I don't think I'm large so she didn't bust my bubble
It's the Liks baby where your girlfriends at
She said they got thrown out tryin' to sneak in the back
No sweat, I'll go out and get em
Hooked it up for Noid and Tash to get with em
Now we on stage stop the mic from back-feedin'
Got the three hoes in the front row chillin'
That's how it be when you play high post
Cause all I wanna do is tap that ass and get ghost

This is how I roll it, I met her at a club last week
It was this fly ass freak, I didn't sleep, I got the digits, laid back
Coolin' at the crib one day
I think I'll call her, we're talkin' on thephone for half an hour
I finally ask her can a nigga come through
She talkin' bout she ain't dressed I said ""Cool, I'm still comin' over""
I get there, she's chillin' in some undies and a robe
Ice cold, forty down in the freezer
And roll up blunts at my leisure, I play like I believe her
How she tellin' me she ain't no skeezer
An hour later I was breakin' her off
In each and every position that you can ever put a bitch in
I got up and then I washed my shit
Alright bitch, word got her rings then I split
Yeah back to the shade, so I can get my lounge in effect
Xzibit keep the hoes in check, so check

[Chorus: x2]
All I really wanna do
Is tap that ass 'fore the night is through
All I really wanna do
Is tap that ass and get ghost with the cash

I was drunk as hell-est, I begin to bill for my pray
The club reminded me of whylin' at the Bush back in the day
That's when I seen her, the freak from the diner
Her name was Nina, or Tina, or was it Regina
Fuck it, the bitch with the tipple bitties and the boomin bass
I said my name is big game all in her face
I said for what it's worth, I'm the best on earth
Kickin folls off my turf since the day of my birth
I got a pocket full of money do you wanna help me spend it
Can I get in your backfield like Cornelius Bennet
She said, ""Mmm, J-Ro yeah!
Just let me know the time and I'll be there""
I said, ""I'm drunk, tired, hoe, for heaven's sake
Let's go to Larry Parker's for a burger and a shake""
We got to the place I started stuffin' my face
Not a bid did I waste, cause it was good to the taste
I didn't wanna get stuck so I said, ""What the heck
I left my money in the truck so won't you pick up the check""
And the next move, you might think it's tasteless
But I gave her a tip and got ghost with the waitress

We rip shows, and hoes drop clothes backstage it's funny
The shit bitches do for money
Only jockin on a nigga with his name in lights
I'd rather kickback relax and play the shades real tight
Yo last time, caught it with this fresh-ass hooker
Kept runnin' her mouth about what it last meant to her
I said, ""Look hon, all I gots is blunts, forties
A couple of brothers cause I don't know the kids before me
You're trippin."" Dip into the streets to chill
Nigga these days, I'm gettin PJ's, on the freeways
It's lovely, I get home, blaze up another drink
Of somethin' kinda stronger, to make the funk last longer
Yo, it's the one and only who welp the bitches
Thinkin' they got me but yo they gettin' they-self
I'm a bomb like the stealth, and hit way up above your wealth
You felt the vibe when I tapped that ass

[Chorus]",Hit and Run,1995
Tha Alkaholiks,"That's the alkaholiks functions, conjunction junction
The remix version for all the brothers out there
That got shit on they chest and just wanna let it out

Anything you could do I could do fresher
When I'm on the microphone I rock the shit without no pressure
Cause I snuck my forty ouncer past the bouncer with the stun gun
I gots to get some lyrics off my chest so let me run one
Cause who's bad? not Michael Jackson when I asked him
I even rock the mic for seven days with Toni Braxton
It's the, liks, rockin' like a six point six
So while I be scoopin' bitches you rush the porno flicks

For reals, I gots more skills than an occupation center
I got your hoe cookin' my dinner
Action, lights and cameras ain't needed
Indeed it's, the nigga that be gettin' rappers heated
I'm j-ro, and my style is darker than a mole
My rhyme is so hot you got to stop drop and roll
All the liks releases, become masterpieces
Oh jeezus, my style is sick like pork greases

[Chorus]
And I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)
They'll say I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)

They'll say I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta let it all out (I gotta let it all out)
They'll say I can't hold it in (I can't hold it in)
I gotta, I gotta let it all out

I get in 'em when I sin 'em, the alkaholik venom
I fold your clothes with your body still in 'em
The rhymes I got, hit like Ronnie Lott
The only way you take my spot is with a shot
I grab rappers by the hand and make sure they understand
That they can't scrape j-ro the man
A nigga who stays, in the old school ways
And just like subways, I can make your days
We got more soul than james brown and platform adidas
The likwit crew, comin' new like a fetus
So run tell your granny, your pops and your girl
niggas like me gonna rule the world
So all aboard the j-ro train to funkytown
Express from the west so it's best that I clown

I bust the alehze on ice on down to beck's brew
I got more fame than dana dane I hold mics like Donahue
Cause I'm committed, admit it, you was too legit to quit it
Dancin' with toilets now you can't get busy with it
With the vintage olde gold gettin' dusty in the cellar
I throw my shit deeper than Jeff Hostettler
So yo what you got, 'cause God damn it's hot
It's the alkaholik rhymer up in your night spot
So ease up off my line, and let me rhyme
I lose you like the jewelry that that bitch can't find
Call me e.t., but yo, it don't take a secret psychic
Cause even in the future i'ma frak it when I mic it

[Chorus]

With flows rough enough to cut ya, beats enough to touch ya
Known to rock the cooles with the liquid rhyme structures
It's the man with vocal tones that hurt words to broken bones
I got flows throughout my body deep rooted like kidney stones
So tap into the cold while I torch mc's
Cause I be itchin for a scratch like the force md's
But yo fuck that, tash is in the wind with the gin
I gotta pass the mic to j 'cause he can't hold it in

I can't hold it in my friend the liks get the most clout
We be scorin points like michael irvin on the post route
And just like joi boy, I make your bones ache man
Just how much punishment can a rapper take man? 
The homes be like where you been? man I been creatin
We had you salivation like the dogs that be waitin
For the kibbles 'n' bits, I love pits tits and rap hits
And Bruce Lee flicks, and clockin yapes with the liks

I can't hold it in I gotta speak my mind
There's a lotta half-ass niggas thinkin' they can rhyme
But their style is not buttah, it's more like busta without the a
You never think of nothin' fresh to say
The freshest dj from the state of ohio
I remember when you battled, cuttin up survival
Nots toe fucked with, used to brag and boast
Packed up my technics, now I'm on the west coast, now I

Yo before we get up out
I wanna shout it out to my nigga diamond d",Let It Out,1995
Tha Alkaholiks,"[Chorus]
Welcome to the next level
The L-I-K-S, what makes them motherfuckers so damn fresh

Youse a nigga everybody diss cause you can't bust this
You got a bad name like Dick Butkis
Welcome to the next level, of rhyme flowin'
Scratchin', hookin' up beats, and hoe catchin'
Everytime I come home, I got fifty messages
I only call back the girls with big big breasteses
Ooh, I got bitties, in all the major cities
The safest way to have sex is right between her (tittes)
I beeped this fillie from Philly, we was puffin on a Phillie
She started actin' silly, so I popped her like a Willie
I'm like Cucamonga, I'm way out
And you know I got the flow that'll never play out
I was raised in Cali just like a palm tree
I rock the mic from London to the Mohabi
Tash Diamond D and the Ro to the J
Amazing feats happen when we come out to play

[Chorus]

Out the funk bag of tricks
Just for kicks, I represent with the Liks
So here's the Vicks, I'm hittin' harder than a brick
Tricks get slick, and face the dick real quick
You better recognize, adjust your bifocals
Your style is local, I sit on beats in Acapulco
I put words together like Peter Jennings
And skate on motherfuckers like Peggy Flemming
So woah to those who owe
From one oh four five six to nine oh two one oh
I'm sippin' on pina colada
Two blocks off La Cienega, at the Ramada
But hold up, I'm not done yet
I get hard like the perm pimps wear on Sunset

For all my niggaz in the places with blunts in they faces
Off the two turntables with the anvil cases

(Gots to roll deep) in these crazy-ass days
Bu the Alkaholik rhymer, King Tee and Diamond D
Got the gats pointed at ya like we're to round three
Cause nineteen ninety-four is the year we overdo it
With the house party beats and flowin' like fluid
Cause ain't nothin' too but to do that shit and print it
But it's all about the loot so every move is documented
And vented, by the man born for lyric kickin'
Coolin' out with your bitch eatin' sweet and sour chicken

Exceeding Visa limits if the tab's on you
I get drunk and reminisce about the shit I used to do
We used ta, take out crews as a hobby after two in the lobby
Me, Mike D, and my beatbox Robby
Sendin kids back to the lab for more practice
The only way they'd win, if we battled to see who's the wackest
Ten years later, still a hip-hop slave
A prehistoric b-boy makin' beats in my cave
The L-I-K-S, what makes them motherfuckers so damn fresh
It's the, liquid flows that we spillin' on ya

I'm back again to test your reflexes

If you don't believe Swift then you can call Steve Griff
If you don't believe Griff then step up to fuck with I
Call you up and send you as a gift to hieroglyph

I slam like a fifth that stays hidden

Tha Alkaholiks,"Ayo, they came down, you know 
I know y'all get asses all the time 
But do me this favor 
I want y'all to bust the freestyles for us 
I want to know who's first up, you freestyle? 

Yo yo, we got Crackerjack from the Loot Pack 
About to see this shit off, a Crackerjack 
Set it off. I know we on the radio, yo Crackerjack 
Set it off 

Ya dumb dunce it goes once upon the rhyme, Jack is out 
To clench a fist and drop flows that gets papes like The Abyss 
All in this, freestyle's wild when I'm throwing this 
Non-bogus brothers shake the hip and toe and just 
Get involved, roll with the souled, make the head nod 
Look at the bash slash back I kick the abstract 
Make brothers say ""Damn, that rap's fat,"" recline that ass back 
A smack-back and slap from Wild Child with the ram shack 
I used to pick up the damn slack bed on the ramps back 
In the days, when Eric, was in the, honey phase 
Nowadays, turn in applications 
Rocking the Appalachians with the ladies with the sexy activations 
On the Black watch, I own a black watch, although I'm Black watch 
You want to, confront who? A microphone check one two 
Complicated for ya (yeah) 
I got the naps that break the picks 
Plus the props from the Licks 
Ha ha, Loot Pack's on the rise 
Saying, ""Licks licks licks boy, run your backside"" 
Yo, J-Rocc, Mad Lib, my man 
Just, get on the mic and please arise the jam 

I bust the animated suspension, vocabulary wack MC prevention 
My division is itching for the switch 
Pitching upon the West coast, the best brad and boast 
Braggadocios, ferocious emotional osmosis 
I skip like a stone when I lake over a break 
I rip microphones and I take over the fake crews 
I wish I could sing like Smokey do 
But I'm vocally locin' with the Loot Pack crew 
I'm Mad Lib, the bad kid, brothers try to do what I did 
Back in junior high, 'cause I'm fly with my 
Vocabulary tradition, total chaos rhythmatic 
Static, in fact they case erase so stay off 
Cause nobody knows how it goes with the flows 
And rows of hoes froze, chosen bust erosion on the lows when 
The ill speak, plus the licks knot thick 
Mad quick to rock ya lip, like hip-hop to grits 
But yo freak this, I come with uniqueness 
I'm like Pepe LePew yo, hoes are my weakness 
Back in high school you didn't think I could get nifty 
Now I'm on your magazine rack down at Thrifty 
Since eighty-three I been housing folks 
All the way from Orange Country out to Thousand Oaks 
It ain't another rapper in the country who can crunch me 
If you don't believe me, run up and try to punch me 
I flip the funk like Monk, Higgins when I'm digging 
I'm swigging on a Snapple 'cause my crew be wicked when we gig it 
I rock the mad vocab, when my toe jabs I'm so bad 
I make you flow bad, like when I blow lads to pieces 

No releases on the two steel wheels 
Comes the lyrical skills that kills more ducks than oils spills 
My niggas run for the hills, I can track 'em through the mountains 
Rico kick that kind of shit that got more bounce than Roger Troutman 
So pass the weed to the top top seed 
With lyrics as deadly as the VD's that make ya lungs bleed 
Plus I dig like coal miners through the crates of old timers 
I be blowing up the spot like dynamite with one-liners 
Oh remind, are to my ex-bitch when I find ya 
I'm a smack you for them times I had to start sixty-nine 
Yes on the low, my nigga with the hat to the back 
Get on the mic and show these niggas where you at 

Here I am doing shows, wall to wall 
Nate stacks tall I still won't fall 
Never will I be sellout poverty, some don't believe in me 
Still I get my verbs on, my verse on, I raps long 
You're dead wrong, all in all should say the sale starts 
When AandR says go, you start with the dope verse 
And you're sold, now you're on clearance when the record starts selling 
But I'm not willing, to be uncovered from the depths of the under 
I'm under, for the duration 
The past present future revelation 
I gain the trunks of those who comprehend 
Because the know I send niggas through the other end 
Of this industry, commercial side envies me 
Females are freaking me, no time for 'em 
At least not yet, just a few that I will call bitch 
I'm not a player, strict rhyme sayer, say your prayers 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
Don't sleep, I'm on the creep 
To invade the holes of the ill-minded 
I find it's fat, rewind it back slack, not here boy 
Wack to the skull-crack when I attack 
Unleashing crazy chaos you're way off, so stay off 
I'm about to blast off 

Word is bond! On this snoop babe, that's how we do it

Where we at again? 
Ah it don't matter, we rock it for the whole world anyway 

Yo we gotta give a shout out, a shout out

Individuals, close they eyes, cause I blurred they visuals 
And I'm about to be as large as Houdini in a minute

Yeah check out my Ro-gram 
Since I was a kid I got darker 
I write rhymes so phat I need a marker 
My style gets bit like Peter Parker 
If imitation is the greatest form of flattery
Punk don't flatter me 
I slam you like a pogue on my dog with no fleas and ticks 
Chicks love them light-skinned rap niggaz called the Liks 
Youse a wizard, with no tricks, the J-are-O got the spells 
You never even heard Rock the Bells 
My cash flows, like a bloody nose 
It stains all your clothes, and your pill-ows 
I come from the home of the Rodney King beatin' 
Pacoma CA, Riff Rack is where I'm eatin 
Your style is like do do doo out of service 
The Liks walk in the jam the punk MC's be gettin' nervous 
I never take falls, I got more balls than pre-hauls 
I flow without flaws to scrape all you sucka paws 
Never ever find the fool that stole my brew 
(I'ma do mean, terrible, nasty things to you) 
Don't lose me, I make a rude bwoy say excuse me 
If you choose the real shit you can't refuse me 
Ask your grandpap I bust the dandy rap 
I be posted in the bar like Andy Capp 
And I, could, just, go, all, the, way 
On Friday 

Yo whassup baby!!! 
Yo wasn't that your nigga there performin'? 
Nah nah that wasn't him

I jump out the bushes and ambush your crew 
Push you and moosh you like a bitch, what you want to do 
It's round two nigga I'm showin' no love 
It's like a heavyweight match, but without the gloves 
You just can't rock a show, you're too quick to fatigue 
I think you ain't busy since Red was in seas 
You need to put a little more thought into your writin'
Your style is Virginia Slim, while mine is Phillie tightened 
So stop biting what your mouth can't chew 
A nova eat you but my DJ flow better than you 
But when I go to set it call the closest paramedic 
Cause you faker than that motherfuckin' jewelry that's cosmetic 
So hold on to your seats while I rock these beats 
'Cause these are just the repeats of our amazing feats 
'Cause even Kurtis Blow knows we break beats like world records

Tha Alkaholiks,"Verse One: Tash 

I knew this nigga by the name of Captain Hook 

Who had a record deal but no lyrics in his book 

But everywhere you looked he had a poster for his single 

The one he bit the oldie track and stole the oldie jingle 

jangle, but I be comin from a different angle 

Cause I want that pot of gold below the hardcore rainbow 

But name your price and you'd be down to sell your moms 

I'm on a different level while the Devil grease your palms 

Sign your life away in ink, cause you think you got the talents 

But look at Hook's bank account and zero is the balance 

I repeat, ze-ro, peo-ple 

Cause he be worried bout his hook so he could get a spin from [------] 

[-----] but Rico, blow them type niggaz through the rooftop 

Cause [------] only plays you if you R&B or Tupac 

So one single later, he fallin out the game 

But before that nigga left, he left us his name 

Chorus: Tash 

Captain Hook, Captain, Captain, Captain Hook 

""spend a little time witcha rhymes"" 

(repeat 2X) 

Drink drink, we drunk, we drunk, drunk 

Drink drink we drunk, we drunk drunk 

(repeat 2X) 

Verse Two: Tash 

And for your info, I can set it off to any tempo 

And have you niggaz puzzled while I make it look so simple 

Cause deep inside my mental I got stacks of lyrics hidden 

That's why I get the props that Captain Hooks don't be gettin 

Plus they be counterfeitin, styles straight scandals 

Spendin too much time tryin to party off the handle 

I bust to Orlando, tryin to better what I got (why) 

Cause I'm Tash the likwifyer here to take somebody's spot 

But not that nigga named Captain Hooks 

Cause he's the type of rapper, that's always worried bout his looks 

But overnight success don't impress the West that's freshest 

He need to take his cheese and invest in rappin lessons 

Or catch one for free right here on me 

Or catch me late Friday night on 92.3 

And after lesson three, if his style still stank 

I'ma tie his ass up and make him walk the plank 

Chorus 

Verse Three: J-Ro 

I was in my Likwid cruise ship, just sailin the seas 

When Captain Hook came and stole my steez 

Oh Hook, caught a left hook, for stealin my hook 

In no time he stole a rhyme out my notebook 

I'm the the Pacific Ocean, floatin 

Chasin his broken ass out to Oakland 

But WhoRidas said he came and stole they name 

And he got E-40's briefcase full of game 

So I, set myself back on the Ro's quest 

With the Farrahey brew up in the crow's nest 

He could see L.A., there was trouble you see 

Oh shit, he just stole a flow from WC 

Now he's throwin up the dub I gotta catch the fuckin scrub 

He'll go down like a sub cause I'ma cut him like a shrub 

He wants pub, yeah, he's all on Blass 

He moved real fast on Snoop and Ras Kass 

Chorus (J-Ro instead of Tash in the first half) 

Verse Four: J-Ro 

Now I'm Atlanta, and his trail is hotter than a sausage 

I'm too late, he took OutKast out to hockey 

I wonder could he squab with the Goodie MoB 

I think he got the best of me, just how many would he rob 

I floated out to Queens but it seems I just missed him 

They said he robbed Cool J for his boomin system 

He went to Shaolin and stole Method Man's bio 

and he buried everything somewhere in Ohio 

Bone Thugs saw him, at the Crossroad 

with a empty treasure chest that he was tryin to load 

He was last seen sailin, into the distance 

We gotta catch this crook and we need your assistance 

Yeah, if you happen to see this punk scallywag out there 

Don't try to aprehend him, just call Tha Liks 

And if you suddenly got some rhymes missin, you know who did it 

Captain Hook, yeah we gon catch his ass 

Baten down the motherfuckin hatches 

We gonna feed his ass to the gators 

But first we gonna

Tha Alkaholiks,"Intro: Tash 

Yo... who we got? Check it out, aiyyo 

Aiyyo, givin the women somethin they can feel, who we got? 

We got, we got, we got, we got, we got Tha Liks 

""If y'all niggaz can't feel me, then y'all niggaz ain't real"" 

Ahh-haha, I see the whole Likwid crew is up in this motherfucker 

Posted gettin toasted 

I know them niggaz don't dig this shit with these women out here 

But yo check it out we can't make every song hardcore (can you feel 

this) 

But we definitely ain't gonna make no soft shit 

""If y'all niggaz can't feel me, then y'all niggaz ain't real"" 

So feel the real 

Verse One: Tash 

Feel the realness of the brother that leaves the women wide 

With rough words of pleasure that they boyfriend can't provide 

Cause while they niggaz think they slick, fuckin down low tricks 

I got the finest hoes in Cali fightin over this dick 

But I'ma single nigga lust, so nobody gets hurt-ed 

No one is alerted cause they heard that I flirt-ed 

Unlike these niggaz that you claimin is your only 

that be in the wind at night while you watchin TV lonely 

But phony shit is what relationships bring 

That's why you lookin at my fingers but you see no rings 

Just a fist full of digits and a forty ounce of Miller 

Cause the last girl I had that bitch made me want to kill her 

On that shit, tryin to sniff my clothes 

Swearin up and down I was out coolin with hoes 

But yo Rico knows, what it means to be committed 

And when I claim you as my ""beyatch"" I go all the way with it 

And that's the real 

And that's the real (tell me can you feel this) 

""If y'all niggaz can't feel me, then y'all niggaz ain't real"" 

So all the ladies in the place can know, that's the real (can you feel 

this) 

Uh, that's the real (ah one two) 

""If y'all niggaz can't feel me, then y'all niggaz ain't real"" 

Verse Two: J-Ro 

I thought she was the one for me, only for my eyes to see 

Sometimes I let her cry but she's a lady 

But most of the time I kept that bitch happy 

Kept her toenails painted and her hair from gettin nappy 

It was a rainy cold weathery winter 

I met this broad at the Beverly Center 

I stepped to the hottie with the body, nuttin to it 

I said 'I like the Nike's baby, can we Just Do It? 

What would it cost to be J-Ro apostrophe S, yes yes damn you blessed 

with fat ass with no ripples, tools big like ?hipple? 

It's Tha Liks six baby baby on them nipples' 

She just smiled and said 'Ooh you need to quit it' 

(Damn bro, all we want to know is did you get it) What? 

Shit, I hit it, from all the angles 

Swingin my thing like the California Angels 

Things got serious as much time was spent 

I said 'Fuck it, let's split the rent on this apartment' 

Two years together quickly turned into four 

The tears began to pour when I had to go on tour 

Two months later, I walk back through the door 

The bitch is butt naked with some nigga on my floor 

DAMN, I didn't know I had a hot one 

Went to my room and grabbed my shotgun (ahh chill) 

I coulda, shoulda, but if I woulda 

I wouldn't be here today 

She tried to make me think everything could be the same 

But she ran too much game on my 5""11' frame 

I coulda, shoulda, but if I woulda 

You know the consequences 

I coulda, shoulda, but if I woulda (just chill nigga) 

That's what I hate bitches (I know you feel this)

Yo, I'm from Killa Cali 

I wrote this rhyme in an alley 

The tall can MC stepping fresh out the valley 

I'm hella fresh comin straight through your chest 

I blow a hole in you soul, I'm constantly on a roll 

'cause in order to survive, you gots to have drive 

Like a rental, but I'ma call you Ben 'cause you gentle 

My crew's blowin up like a Pinto 

Hip hop's gettin rotten but we stay fresh like a Mento 

So put it in your mouth 

We gonna show you what this rap shit is really all about 

We gonna turn this bitch out like Goldie 

This cut will still bump when it's an oldie 

And if we still ain't sold platinum or gold 

That'll be the bigges lie you ever told me, hold me...back 

Black, I snack on the wack and wash it down with a fifth of Yak 

It's like that and that's the way it is 

You can ask his to stay out my biz 

Girl, I'm off the hook, plug me into your adaptor 

I'm sending wack rhymes to the rafters 

Turn up your skill factor, you bitin rhymes like a Raptor 

You thought we was through but this is still the first chapter 

Before I go, can I get an ""Ooh Ooh!"" 

It's J-Ro, baby, from the Likwit Crew 

Chorus: repeat 8X

King Tee: 

Now watch me run amuck 

And gun em up with the shit 

Rebel rhymin from Tha Liks 

Alkaholistics all true with no tricks 

The infrared pointed at they lips 

And man they don't speak, they keep the conversation petite 

They shit is weak, I'm concrete like the beat 

Bust that ass, super nigga jeep class 

Me last in the game, no problem 

Sit and drink a fifth with my nigga James Robinson 

Check your alcoholic pulse while its throbbing 

The Likwit Squad, the entourage 

Get exquisite, get addicted, get Xzibit 

Fellas want to test King Tipsy but its risky 

He probably slap a nigga in his mouth like a bitch. G

I be killin it (why Tash?) cause I be feelin it 
I get money so no need for stealin it 
I work diligent beneath the Earth's soil 

where I write rhymes so fresh it's like I wrapped my styles in foil 
But I sit at home and boil spicy rum when it's freezing 
Cause I from the Likwid crew where we got drinks for every season 
Maybe that's the reason why I live high all July 

And the place I buy my beer is callin in for more supply 
Maybe not, maybe so, maybe yes, maybe no 
Maybe niggaz got some friends that want to battle for some dough 
If you know somebody holla, cause I take those extra dollars 

Split that shit with J and Swift, buy a ninety-six Impala 
and lace it with the deez out my own stack of cheese 
Get a extra flossy floss and toss King Tee the keys 
and say, 'Nigga that's yours, cause you opened up doors 

Before Tha Liks had a deal, you had a nigga on tour 
So God bless ya, never let this rap pressure test ya 
You know who got your back when them other niggaz sweat ya' 
So check uno dos while I roast this coast a toast 

When it comes to beats and rhymes, you know who got the most 
I be killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)

Mida, mida, down the barrel of my heater 
I torch ya, then skeet out in my Porsche two-seater 
I'm from the home of rattlesnakes and golden bears 

And Astro-vans with swivel chairs hoes come in pairs 
Plus, makin money's in my genes 
That's why I got money in my jeans, I got a cravin 
My mind craves the knowledge, my pockets crave the cash 

My mouth craves the brew, and my Johnson craves the ass 
Who's on blast, Tha Liks baby, don't twist it 
Just rock it, got your girl's number in my change pocket 
What's her name Stella, if she's on me kinda hella 

?Voule vou couche vic moir? is what I tell her 
I get freaky like Friday, why dey, try to get loose 
Wack MC's are like ?brown guts?, they have no use 
I just got off the court, where I was whoopin some cats 
In basketball, here's a question that I have to ask y'all 

Who be killin it, is it the ladies? 
Who be killin it, is it the fellas? 
Who be killin it, is it the be	-boys? 
Who be killin it, is it the gangsters? 

Who be killin it, is it the rastas? 
Who be killin it, killin it, killin it, killin it... 

See I be killin it, yeah, when I be feelin it 
This is dedicated to the niggaz that be stealin shit 
Straight from the bottom of my black-ass heart 
The untamed feel no shame, on top of the game 

Mr. Big Bad Insane, black John McClane 
Look listen and learn, you only get what you earn 
So I'ma hustle like fuck regardless, watch my smoke 
Go straight for the throat, we known for rockin the boat 

It's hard to find like the grade A shit, with no cuts 
Tryin to stack like King Tut, and still bang the microphone up 
Demandin, clear lane for crash landin 
If anything I'm guaranteed to be the Last Man Standing 

Pick a number motherfucker whassup? 
The circumstance make you shit in your pants, and we advance 
As an avalanche of soul, and everything that shine ain't gold 
Just cause niggaz got brew don't make em nickel proof 

My record contract reads hit man for hire 
Xzibit showin grace under fire

I heard niggaz want to know who flips the most hoes 
The R&B singers or the niggaz with flows 
So what I did was take a poll, like Clinton versus Dole 
(So the fake rappers wouldn't be out of control) 
And the more girls I asked, the more I heard 'em say 
They said they wanted balls, pussy niggaz stay away 
Good choice, 'cause Rico don't be losing his voice and no...(activator 
spraying sound) 
To make my hair look moist 
Just a sack of pommel that I got from John Dale 
'cause this is how I do it but it ain't Montel 
It's the knight in rusty armor, hardcore rap designer 
That be dissin pussy niggaz in scoops of eyeliner 
'cause look at how you dress, you think you lookin fresh 
With your leather vest wrapped around your cutie bird chest 
Keep freezing while I keep easing down the road 
'cause Tash will scoop your girl no matter what y'all niggaz sold 
Gold or double plat 
Catastrophe will have your girl butt-naked laying flat (laying flat) 
Horizontal, while I'm running all up in it 
To the rap jams, you know, that 99 beats a minute 

Party shit 
The R&B singers try to swipe 
That's why they callin me to make they remixes hype

'cause these(smiling faces)smiling faces sometimes 
They want to backstab and bite my rhymes 
But I keep a pack skin tight 
You want to pen fight? 
Just give in, 'cause you know you'll never win, right? 
It ain't no sunshine in the midnight hour 
A 3-day shower couldn't wash away my soul power 
(Stop, Look, and Listen)That's the way of the world 
I turn cowboys to girls, lions to squirrels 
Is it just my imagination, or is my generation 
Fascinated by gun play and incarceration 
Peace to the departed, I get it started like A-be	 
see, It ain't nothin like the real thing baby 
I'm taking it to the streets, but the burbs is much cleaner 
(Searching for Mary Jane, man. Have you seen her?) 
Yeah. I found love on a two way street

James let's pass some of this brew out, check it out, yo 
One for you, one for you 
One for you, one for you 
A few for your crew, and this one's for you 
One for you, but this here is my brew

I throw my hands up and say, ""It's good"" like Gene Tunny 
Come here pull my finger, so I can let the funk flow 
E-Swift the funk bro, beats to make the trunk roll 

Welcome to the house the one-times can't raid 
Where I grab the mic trippin' like my weed was sprayed 
So to try to take what's mine you better be the smoothest criminality 
'Cause I'm deadly to the point I had to warn the Surgeon General 

So let the women know, they call Captain Slave-a-Hoe 
Or J to the Ro, from Tha Likwit crew beer roll 
And speakin' of crews, yo whose next to lose 
Instead of five mics, I'd rather have five brews 

And if y'all niggaz peeped the news you saw the weatherman predictin'
The rain was on the way because you know who brings Tha Likwit 
The nigga risked it, rap exquisite down for housing 
'Cause I'm tryin' to keep it pumpin' til the year two thousand 

And fourteen, we'll still be holdin' down the scene 
Comin' fresh every time like peas from Jolly Green 
Every time we rock a show we send the crowd to detoxes 
Tha Liks bring the flicks that kicks like six oxes 

And I be rockin' niggaz boxers like I'm DJ ""Run"" 
So men and women rush my music like it's CK One 
So of course I got it locked even my whackest two bitches 
Look flyer than the hyenas and the low-rider bitches 

And we left you all in stitches now we back like early morn 
We comin' back out on that shit like creamed corn 
With that Likwit funk, won't stop until you say uhh 
I save a brew for you, fool, only when I'm drunk 

So what you sayin' punk, even with a shipment of equipment 
You still couldn't rock it 'cause you don't be comin' different 
So that bruisin' you was cruisin' for has just arrived 
With the Olde English crack just to make it live 

One for you, one for you 
One for you, one for you 
A few for your crew, and this one's for you 
Damn we runnin' out of brew 
Now what we gonna do? 
Three drunk motherfuckers goin' round the outside 
Round the outside, round the outside 
Three drunk motherfuckers goin' round the outside 
(So dosey do your partner!) 
 
Can you feel it? Yeah
If you didn't have it would you steal it? Hell yeah
Well it's yours! 
My rap skills are black like burnt hills 
On the reals, I make the coldest nigga catch the chills 
Like the Buffalo Bills, you had your chances (that's right) 
Pack your pots and pans, and fly your ass back to Kansas 
I should Diss You, whack rhymes are the issue 
I come up with hooks that'll pull out your tissue 
Like Tito, white kids think I'm neato 
I chop emcees up and throw em in my burrito 
What? Never interrupt me when I'm speakin' 
Just sit your ass down and say, ""We all"" like a Deacon 
Fuck the trendy clothes I want the bankrolls 
Your style is funny like hoes with big butts and skinny ankles 
 
And havin' shoes or where their coats is, right under our noses 
'Cause Tash brings the chronic, so fuck a dozen roses 
Talk they feet out sweep em from the second that I peep em 
'Cause the women look so good I want to take em home and keep em 
Freak em, but only with my Jimmy well protected 
'Cause I know you want it raw but I can't give it to ya naked
So chill for a second while I wreck it on the Audi 
'Cause I kick that kinda shit that leaves y'all bitches brains cloudy 
Now we, come to the payoff because I'm way off 
I fuck parties up like Ferris Bueller on his Day Off 
So peep how I creep and how deep I dive 
With the Olde English crack just to make it live 

One for you, one for you 
One for you, one for you 
A few for your crew, and this one's for you

I used to roll with moms, shotgun in the Datsun 

Rest in peace shouts out to Donnie LaToya Watson 

A real mother for ya, the Ro will never bore ya 

I clock mail like Mel be spittin game like a lawyer 

I rolled it up, spark it, then I blow like 

Branford got one more Son than Sanford's tryin to send him to Stanford 

... and ohh yo like Quasimoto 

my name rings bells, it's time for Tha Likwit photo 

Yes... ladies and gentlemen... 

You are now rockin with the best 

Chorus: all 

Yes, you are now rockin, you are now rockin 

You are now rockin with the best 

(repeat 2X) 

Verse Two: Phil Da Agony 

You're now rockin with the best, maximum capacity 

for MC's that ain't for the Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull 

Pullin words like tug of war from my memory banks 

core secure, sweat pours through the forces I give em more 

Who want to see a Likwit MC 

without the glass ya laugh, feel the wrath of the blast 

of the liquor in the flask, so don't ask, or form the question 

Verbal harassment, to your environment 

Music element, to your conscious, the beat ready rocker 

Sippin the vodka straight smokin the sess that niggaz hate 

I got the the grammer for Panorama City, with bills in my socks 

so they won't break in my pocket on the block 

Fool I'm bout to go purchase me some Old Gold beer 

My niggaz gettin wasted on my stairs and under the stairs 

Liks can cock while I'm twistin my beers 

You gotta be able to twist at least three, to Phil Da Agony, really 

My currency stretch, for the stress 

while I book my matches, askin niggaz who want to match this 

Yes, you are now rockin, you are now rockin 

You are now rockin with the best 

Chorus 

Verse Three: Tash, E-Swift 

Niggaz think I'm off my rocker, but big Tash is lifted off that vodka 

So rappers know it's curtains from the second that I spot ya 

Cause the top notcher goes the extra length to bring it liver 

Get me drunk enough and Tash'll crash a party skydivin 

Cause to danger I'm no stranger, my mic has insurance 

But just to keep it safe I called E-40 for endurance 

So it's a everyday occurrence for the Alkie fam to slam 

the Likwid hits that make y'all niggaz say, ""Yes god damn!"" 

So get off your ass and JAYAM, to the sounds of Rum and Coke 

while I blow my smoke and show you how deep my Likwid soak 

into your brain, I still got the style they can't explain 

But my homey want to bust so tell these niggaz what's your name! 

I'm E-Swift, my beats are known to leave speakers blown 

In any fuckin zone, my style is prone to wet the microphone 

The hardcore music conductor, the Likwit MC slash 

beat constructor, rockin this motherfucker 

That's some stuff niggaz I'm finished, if lyrics 

need to be replenished I'm sendin bitin MC's to the dentist 

to get they grill fixed cause they got too addicted 

Now they feelin the pain that Tha Liks have inflicted 

I make clubs swing like Tiger Woods on the green 

I go the whole eighteen, avoiding anything in between 

Niggaz tune into these flows like Friday night mix shows 

on the radio, my crew is unfadeable 

Chorus",Rockin' With the Best,1997
Tha Alkaholiks,"[Featuring Loot Pack] 

Stop, listen, what's that sound 

Likwid motherfuckers came to tear the house down 

[Wild Child] 

Hey yo, last FreshFest we was rockin Good Times 

This LikwidFest I be bustin out rhymes 

When Loot Pack's on your set we'll take total control 

of your mind feet body and inner soul 

Multiple beats to subject to discussion 

Wild Child sets it off after DJ Rome bring in my cuts in 

Can't understand overnight MC's that can't afford 

to get broken with the mic whether it's with or without a cord 

So I grab hip-hop right before wack MC's infect it 

Come attackin to your forehead and slowly make you respect it 

and then inject it, into your system, and when your veins 

start pulsatin, showin you Loot Pack, rocks the nation 

I'm on the court, Wild Child rocks the fort 

Keanu Reeves and Sinbad givin support, that gets my love 

I'd appreciate it, if y'all appreciate it, then rock with us 

Real hip-hop's not hard to spot like shoplifters (I see you) 

I flip that rhythmic, technique no gimmick 

But when you see Loot Pack rock, watch us freak the physic, yo 

I must confess I'm from the West about Fresh 

Don't try and test cause I break MC's down to they flesh 

[Tash] 

So put your best against this, it don't matter who flows 

When they step in my direction Rico slows they rolls like 

AHH, cause my brain tells me go against the grain 

Cause these other niggaz out here all be rappin just the same 

But I spit flames, I kick ass and take names 

Fuck the boozy dames, this art should be placed in frames 

and hung up on the wall right next to Picasso 

I heard niggaz comin down the pike, not so hot so 

Tash comes blazin, Loot Pack blazin 

Hot enough to fry you into california raisins 

Cause my Alkie style of rhymin is ahead of it's time 

I make words connect lovely like Coronas and lime 

So where you rhymes at? Break em out, don't be scared, show me 

Everytime I flow I feel like y'all niggaz owe me 

The one and only from the group you could feel 

cause it's a million Alkaholiks on the Earth (and that's real) 

Chorus: 

Stop, listen, what's that sound 

Likwid motherfuckers came to tear the house down 

(Uh, I'm to' down, uh, I'm to' down, uh, I might skip this round) 

Stop... what's that sound 

Likwid motherfuckers came to tear the house down 

(I'm to' down, I'm to' down y'all, I'm to' down y'all, I'm to' down) 

[Loot Pack] 

We got that rhyme elevation racin like a mad liberation 

circle and run your base and, bust hip-hop 

preservation if you heard this on your station yo then you know 

that we'll knock you out with just, light ones 

Cut ya like a throne was on the cut slicer, I wet ya 

Yo I kick flavor, got more beats than my nigga got 

beeps on his pager, cause my flavor's like major 

Rhyme patterns intertwine with the beat offtime 

Then I read off lines or freestyle rhyme 

Make ya rewind the crate digga niggaz, always, spliff rhyme rip 

Never slip my hop hips a grip 

With the Likwidation lyrical radiation you're facin 

fate worse than freebasin, with them flows your chasin 

Lyrics lead the Pack way, so I can blast a 

rapper that ain't classy, get up out this fast lane 

Cause you'll be feelin mass pain from being phony 

like when a nigga swear he know me, yo it be no comprehende 

Been doin this long you might as well call me a sensei 

[J-Ro] 

Round and round I go 

This rapper's name is J-Ro 

Wack MC's don't waste your timeeeee 

(let me stick to the rhyme) 

Niggaz talk about scrappin when they can't scrape a grape 

That's why I choose to stick to myself like a roll of tape 

You don't want to battle dog, I got a catalog 

of rhymes, break it down to your enzymes 

But your ass talk trash, know when your style is garb-why 

You soft as a Barbie, hard as Terence Trent D'Arby 

You the wackest MC I ever heard 

You fly like a wingless bird, it's absurd, you get the 

D-I, see-K, in-ya-mouth, all-day 

for comin outside anyway, my style's terrific many say 

You lightweight like ashes, it's goin down like plane crashes 

at all Alkaholik bashes 

Chorus 

[Tash] 

Yeah that's right West coast this the tear down 

Likwid crew in the place, knowhatI'msayin? 

Yo fuck that let me shout it out to all the homeboys coast II coast

Big up to the whole Likwid crew, big up to Mobb Deep

Cross me or cause me, fuck jiggy and flossy 
I'm tryin to keep the government off me 
Dodgin hard time and house arrest 

Whatta you expect, findin' what ya never forget 
'Cause you're sellin wolf tickets that your ass can't pay 
What I display, skill last found in Cassius Clay 
In this prime time, hustle for mine 

Used to nickel and dime 
Doin felony crime, but now I bust mine 
Instead of bustin' at enemies when the sun go down 
Me and my niggas with a fat one 

Smoke 'em all down to nothing 
Crushin rappers, bare Witness like Jehovah 
Swore we haven't been sober 
Since 21 and over 

[Chorus]
 
King Tee do your thing 

When the Likwit hits my soul 
I get conceptions to make the microphones explode 
The drunk mode, sippin X-O from the straw 
King Tee broadcaster raw 

Optical intoxication, flood your video station 
Scramblin any playahation 
But some of these fools got tricks in they boxes 
So I blocks it, pull they whole set out the socket 

Tha Alkaholiks rock shit 
Any which way man I got shit 
The Alkaholik don, king from Babylon 
With some fatal shock shit 

In this district, I'm listed as the mystic majestic, I gets hectic 
What you expect, shit 
The Likwit comity 
Believe me loc, things will get shitty 

Ain't goin' look pretty 
Commin' from the likwidation squad 
Smoke weed, drink hard, my god

We got the boom-boom claats, shakey like Don Knots 
They bitin like a room full of pits and rots 

I got that old school soul 
Called take it back like repo 
And I got foes on my shelf like homes T-Paul 
I'm see-Bo, that's my homeboy Rico 

Posted up with three French bras at the need bowl 
I got dressed wit the speed of a cheetah, finished up my two liter 
Hopped in my 2-seater

Got 'em on the fifth floor 
Knocked at the door

""What the fuck is goin' on in here, What's happenin', 
Where we drinkin' at, These my homegirls right here, 
What y'all drinkin' right now, fuck that, All we got 
is Hennessy"" 
 
We O-W in the whole zone

Let it rain brother (2x) 
Let it rain 
Rico do your thing 

And up next, we got the Likwitest 
It's so drunk, it's ridiculous 
When Tash got the mic, 
I swing my shit like Jack Nicklaus 

I'm spinnin' this with niggas that slept on Likwidation 
'Cause no matter where you go, 
They know the reputation 
CaTashtrofy I punk lyrics with spunk

That get that 'bumstick' krunk 
So if you watch your ship sunkin 
Fuck you with the drunken

You are now breakin your necks wit true underground vets

All that other bullshit can move it to the sideline
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have for you
Mr. catashtraphe from the likwit crew

A lot of rappers fuck it up, catashtraphe'll fuck it down
I'm so hungry for the mic like we just gettin off the ground
But my style is at a national
Three albums in, you ask your friends about catash
They'll say ""tash can injure ninja""
The gunner, I walkin in ask about the spread
Bet against the likwit crew's the best way to lose your wig
'cause I'm above y'all niggaz heads, below y'all niggaz knees
My style'll get you drunk till you can't say your ""abc's""
I get my write on, nick at night wit my light on
'cause goin plat-I-num is what my homies got they sight on
'cause I been mega-tight on microphones since I was tethen
I may not look like I'm the deepest, but looks is deceivin
'cause I be takin mines into deep space nine
Wit a sip of brew for me and two sips for mankind
'cause tash got the style wit more soul than solid quartz
I got that big game, you might hear my name on ea sports

Don't regret it  you had your chance and couldn't set it 
You hear me rhyme and try to shine on my time  forget it 
Hear me on radio  live vocally do edits 
E Swift scratchin and threading  with supreme unleaded 
Only the best out the Likwit Crew out the west 
And we shine time after time writting lyri-gets 
On freshly buffed and waxed marble steps 
Defari got a stlye that's iller than Tourrettes 
Make you switch, make a bitch get undressed 
Make people in the club want to dance chest to chest 
Bruised falcon, strive for perfection like Malcolm

So now the ticket's weakened, I stay away from tricks

I want my gold plaque for this shit 
Soon as the stores get it (you get it) 
Focused Daily, Likwit activity

My chest is burning from the Hennesy rock 
Yo I live to see the enemy drop

It's political, the way I smash down is pitiful 
Situation critical, barely breathin in a hospital 
Dead meat, we give it like professional athletes 
The elite wit a chick for everyday of the week 
I'm talking Monday through Sunday 
Models walkin up and down the runway 
I take a lethal role in the gunplay 
To finish wit flyin colors, Tha Alkaholik brothers 
Connected, respect it, ain't no choice but to love us 
It's not, east to west, I want the whole world behind me 
I got niggas in L.A. sayin ""Fuck Guiliani"" 

I'm hella-cocky on the mic, I fuck it up on jeep beats 
So while you rockin to this beat, the beat is rockin to me 
Foul-mouth CaTashTrophe, I knock heads since '93 
So when you come across my style, it's like you smacked into a tree 
I turn the heat up in this bitch, I make the women strip fast 
So no matter what you do you can't fuck wit Big Tash 
I came to kick your ass, quick fast, not to house you 
I want your homies saying ""Tash smacked the shit out you"" 
Smoke something, drink something, eat lyrics that twist 
This that shit that's on your baby momma's Christmas list 
So balls amount to this, no matter what y'all niggas name is

I got the uncanny ability to cold rock a show 
I got fired from my job 'cause I was late to my shift 
'Cause I was drinkin a fifth, wit John Jingle Heimer Smith 
And here's another caper from the lyric landscaper 
I write flows wit two by fo's wit sand paper 
Now what is a MC if he can't flow 
Up next is E-Swift and my name is J-Ro 

We don't give a fuck if you down wit such and such 
You can still get touched, by the Likwit bumrush 
Better train hard before you face me 
You better off fightin Royce Gracey

Rippin MCs like cheap jeans

Got a microphone made out of chrome shaped like a spatula
Cause I'm flippin rhymes at three times the speed of lightning
You dare to compare to the golden bear it's kind of frightening
You can meditate, til you levitate, but never rate
Higher than a seven/eight, yeah I had to set em straight
I know you feelin these, I ramsack yo' facilities
I'm ill at ease, with these mc's, who ain't got no abilities
(get at me) I make mc's, run out like batteries
I roll the bleeze and then I blow like cannonball adderly

Cold enough
You try to get with likwit but yo' brew ain't cold enough
Cold enough

Fast money, fast cars, niggaz sleep until two
My likwit niggaz roundezous, we cop kung-fus and split em
When ""the freaks come out at night"" catash be right wit em
Stone-faced, but only when I'm loaded wit funs
Big guns, I'll make you do the nestea plunge
I only came to have some fun but I get caught up in the rapture
I don't even write lyrics no more, I manufacture
Cold shit, you know that old gold shit, that raw shit
That drunken alkahol shit that make you say, ""ahhh shit!""

We be creepin up on you like police on bikes

Hit up four-five and carson, scoop xzibit and brad

Slow down and hit a dip

Who party down at the club and show tha liks love
Even with creatine, injected in your spleen
You couldn't compete with my all-star likwit team

Turn up the level more so I can hear the shit forever more
I came out of nowhere, like predator
That's a metaphor, if you rap-impaired, you might say what happened there
While the be-boys clap and cheer, bring that beat back in here!
Nighttime is the right time to write rhymes
Why you wanna bite mine? I blow you away like white lines
I think you better let it go, get yo' ass off my pedestal
Before you need attention, and it's gonna be medical
If rap was basketball I'd have the earl the pearl handles
I drink everything but jack daniels

What's up though, Tash came to steal it like the Grinch 
While I'm leavin' niggaz puzzled like I said my shit in French 
But it's all Olde English that I'm bringin' from beneath 
Try to bite my style on wax and watch these lyrics crack your teeth 
Cause I make words Connect like Westside when I test glide 
My drunken lyrical hanglider, nobody's tighter 
Than a ruff rap provider, with ninety ways to peel ya 
So I know the three words (Tash'll kill ya) sound familiar 
I filter out the weak every time I speak 
I drink to hit the peak to make my mind go (beep) 
I'm def-da-fyin, you rappin' like my client 
Tryin to scrape me for the style that slam harder than Kobe Bryant 
Be quiet! This is Likwidation from the West

Wherever my crew go, same old scenario
Takin' over every show, rockin' on the radio-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

It's Tha Liks you know our repertoire, we party y'all
We treat every day like it's fuckin' Mardi Gras (y'know)
Y'all done started somethin' you just can't finish
Ten years deep in this game called rap business
We takin' hip-hop back, it's gettin' unbearable
Y'all done disrespected the game somethin' terrible
My Likwid Crew shower you, with rhymes that's incomparable
Beats so ridiculous it just ain't fair to you
We act stupid off the tonic and whiskey
Smoke so much weed you might think I'm a hippie
In the club drunk with my nigga King Tipsy
Lookin' for some hoes that we can toss like frisbies
Bail through the club belligerent like, ""Bitch Please"" (damn)
Tab at the bar is already like six G's
Everywhere we go, I roll with the same old gang
Doin' the same old thang, again and again

[Chorus]

Niggas know (y'all niggas know) 
On your marks get wet, three vets is on the set
It's nine years in the game and we ain't lost a step yet
We still in full effect with drunk rhymes that make the world spin
(While you starin at me nigga) Nigga, I'm starin' at your girlfriend
Women see us out and think my click is too obnoxious
Cause we bail around the party like we off a couple notches

We off a couple vodkas, home girl, we Likwid niggas
Take the time to get to blow us, tell yo' friends come kick it with us
Ha ha, all jokes aside, we slide slippers
Money fallin' out my pocket like I robbed nine strippers
Tash is, ""Animal House"" like Jon Belushi
I'll be drinkin all the sake while you eatin' all the sushi (damn)
(Whattup nigga?) It's still the same situation
Tha Liks be gettin' head from the same bitch you datin'
Ratin us a 9'll be a waste of your time
We tens with big ends so let the games begin (y'know)

[Chorus]

Niggas know y'all niggas know 
Niggas know y'all niggas know 

Yeah, yeah!
Imperialistic without doubt, the King'll blast your character out
So stop playin with it, you fadin in it
I stay with it, let me present the crown sound
Constricted with the Likwid, the ticket round town
The wicked wild sound unleashed out the cage
Plus the Alkaholiks got the bar on stage
Get pissy, Tipsy got a baggy full of cavi
J-Ro put D's on the Mavi'
Swift got TV's in the Caddy
Tash kept it all factory
The Likwid far from tacky
Even if I step in the Sky Bar, K-Swiss and hard khakis
Y'all niggas better be happy, let me bubble

Now, every-time-I-give-y'all-shit-that
Blow up the spot, fuck what you got
And bless and execute strategical plots
That's to ""Extinction Level Event"" these wack niggas offa this block
Me and Tha Alkaholiks havin a drink, watchin' y'all niggas get sick
Holdin ya stomachs 'til you earl in the sink
The type of dude I never put in my clicks, because you funny
And you be sittin' down with your legs crossed like a bitch
I be the foul mouth quick to toast y'all, so-called
Niggas who like to boast we let your bodies float along the coast y'all
This very given moment, opponent, niggas like you
Ain't allowed up in our circle 'cause we don't condone it
We love to microphone it, perhaps
What we gon' do instead is give y'all gutter beats and raw sewage raps
And for the last thing that I'ma make clear
That when we present watch your step when you be comin' round here

Every-time-we-give-y'all-shit-that

To make ya duck (said get down nigga what?) You know
We-got-shit-that-make-y'all-wild-out
To bounce in the truck (Aye yo, get with the funk, y'know)

This world's tryin' to make me crack, but it still ain't broke me
I fall down and just rebound like Charles Oakley
Hoes be like all he wanna do is poke me
Bitch what you think I wanna do, the hokey pokey?
Her boyfriend Smokey said he was gonna smoke me
Her daddy crazy loc he tried to beat me and choke me
And she still want me, keep blowin' up my Noki'
Tryin' to provoke me to fall for okey-dokey
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
I'm just spittin' liquid in the middle of the pit
Turn it up a bit, burn it up and hit the bomb
I'm iller than Sadaam takin' Carrie's mom to the prom
Cool and calm, Macken-Ro, Likwid don
Bust rounds with Busta Rhymes, then I roll up, one
You got ice I got ice, but who nice on these mics?
(You motherfucker!)

[Chorus]

We out for justice so bust this it's Busta and the Alkies
niggas wanna know the secret but they just can't get it out me
So they talk that shit about me but to me that's never not
They pop that shit across the room while I down another shot
I smoke a hefty bag of doz and black out, and lose composure
Close my eyes and throw a bottle (I'm fuckin' up) this party over
I still got that flare so just stare from over there
Cause I'm so accurate with guns I put parts in niggas hair
So I declare war, Tha Liks, we fierce competitors
The feds be checkin' fo' us writin' letters to these editors like,
""Tha Liks is veterans, they straight from California
We ain't even give a fuck when they sprayed that beer on us"" like
{Rah raraow) Just like a Dungeon Dragon
Taggin' Tash up on the wall while my pants is saggin'
Draggin' niggas through the mud clear blood all through the club
The quickest way to show some love is let a nigga hit your bud

The stunner, fuck with us y'all niggas must be buzzin'
I love it, we coulda been washed like dirty dishes
But the Genie in the Lamp gave Tash like 30 wishes
First I wished for health 'cause I be thinkin' bout myself
I be drinkin' by myself, livin' shrinkin like an elf
Next I wished for wealth, 90 million in the bank account
Young niggas with money, that's somethin' we need to think about
'Cause we could be the President, we could be the Senators
Right now niggas think we just drug dealers and janitors
We big, that's big, we large, in charge
I told the Genie next I want a car like the stars
A Bentley, a Coupe, a truck with the OOP
With the three level seats for when it's time to scoop my group
I thirst, for loops, I told the Genie next
I want the King Tee albums plus Xzibit on cassette
Next, I told the Genie like it or not
Last wish I hope you die 'cause I want yo' spot
Tash come from rock bottom want funk beats we got 'em
I can bust my shit in spring you won't catch it 'til next autumn

(Can we po' some mo'?) Got beer
Listen here, why y'all niggas could fight, but not in here

Whatcha want to do?

Where the smokey smoke?
Man I just broke a note, up in the club I'm choke

What you gonna do?

We came to beat it up
Break it on down and clown, order another round
(Do the damn thing) Please examine the
Way that we damage ya, peace out to Canada

With a new style tonight, we bout to

We rocking ninety-thousand underground at the raves
(Say what?) Dialogue is strange, I wrote this in the rain
I do what I do then I pop that champagne

Pop that champagne

Bitch, make yo' breath stink, and house party crashing it

Whatcha want to do?

We came to rock for y'all
And it don't stop at all, we bout to have a ball

Pose for the camera, are you a fan of the

Aiyyo we need some beer to the stage quick (quick-quick-quick)
Alkaholiks on the set (ooh-ooh!)
Y'all ready? (ooh-oop!) Uh

Aiyyo it's six million drinks to try, choose one
So you can catch a buzz while Likwid show you how it's done
Bouncin' off the walls is just my niggaz havin' fun
With all these weak niggaz, why the fuck'd we lose Pun?
Damn it's a trip to see the world twist around us
But Tha Alkaholik clique, a.k.a. the 40 downers
Gets twisty, twisty, yak and brews
Black Rob flows is ""Whoa!"", Tha Liks is like ""Whoo!""
Is there a doctor in the house cause somebody gonna need him
Tash fight for his right to party, I need my freedom
So I can drink in public without the cops eyin' me
F.B.I. spyin' me cause everybody buyin' me

[Chorus]
I got drunk and got down with Tha Liks
But before I put it down all I need is a fix
Now bust a nut - I rhymes aways on different days
And everybody wonder how I stay so blazed
I'm like a sickness; I'm like a sickness but there is no cure
And when you hear my voice don't it sound so pure
Tha Alka-holiks know, come bust fo' sho'
So whether we together kickin' down the doors

From Lake Buteras to Paris generic rappers get embarrassed
We inherit b-boy Sermons just like Erick's
Liks been flowin' longer than your grandparent's marriage
Eatin' buzzed brownies more than Bugs eat carrots
Kick back in the 'llac like a horse and a carriage
Spittin' ""The Facts of Life"" more than Tudy and Ms. Garrett
When I'm runnin' my errands Dayton rims feel like Ferris

Get socked in your larynx, if yo' ass get careless

Aiyyo who stole the soul? I did cause I was desperate
Send a random note to Loud - I want a million for my next shit
I know you got the money Steve just reach into that grab bag
Then step back and watch me drop these ""Bombs On Baghdad""
Cause Tash rap melodical, drunk periodical
Niggas think they hot but I'm seein' they ain't got it though
I'm from L.A. you from Idaho, no skills you gotta go
Fo' albums deep, so y'all motherfuckers gotta know
We birds of a feather so we, smoke together
Tha Liks and Rocwilder gonna, choke whoever
Ain't in this motherfucker comin' raw dog style
Hold my drink Mr. Tan while I jump in the crowd

[Chorus]

Excuse my gutter language, but fuck bein' famous
Robust for nameless don of rhymin' china chain less
Olde English ancient drive Chevy's with paint chips
I breathe herb, so they say my words is tainted
Let's take it back to ""Colors"" get your face painted 
With fat caps
I got more rhymes in my mind than you can fit in your backpacks
Go 'head, eat 'em up like snack packs
I stay busy like crack shacks
I like my hoes with the lickable toes
And the silver dollar nipples that be pokin' out the clothes
Now I suppose you want flows like MackinRo's
Cause you be standin on the stage at all our motherfuckin' shows
James Robinson, even my name is dominant
Lyrics astonishin' from the Likwid Conglomerate
My crew in it, I'm in it, so we remain prominent
Rap game I'm bombin' it, it's too much Uncle Tom in ït

Aiyyo tha Alkies set the trends that the whole world follow
Fuck a CD, fuck a tape, we should sell this shit in bottles
Are you a role model?
Not, ca tash'll steal yo' beat box
I drink cuss and smoke and sock niggaz with cheap shots

The gunner wonder man, wonder woman husband
The stunner fuck with us y'all niggaz must be buzzin'
I love it, we coulda been washed like dirty dishes
But the Genie in the Lamp gave Tash like 30 wishes

First I wished for health 'cause I be thinkin' 'bout myself
I be drinkin' by myself, livin' shrinkin' like an elf
Next I wished for wealth, 90 million in the bank account
Young niggaz with money, that's somethin' we need to think about

'Cause we could be the President, we could be the Senators
Right now niggaz think we just drug dealers and janitors
We big, that's big, we large, in charge
I told the Genie next I want a car like the stars

A Bentley, a coupe, a truck with the oop
With the three level seats for when it's time to scoop my group
I thirst, for loops, I told the Genie next
I want the King Tee albums plus Xzibit on cassette

Next, I told the Genie like it or not
Last wish I hope you die 'cause I want yo' spot
Tash come from rock bottom want funk beats we got 'em
I can bust my shit in spring you won't catch it 'till next autumn

We taught them niggaz how to rhyme this hot
We drink a lot, smoke a lot, da da da da, da da da da

Babylon and chron' six foes on the line
Smashin' down Avalon like a ghetto amazon
Brown bagger; take it to the head like Marvin Haggler
Livin' underground like a badger

Wall to wall like a tagger, original pants sagger
Bite my rhymes and your whole grill might shatter
Remi and Hennessey, fuckin' up my bladder
If your girl say she know me then I probably got at her

Sometimes I'm hard to find like downtown parkin' spaces
I'ma be old and gray and still flirtatious
Remove my shoes for foot races, primitive man ate fish
But M C's are the latest on my dish mentally spacious

You didn't create this so you, naturally hate this
Wait Miss, do you like what you see? How do you rate this?
Relax I'm not a rapist just one of the greatest
Born winner hair full of basses opposite of weightless

Mastered the art of holdin' bottles double-fisted
X.O Hennessey fifth, unassisted
We not promotin' drinkin', we just havin' some fun
Fuck it, we drink in Appleton and Nantucket

Mashin' down Van Nuys, puffin' stress in the bucket
Ghetto hip hop for the public, you love it
At Lovitz, you love the Alkaholik wino
Pissin' off the strippers up in the spearmint rhinos
You like that? A like da da da da

Okay, here we go, original, liquor sto' flow
Ghetto non-mellow pissy drunk alkapella yo'
Average, everyday around the hood fellows
Though we always bring the ruckus we some wild motherfuckers

Niggaz call me CPR, I help rap music breathe
With beats and rhymes you wouldn't believe
What I did is that you couldn't conceive
With a ho on each sleeve with a crew of niggaz rollin' on D's

It's them Alkaholik niggaz flowin' with the toilet niggaz
Party crashin' raid-thrashin' beer-smashin' brolic niggaz
Peers drinkin' irrational thinkin' don't give a fuck about nuttin'
Blame it on the alcohol consumption

Yeah we overdid it, I had to admit it
It's tha Liquid, we underground rap music's prime ticket
Sick wid it, E-Swift be quick with it
Every time I spit it forget it, y'all need to quit it, sing it

Oh, yeah, we got drums
Woo, Alkaholiks, let's get it crackin' y'all
Ay J-Ro, teach these niggaz how to stunt

People gather round, J-Ro is on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, sing songs called 'Survival'
Chillin' in my drawers in hotels like the Bible
Alkaholiks, West coast legends is the title

I can't shoot you with my knife, I can't stab you with my gun
So the only thing left is to hit you with the drums
Uh, huh, uhh, we in this bitch, no kickin' back
J-Ro, tell these niggaz where the fuck you sippin' at

Yo, I'm sippin' on the dock of the bay, puffin' on hay
Used to sell bombay and sip Andre
West West like Kanye, I got the rhythm like Kwame
I used to have a crush on Shante

Yo, E-Swift, I don't think that you bent
But goddamn homeboy, where all the gin went?
J-Ro, yo, I believe that's me
Say what? You up next on the Hennessey

And once you hear the Capital J, rap, it'll stay
In your brain all day, it always happens that way
I come from L.A., Cali, East side of the Valley
Dilly-dally, ran through an alley

Runnin' through an alley in my corduroy flip-flops
We drink a lot of beer so it's that West coast hip-hop
Kick box our way out of trouble, just to bubble
Meet us at the bar y'all, where everybody love you

Yo, my rhymes at parties, took out more MC's than brown Bacardi
I'm totally gnarly
Stumble through the crowd like excuse me, pardon me
Sip hops and barely 'til I pop an artery

My beats so fly, niggaz try to charter me
I'm an Alkaholik but that's only one part of me
My main man Tash is like Cool Raoul
He got bitches butt-naked in the swimming pool

I'm rowdy, I'm cocky, I'm like Jeremy Shockey
I'm a giant in this game, y'all better back up off me
You also the most frosty, drink until we saucy
Keep bitches up all night like black coffee

Yeah, you know Cinnamon, she hang with crazy Kim and them
They always in the club, tryin' to take a nigga's Benjamins
Feminine women, we be runnin' all up in 'em
Then we send 'em home broke
Because we wouldn't spend a cent on 'em

Aiyyo CaTash, a people person, shake hands and kiss babies
Politician in my mission, stack grands and spit crazy
I roll with a tight crew like Mushmouth and Russell
Girls wanna grab my love muscle and suckle

Got trees in my duffel, get a ride from the airport
I take the shuttle, no need for rebuttal
Huddle round your speaker, got the system blastin'
And we takin' everything, it ain't no need for askin'

Got the headbangin' beats, so nigga pass the aspirin
We bumrushin' the door in an un-orderly fashion
This is the year that we cash in
Catch me in Miami in the sun just baskin'

Catch me in L.A. in the streets just mashin'

It's time to put you kids on restriction
So just sit down, shut your trap up and listen
Major labels are greasy like Kentucky Fried Chicken

I'm sick of the bitchin'
I'll send you players home like a baseball team with no pitchin'
I hate to lose, I'm addicted to addition
Girl, I brighten your life like nuclear fission

So gimme the life
If the punani tight it make you feel alright
But back to the mission
You couldn't hit if Jazze Pha, Kanye and Dre did the mixin'

Your whole life is fiction
Like a fat girl in corduroys, too much friction
I got bags of green like Peggy Lipton
Be careful when you pick up this jam, it's heavy liftin'

Just do it, if you put your mind to it, pursue it and do it
If you like to rhyme to the music then do it
Girl, if you wanna grind to the music, just do it

What? Just do it, whatever it is, you wanna do it, just do it
It's all on you, just follow through and do it
Ain't nobody holdin' you back now, do it
What? Just do it, what? Just do it

Me and J-Ro hold the mic, while E-Swift pumps the drums
We make it happen with the rappin' while y'all niggaz bump y'all gums
For large sums of cash, CaTash'll wreck any party
Mic skills is real, I'll go head up with anybody

Bacardi party favorite, rockin' all engagements
I ruined yo' engagement 'cause I left with who you came in with
My flow is so amazin', it gets reviewers ravin'
You niggaz keep repeatin', I come with new statements

Shine, baby, shine, 'cause it's the top of the line
Y'all keep rappin' 'bout them nines 'til I pop you with mine
Make you stop on a dime and then it's Miller Time, right then
I'm always standin' out in a crowd because I'm light skinned

I might bend the rules, nah nigga, CaTash break 'em
It's easy meetin' chicks but it's hard as fuck to shake 'em
I take 'em to my house, I lay 'em flat on my couch
And they can blame it on the liquor while I'm diggin' 'em out

Just do it, if you put your mind to it, pursue it and do it
If you like to rhyme to the music then do it

It's all on you, just follow through and do it
Ain't nobody holdin' you back now, do it
What? Just do it, what? Just do it

I know you wanna be like me, see what I see
But don't do what I do, try to be great
But be great bein' you, you wanna get respect
You gotta pay yo' dues, play by the rules

And don't follow those fools
You wanna be gangster then you better have the tools
Semi automatic, teardrop tattoos and beef with crews y'all
Better have a seat, I'm the bearer of bad news

I ain't talkin' shit, I'm just droppin' a few boos
My niggaz hold out arms like lady sings the blues
This ain't the same thing that you're used to
I ain't sellin' dope or braggin' 'bout how many times I'ma shoot'cha

Niggaz can't hold me like D. Wade
Can't even count the times my highlights have been replayed
Rap Sports Center, live with no delay

But I gotta lotta homies that would love to see you buried

[Chorus: x2]

Aye yo my style ain't never switch I serve hook to hook
I'm still an Alkie in my ways, I never shook the look
You can see it in my face, I'm here to cook the rooks
Promoters lookin' at me funny like they booked a crook
Sheeeit, I'm over here with Clipper chippers
With a gang of strippers downin these liquid mixtures
If my money make you sick, then I hope you feel better
I'ma grab me a bitch and slap some tail feathers
Y'all niggas can't even spell clever
While I take my time and write from the heart like jail letters
The ice might fool you from the wrist to the necklace
But if you out there talkin' shit you on a reckless nigga's checklist
This the West, where Deebo lives
Where chicks run around claimin' these is Rico's kids
Uh-uh, 'cause everybody wants somethin' from me
The niggas want my style and the bitches want my money

[Chorus]

I'm a wax carnivore
Eat beats like meat, hope you like it raw
Fuck it, I'm the next Curtis Shaw
Mixed with Marley Marl y'all heard thus far
Spar with the track, so my wind's up to par
Know a few Alkies, got friends at the bar
Get the club jumpin' like the pumps on my car
Front and back like the strippers that star
Damn, or like six-deuces on the 'Shaw
Might tap your jaw like ? if we brawl
And I ain't even battlin' y'all
I ride the tracks that the others just straddle and fall
Platinum plaques, I got stacks this tall
Looks like I got Baby's teeth on my wall
I'm +Hot Boy+, my whole click sick like Sars
We roll through and plug chicks like a pause

[Chorus: x2]",The Get Down,2006
Tha Alkaholiks,"What? Yeah
Did the phone ring baby?
(We have a collect call from James Robinson, a.k.a. J-Ro)
What? (comin' all the way from Malmo, Sweden)
Say what? (Will you accept?)
Hell motherfuckin' yeah I'll accept, J-Ro? What's goin' on?
Whattup J? Shit, look

Why do every move I make I feel like everybody's watchin' us
I see the world clear just like I'm lookin' through binoculars
The L.A., C-A, the cities of metropolis
The L-I, K-S, ain't nobody stoppin' us
Eternal with the burner, fast-paced but slow learner
Beatin' me that's like Ike gettin' slapped by Tina Turner
Nigga I'm the best rapper E-Swift has found
That's why you keep gettin' skipped, I keep gettin' rewound

Attention on the compound, Alkaholiks in town
We came to blaze it down, amazing astound
West coast party kings, we world renowned
Aye yo we flood the area, we watch you clowns drown
(Say what?) If you want my crown, why'ontcha meet me downtown
I turn the world around, make you earl on the ground
And take the politician's smile, turn it to a frown
Then walk in the club and buy the bar with one round

[Chorus: x2]
Likwit music, drinkin music
Sip your fluid and get into it
Will you party with Tha Liks? (Hell yeah we'll do it!)
Come and party with Tha Liks, all the drinks included

Aye yo my nigga B. Ganz said the world about to end
I went to sleep and woke up, right back at it again
I got some juice I got some gin I party down y'all niggas too thug
Take a sip of this, it make you dance like Uncle June bug
These new drugs designer, I'm an old-timer rhymer
If your highness sing for me, I might sign her on consignment
You can't take your chances with these brand new dances
Tha Liks lift the party on up like breast enhancements

I feel at home on the range, my lyrics blow out your brains
Keep my eyes on the prize without the Gucci frames
So simple and plain, Southern Cali never rains
I left Alice in Chains, with some DNA stains
Met this girl at the mall in the Gap
I thought she was all of that, well she called me, but I didn't call her back
She was like baby baby but I didn't fall for that
I've been keepin' it pimpin ever since I saw ""The Mack""

[Chorus]

We takin' over your city, commanderin' your radio
A.P.B. through your TV and stereo
Live broadcast, here's the newsflash
Y'all niggas ain't lookin' for Swift, J and Tash
Mash through your district, drunk and lifted
Bangin beats so loud the equator shifted
My crew is gifted, and you ain't miss shit
The next ten years you gettin' showered with Likwit
It's the, mischievous, devious, at first you didn't believe in us
Now we got the world singin' songs by the three of us
We ain't slowin' down, matter fact we bout to speed it up
Keep up with the tempo the instrumental ain't simple
And Tha Liks, is essential, for music fans to get into
We don't hold it back, we let it go on the track
And the whole fact is y'all niggas know that you whack
And we don't give a FUCK if you sold a lot of plaques

It's Likwit crew, nigga, we straight from Los Angeles

It's the L, the I, the K, the Ss
We still the West's freshest 'cause we started from the essence
Look, Ma, no hands, they gave us microphone stands
So I can stand with two bottles while I dance with the fans

Dance with me, press against me 'cause I'm reachin' out to grab it
Slappin' asses 'cause CaTashtrophe's an Alkie chick magnet
I'm a beauty pageant judge with a glass full of buds
It's one fifty nine, they're tryin' to shut down the club

Last call for alcohol, unless you meet us at the after hours
Pull up to the front, yeah, baby girl, the house is ours
Don't bug, spillin' shit on my rug
I'm a Rollo with a motto, safe sex, soft drugs

Thugs in my mansion askin' why the fuck is candles lit
I'm about to kick these niggaz out but I can handle it

If you scary change the channel, y'all niggaz fuckin' up my shit

Handle business appropriate, we L.A. street associates
I'm tryin' to have some fun but peep this bullshit I'm copin' with
Niggaz with guns got they eyes on my funds
I can't walk out my door, y'all might pop me an' run

Don't trip 'cause my pump made 'em run like Forrest Gump
Now it's back to the bitches, the bottles an' the bumps
Pumpin' up the sounds 'cause that's how we do

Yo, the bass is in the place, sho' nuff shrugged your face
Like R. Kelly gettin' sprayed with a can of mace
Girls get freaky to the funky beat bumpin'
Which one of y'all down 'cause I'm tryin' to beat somethin'

We hold down the city, they call us 'The Drunk Flowers'
If your girl from L.A., she probably already know us
So Braniac dumb dums, bust the scientifical
We much more than typical, bust flows like a pistol

The words I spit are more dangerous than a bullet
Make the wrong move, I'm on your neck like a mullet
'Big Dog' style, we Rottweiler, pitbull it
Smoke a bleezy with a breezy if she ain't scared to pull it

y'all women used to want us to just love an' hold ya
Now you see-walkin', talkin' 'bout you need a soldier
I send this missile in yam I destroy an' dismantle it

See I'm Eddie Murphy 'Raw' no tight ass riches
See these haters throw salt 'cause they superstitious
When it rains it pours yeah I know the sayin' fella

That'll turn any mad dog into an Old Yeller

I take freaks and then I push 'em to the point of insanity
Cause I've been rockin' mics since Prince was fuckin' Vanity

Honk honk, they bleepin' out my cuss words
My kids never see they think I'm cleaner than the suburbs

Wolfpack rush, better run like you're Donovan
Or niggaz'll crack your head like they tryin' to cook omelettes

Back of the Cadillac is all packed with my conglomerate
Automatic strap pack clack clack is not promisin'
Sit back, relax, sip 'gnac without vomitin'

I'll be like, one time, you can get these here
I'm movin' mo' numbers than Britney Spears

If you catch me, you'll probably give me 50 years

'Cause I got a few, super models hangin' on my sleeve
Thirty niggaz from the hood with chucks and white tees

And we don't want trouble, we just tryin' to bubble
Pop bottles, pour shots, hit the scene and leave
With a little scenery, smoke a little greenery
So you ain't gotta be mean to me

Nigga feel the impact I make the crowd react
When I let off, it's somethin' like a terrorist attack

The West coast ain't went nowhere but up the street
To get a half ounce of kush, a couple bitches and the heat

I would fix it if it's broke but we far from broke homey

Only way to stop CaTash, is jump out the bushes
Or snipe me through a window while I put away the dishes
But that'll never happen, I'ma dyin' at this rappin'

No chance for survival for the Likwit rivals

And I just kicked a timepiece up outta my room

And it's been a couple minutes and I'm gettin' lonely
I need another Cali-Rony who only smokes the stony
Green like green tea, I sip the Likwit

Let's good

I plan out my hustle for the day then take a shower
When your ? dope, everybody jealous
When you come up short, everybody tellin' you 'bout
Who got that dope to sling tonight, who got the music
And the song uncut, everything you tellin'
You the ghetto symphony (believe it)

Poverty is paradise ask me how I know (how you know)
You see the niggas on the corner and you know they smokin' wood
Chasin' dollars and Impalas, it's the same way in yo' hood
Poverty is paradise ask me how I know (how you know)
I see the ladies on they hustle, makin' dollars in the club
Feedin' babies, her Mercedes, came from niggas stolen drugs

I know what it feels like to wake up broke
And face another day with'cha back against the ropes
And I also know how to survive the struggle
When shit gets tough you gotta up your hustle
Set some new goals, raise your self-esteem
Don't let nothin' intervene or get in between
If you gotta push weight, keep your money clean
And if you gotta strip girl, be the best you can be
If you gotta run scams then, cover your trail
Cause it's hard feedin' babies when you locked in jail
If you can't hold a job 'cause you just got out
Try another route, you know what I'm talkin' about
And when you do make it big give back to the hood
So when you gotta go back it's still to the good
Stay loyal to your people, show 'em that you care
Cause in the end you know they be right there, just remember that

[Verse One]
Freeze, at ease, now let me drop some more of them keys
It's 19-9-tre so let me just play
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre
But this time I'ma hit yo' ass with a touch
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg I'm at the top of the stack
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checkin'
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearin' on the record
It's me, ya see, S-N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-why, the D-O-double-G

And I'm high till I dizzie, rizzide

I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie
I'm crazy, you can't phase me
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress
I'm all about the chronic, bionic ya see
Every single day, chillin' with the D-O-double-G's
P-O-you-N-D that's my clique, my crew
Ya fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up 
I thought ya knew, but yet and still
Ya want to get real, now it's time to peel, ya say chill
And feel, the motherfuckin' realism
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the mic I'm hittin' hard as steel nigga

[Verse Two]
How many hoes in your motherfuckin' group
Want to take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and really don't give a shit
About nothin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be ryhmin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin'

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I come creepin' through the fog with my saggin' Dukes
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille
I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin' in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket loc
Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow

But we got something old, and something new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's going on
It make me want to holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfucking hoes
Seaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfucking paws
Y'alls, niggas, better recognize
And see where I'm coming from it's still East Side till I die
Why ask why?  As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-why

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten

I had your whole fucking block bumping
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fucking menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and popping
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping
I want to see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog
You can't do me, I'm going out looney like O-Dog

Diggity Daz out of the motherfucking cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow

Till I die I'm still screaming that (bitches ain't shit)
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-you-N-D, the gangsta clique

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flagging me down
Saying, ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? Hey yo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?""
I said, if you ain't up on things
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thing, to gang-bang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon 'cause
I drops bombs like Platoon (hey nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't want to be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well

Suicide, it's a suicide

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this!
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fucking chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruff-neck
Now everybody scream 'nough respect to the X
'Nough respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living

Tha Dogg Pound,"Nine in the mornin' feds at my door (my door) 
Lou Cortez creakin' cross the hardwood floor (right) 
Dippin' through the alley I made my escape 
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape 
Man with no music but happy he's free 
Bailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street 
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand 
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand 
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC 
Remotely controlled by the bombity 
But just livin' in big city is a serious task 
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask 

We're comin' with that G shit, that see shit that makin' niggas sick 
How does it feel to see a G from your clique? 
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?) 
Last night's dice game got my win on 
About a G and a half is what I come with 
But twenty five G's is what I left with 
Teatley was the word I heard 
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone 
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas 
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie 
Seven-four-four-tre back to back 
I sent two fools back to their lizzack 

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift 
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip 
But I chill 'cause my ho might call 
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall 
And I takes a quick walk up the block 
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop 
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin' 
That's where a nigga'll be slangin 
I'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me 
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki 
And now the shops on deck 
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step 
Now I got ends 
And I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends 
But I could only trust a few 
And unawarely I trusted you 
But if only G 

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go 
Devoted and quotin', back in '84 
I was thirteen, G was a year older 
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders 
Gettin' good on the hood was the anticipation 
And yeah, King Park was the destination 
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night 
Even the smokers that be levellin' gettin' sparked tonight 

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey 
'Cause I represent like every day 
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot 
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot 
From at least about five years ago 
When I was in junior high goin' to Marshall 
The homey use to come up to the school and rock 
And leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock 
Damn them was the days of the past 
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin' people's ass 
And everybody a blast 
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz 
And that's your ass 
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha) 
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust) 
'cause I let it sit that day 
I wished I was there I would've clowned 
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound 
'cause he wouldn't even squad back 
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that 
He'll get us all cracked 
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap 
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!) 
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah) 

Some of these nigga are bitches too 
And some of these niggas look just like you 
So if you've ever been toetone 
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on 

It's 5:30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin 
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee 
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack 
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack 
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection 
And let me dial slow, flossin', tossin' a bitch (bitch) 
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention 
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten 
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends 
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal 
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G 
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me 

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you 
So what made them niggas try to spit at you 
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you 
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too 

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha) 
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you 
'Cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes 
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota 
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt 
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk 
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest 
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up 
My hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin' 
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots 
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah) 
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1 
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know 
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho 
Swoop G by the fuckin' L-be	's-see 
None of these nigga want to fuck with these (aah)

But they can't do it, you know
So we gonna, do it like this

Have you ever heard of a slughter, I oughta start dippin
Sippin on that S-T get's me to trippin

With that mad ass Dogg Pound Gang it's a DPG thang
Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental
I subdue, and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin
Niggaz collapse and when the straps is clickin
Look, this is how it's done nigga (one two three)
I grab my strap you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click

Shit, a motherfucker betta recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone ever since I was bown
Not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best

Every single day in the LBC
Cruisin through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' bustin free styles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place?
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck wit my crew

I see all these niggaz tryin to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggaz layin low on the East Coast
And the question is asked
Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocckout and every nigga down with him
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killer
And I steal a half, motherfucker cuz it's like that

Creepin and crawlin through yo' hood 
Smokin, loc'in... provokin punk motherfuckers like good stuff 
What's happenin? 
[Kurupt] 
In the dead of winter, is when I kick my coldest phrases 
Mental as telepathy, lyrically it amazes 
Construction of thoughts that's lethal as turpentine 
An expert when I flex rhymes feared like ex-cons in my zone (zone) 
You can't even find like Atlantis 
Stalk like a prayin mantis, leavin battered bodies 
on the canvas, the burial ground for clowns 
Open casket trackin niggaz down like fuckin basset hounds 
Tragic how the mic gets handled 
Prodigious like a vandal on a midnight scandal 
and scramble like Randall abusive when I recite 
on the stage step out exits with a brand new motherfuckin mic 
[Dat Nigga Daz] 
Now can I grab the microphone and spit some shit 
that's known to blow the mind of Michelangelo's poems 
Clones get crushed like stones, I forbid 
For rusty motherfuckers to be acting like they all in 
With the Click I checks that shit, nd once again it's on 
And it's on with the gangsta shit 
I create the beats that beats the fucks right outta ya speakers 
Amps are blown, shown for me to grab the microphone alone 
like Jodeci, notice see your self needs help 
The homie style got the strap on deck 
Don't neglect the fact I can make you or break you (break you) 
Awake you to a new plateau wit mo' hoes 
Now the paper is made, and now I don't think twice 
Niggaz is gettin pimped, because they game ain't tight 
Now well well (well), now welcome where the ballers dwell 
Another day, another dollar, blueberry to sell 
I makes that fast cash, hmm Dat Nigga Daz 
I'm quicker the outslicker, blast then dash 
[Kurupt] 
D-P-G, eliminates the whole area 
Beyond the thought dismemberin, motherfuck surrenderin 
Who what where, let's tear shit the fuck up 
The homies coolin, while you and, your chest get fuckin blew in 
Provoke us, invade with the superior focus 
I'm that nigga like Daz, crooked as scoliosis 
Impossible to survive, on my arrival when I arrive 
it's left to ya instict of survival 
Mashin, cashin in chips, I gotta lick sadistic sick mind 
They define it I'm mentally sick, and badder 
It doesn't matter when you're enterin 
You just entered in the war zone all alone 
with ya microphone unguarded, I just started 
Poetical Poltergeist precise and cold-hearted 
Empty, tempt me, simply ya get shot 
Ya forgot I'm down to empty out my clip on ya block 
Stop, let the whole place evacuate 
Wait until we're face-to-face then it escalates 
Duck down, Kurupt clowns niggaz daily, hoes can't play me 
Observe I serve those that betray me 
[Nate Dogg] 
I ain't never seen a joint that I couldn't light 
And I ain't never seen a buster that didn't fight 
I ain't never seen a G that would go for that 
Especially when he knows Tha Dogg Pound got his back 
I ain't never seen a game that did multiply 
We gettin kinda deep,yeah the crew and I

[Snoop] And who am I?

Verse One: Dat Nigga Daz 
Working LA 
tryin to get paid tha right way 
but somehow the right way don't pay 
I'm comin home late every night 
gotta struggle an fight 
wit tha baseheads on tha late night hype 
tryin to creep in tha house 
through tha cut 
for what 
so I won't be seen by none of the homies 
but tha homie Nate Dogg spots me 
and say Yo what's happenin 
No you don't know me no more 
when ya pass me tha satin 
I said ah naw it ain't like that G 
I'm trying to go straight 
and have a J-O-be	 
you need to quit that faggot ass job 
that's what he said 
showed me his grip and took some satin to tha head 
Damn that nigga had at least two G's 
and he was clockin it wit so much ease 
I told him I was gone so I'm headin in tha house 
everybody knocked out 
so I'm locked out 
I go back to tha front 
where my homies is hangin at 
they offer me a cabby sack 
so I can start slangin dat 
they say you ain't a hustler 
I say don't doubt it 
Hold dat thought 
and I'll think about it 
because 
Chorus: Nate Dogg 
[I've been dreamin to long, to long, to long] 
I don't like to dream about gettin paid 
Verse Two: Dat Nigga Daz 
The thought's complete so let me take a seat 
since I was born and raised on tha streets 
I quit tha job I had 
caught myself a sack 
went from a double of fifty into a ceno stack 
within a week but my peak wouldn't reach 
I was gettin too known on tha north side of Long Beach 
Niggas got to trippin and I thought I heard it 
so I went to tha hood 
on Twentieth and Murder 
I came up quick with some homies dat I knew from way way back 
and bid my sack 
or maybe it's seven 
or was it eight hundred strong 
In other words Daz had it goin on 
I bought myself a bucket 
That's right a bucket bitch 
who you fuck in my car on my dick 
My lifeself switched a bit 
but my attitude didn't 
I told all my old bitches good riddance 
'cause when you got money hoes come automatically 
and no hoes don't do nothing but cause some static see 
I went from khakis to guess braids to a fade 
I'm not Special Ed but I had it made 
livin tha life of a baller care free 
havin bitches dyin to sleep wit me ya see 
But I went bankrupt from all the spending and gamblin 
business was gettin slow 
and I wasn't handlin 
mine tha way I was supposed to 
Now I'm broke and on a jack mission 
so don't get close to 
tha D-P-G gang cause we scandalous when we broke 
We get tha doggs in in us 
we get ta actin like some 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Nate Dogg, Kurrupt 
Last night I had a dream 
felt so good it had to be 
me and my homies were gettin paid 
man oh man we had it made 
some homies want to roll wit me 
some homies claim insanity 
well if you want to set trip I will 
if you don't want to drop be still 
Damn 
I can't believe this 
but you can best believe this 
today 
I'm on another mission to get paid 
serve what I can serve right [right] 
so my pockets will stack up 
nigga don't trip 
nigga back up [hold up] 
I gots to react off the first impulse I find 
but my mama thinks I should take my time 
and work for mines 
but how much work would it take 
and how much money would I make 
wait 
there's somethin I gotta think about 
but I ain't got that much time 
moms want a nigga out tha house 
I ain't gettin no younger 
I'm only gettin older 
I'm only 
thinking about what my mama told me 
Now I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta for life 
and the fact that I'm out to get paid twice 
I ain't nuttin nice 
down to slang or pull a heist 
jack or break mutha fuckas on the dice 
That's real 
Now what should I do 
Just chill when it's time to peel caps and adapt to kill 
I've concealed tha concealed 
so I've maintained for tha salary 
and my mentally is raw from tha door 
I go hard from tha door

I'm on top of the world
With niggaz with perms and Jheri curls
Runnin' around town with the flyest girls
Ain't no place like home, nigga that I can call my own

Smokin' dove sacks and quarter pounds
Down to ozones
I'm Dat, nigga, D A to the Z
A motherfuckin playa, for the D P to the G

Connectin' lyrics like dot to dot, connectin' blocks

Termination completed, and I'm out like the seasons
Murderin' MC's for no fuckin' apparent reason

And you best to be able to walk that walk, because
We ride right, daylight, or after midnight

Niggaz oppose me to get cracked like the pipe
Born in the East, raised a G on the West
Westide, smokin' and rollin' with a S on my chest

I roll swift as a pigeon, diggin' niggaz graves in tomb stones alone
One on one, microphone or phone
Stampedin' like a heard of buffalo you tumble
Now when you try to get up, motherfucker you stumbled

Now it's a must that I can bust, from the shots from my 12 gauge
Dust to get you high blown in the meanwhile my profile
Of my styles unusual from a buckwild child
But in the meanwhile

I can tear that ass off be like an Al B. song
I maul fifty MC's, divided just by one
Now who's the greatest motherfucker other than myself
Droppin' lyrical vitamins for your health, motherfucker

One by one, we'll start to subtract
And see how many motherfuckers got your back
'Cause when it comes down to it, we outs to clown
It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down

One by one, we'll start to subtract

It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down

Now picture that ass and frame it, what a shame
motherfucker to remain to obtain game

I'm on another journey, my mind set on twisted
Gettin' twisted and twist this fool for his grip then dash
Daz in the Jeeps that the church drive
'Cause he don't give a fuck, and down to put in work

And this is how it's done like one two three
Kurupt, and I'm quick to fuck shit up on G.P., lethal
There's no stoppin' me, top notch, there's no equal
To the philosophies that I concoct

We makin' examples out of motherfuckers like you
Nigga there's no idea, nigga, and there's no clue, you through
You outta here motherfucker, finished you scared admit it
Your new album, shit

So realize with your two eyes that my rhyme hypnotize
Just like Jim Jones bapnitized his followers
The wrath, of the slaughter, have you ever heard of a
Serve from my homey now he rhyme for baby sharks

And I load for ammo for ammo the young hollow is dippin'
To Pomona Ave to ride up on you on the corner
It's kinda cold, how his ass got smoked
And now you know that we ain't no joke

I never trust a busta, so I never trust yo' ass
Hope you got satellites around when we bust yo' ass
I peeped you out the sides of my eyes, 'cause I be peepin'
Murderous situations, you got yourself knee deep in

You're walkin' around while you're sleepin'
So awake yourself nigga then break yourself
And I don't give a fuck if your money is spent
I want your hat to your clothes 'cause dollars make sense

I got so many hoes on my dick, I gotta shake hoes
And I'm controllin' mines, like Waco
Texas, Mr. Flossy in the Lexus
Super supreme I plot schemes like Stephen King and

One by one, we'll start to subtract
And see how many motherfuckers got your back
'Cause when it comes down to it, we outs to clown
It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down

Tha Dogg Pound,"What is reality?
Motherfuckers out here don't know shit
They ain't tryin to know shit
Just a dumb motherfucker out here tryin to represent
Get my motherfuckin paper
You don't think so? Well then fuck you hoe
'Cause I'm ridin on trucks, banked all that type of shit
Gotta get paid motherfucker

Fuck dreamin the same dreams, bein down for the same team
When it seems to be reality is just a dream
Eye to eye, the colors that I wear is do or die
When I walk down the street, will I meet evil in disguise
So, I tote a fo'-fo' with hollow tips
While my mind tellin me 'should I not', or 'should I peel it?'
What I represent God only knows what lies for myself
Jealousy and hatred niggaz is out for my wealth
Will I perish? Later selfish for the rest of my life
Cause those who live wrong is bound to live a short life
Will money be the root of my destruction?
Without the money I can't even seem to function

Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality
As complex as the situation gets
I remain I maintain, ain't that much strain
To make me twist myself like Kurt Cobain
Ahh shit, I don't believe this
Some niggaz that I fucked with tryin to pull a twist
But ain't that much twistin in existance
And this is how you show me love
It shows me exactly what money's capable of
Now is it that expenses that make you wanna catch me slippin
And pay a visit, cause this is, for all my homies
(All my homies) for jackers only
Come twist, to the fools in L.A. that know me
I'm back with the fifth of Henn
Kurupt and Dat Nigga Daz on the mash again

Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality (reality)
There's nowhere for me to hide from reality (reality)

I give it to you like it is, got no time for no games
In the world of madness, will my composure be the same
Will my friends be around when they rush me in the ground
A lost soul lost forever, never ever to be found
Life ain't what it seems, for the niggaz full of schemes
On the hood full of cash don't wanna blast for the green
These six bitches wanna get a nigga caught up
For what, a simple nut, a simple fuck

Daily it enhances the penetentiary chances
To survive in nineteen ninety-five
So I got nineteen ninety-five ways
To survive nowadays
Time and time again, I bust a rhyme again
Cause I'ma get in deeper shit if I convert to crime again
Out to mentally convert me, the same niggaz out to hurt me
It irks me, strenuous controversy
What's next on the list to complete
After all this shit that popped off on the street
And all eyes on me, but I won't change sides
Cause what I represent I represent til I die (til I die)
It's time for me, to grab a tall glass of (Hennesey, Hennesey)

Ya see my ways is to phase all them niggaz that try me
Leave em layin stiff if they ain't on IV's (beep, beep)
I beez the hardest, regardless fool
Livin life day and night stayin hard and cruel
Keep my cool, until my mood abruptly switch
Then I'm on a niggaz ass like bumpy zits (that's right)
It's no remorse when you cross my course
I'm not a hunter, but take a nigga out for sports
Don't resorts, to thinkin you could get with this
Or you will be a eulogy if you insist to diss
Mista Tray Dee, from L.O.N.G.
B.E.A.C.H., where the hardest gangstas be
Twenty-first was the worstest turf on the earth
Yet I feel I was meant to represent from birth
Til I die, you wonder why it ain't no secret
Motherfuckers best be in love with this G shit

Now there's, nowhere, for me, to turn
Nowhere for me to hide from reality 
Nowhere for me to hide from reality
Nowhere for me to hide from reality",Reality,1995

On a mission, fo' deep, Dogg Pound do or die 

[Daz] 

Now if you see me mobbin down the street what would you think (not) 

Realizing that I'm surviving off instinct 

What makes my mind click to perfect timing 

For me to twist shit switchin bullshit the fuck up like The Shining 

Cause I'm in my own zone, alone look down 

You think you saw but death is all round like a ghost town 

Perhaps you, know I axe you 

Fool if I have to, can you comprehend or adapt to

[Daz] 

Now I'm Dat Nigga Daz, everywhere I roll I'm set to blast 

The way to success is elevating too fast

And I could fuck your bitch after I bust just one rhyme 

All we do is smoke weed and get blitzed 

And kick that motherfuckin gangsta shit 

(Say what say what say what say what say what?) 

Kick that motherfuckin gangsta shit 

[Kurupt] 

Well I see myself on top, by the age of twenty-two 

or will I drop, a fallen star that has been forgotten not 

In the past, I mainly hustled for the cash 

surprised to see that nigga rise up on that ass 

Anybody killa, do or die if I have to 

On deck, twenty-four seven and blastin if I have to 

I live my life I done swore to courtin trigger long 

Who would stop the movement why I journied so far 

From the danger that lurks, from the one that's out doin dirt 

Step to modify this and vanish away from this Earth 

Beyond the heartbreaks and heartaches, rest in peace 

Riders died death is unexplainable when you die

Tha Dogg Pound,"Ahhhhhwww shit, fuck! 

It's a brand new day in the hood 
It's money to make, and I'm doin bad and it ain't lookin good 
It's all about the you know what everywhere that I roll 
And never leave emptyhanded without packin my chrome 
If it's on it's on, I put down my gangsta hand 
Show and prove and be gat, put the jack down a chance 
See I can put down like this, and you don't know why 
Niggaz always would try, but soon they all just die 
How they come up like I, would put my biz in the street 
I'd like to say is that the jack made my life complete 
Fifty-four thousand the cash he left cheesed and stitched 
But it still ain't enough, so what can I plot next? 
An armored truck'd be fine, as I come up from behind 
Grab 7 bags and fled, not wastin no time 
Coppers tailin my ass, breathin hard on my back 
Now my biz in the corner as I aband' the 'Llac 
Grab the satchel full of money brother Star crib 
I throw the money on the table say 'be back in a bit' 
I caught the biggest dope sack, I got my hood sewed up 
Now everybody bought to make the bomb soaked uncut 
Ridin', slipin' and slidin' 
Ran out a door my situation's back where I left 
A voice quietly tellin me -- you got to come up on some bread 
Don't get twisted for shit, see I be mashin on my own mission 
Never dreamin or wishin the money that I'm missin 
I heard some, niggaz doubt clockin rakin in all the dough 
And since I'm doin bad I gotta jack for they dough 
Called my partners in crime, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and Style 
True soldiers from the Dogg Pound, puttin it down 
Kick the door in with the gauge and fo'-fo' (don't move) 
Blast a couple of niggaz as I style with all the dough 
Five pounds of coke, two pounds of ? 
Now we baggin it up, and smokin all night long 
I want to trip, then I didn't have no chip 
And my pockets be short, and I started to trip 
To maintain with no problem stopped by my bitch house 
She was poppin with them sales I don't play that shit (bitch!) 
And sold five hundred in cavi barely happy today 
Feelin knockin rowdy and my homey had to say 

Well I got me a plot on the Westside on the town 
With some mark ass niggaz from the other side (yeah let's put it down) 
Now Dogg Pound Gangstaz true indeed we see 
The layout down, as we proceed 
Two in the front, three in the back, about to make niggaz collapse 
Cocked back the strap two minutes before the jack 
Takes place now we face to face and I'm in the mood 
For a murder, so I'm all for the do low and you know 
The chances, advances stages 
Gauges and three-eighties, crazy, nigga shady 
To my lady, what I'm a do is mine for my loot 
With the homies mash on the massion about quarter to two 
When we arrive, I be the first nigga to dip 
Straight to the front door and intention's to straight trip 
I gotta make my grip and I made my grip with the quickness 
Niggaz here to lick and got paid, bitch 
Riding, slipping and sliding 
I don't trust a bitch, so fuck a bitch

Tha Dogg Pound,"Have you ever seen... sooo much style?
We bout to do it a little somethin like this
'Cause it's Dogg Pound on mines, you know what I'm sayin?
(And you don't stop)
Fuck all your motherfuckers
(And you don't quit)
And umm... for some strange reason
(And you don't stop)
Niggaz like to duplicate
(And you don't quit)
(And you don't stop)
Transformin ass side bustas, Daz
(And you don't quit)

Come get at me, and play get back
The plots, concoct thoughts on DAT, can you counteract?
I'm openin my eyes, and my thoughs a blink
(But yet and still) there's no ideal what these thoughts contain
All alone (like) like no else around
In the area (say what) runnin shit from here to Siberia
Now is this a jack?

Nigga yes it is
'Cause I'm a Young Gun like Emilio Estevez

And dreaded, how you get shredded like paper
Tryin to intrude on the caper, who the hell can relate ta
That, automatic straps that's supposed to
Be hittin new clothes and expose
Knows, not, who to step to
This fool select to get his whole jock connect too
I select too so motherfucker bow down
Niggaz swear the Pound got so much style

So many styles
So many styles
So many styles

So many styles
So many styles
So many styles

So many styles
So many styles
So many styles

So many styles
So many styles
So many styles

Now have you ever seen me? Seen meaning saw
Niggaz running up in me murdering em all
My composure, stays above sixty degrees before
I enter in a circle and start maraudin MC's
The hysteria starts, multiplied two times
Supplied by the vibes, here's a run wild style
They can't match, in the back of my vocab batch
If you come in and take the stash nigga I'll start from scratch
So enter in my zone, I refuse to be dethroned
I got a microphone I had to kill and murder to own
From the bottom to the top and when you stare in my eyes
Emotionless shit registers in my mind when I get high
The darkest secrets, keep it untold
When it's revealed the Amityville mirage will unfold
Take flight, I ignite like C dash 4
With Daz I blow the shit the fuck up like the last world war
My creations, mental invasions
Thoughts that's able to annihilate generations, with so much style

So many styles
So many styles
So many styles

So many styles
So many styles
So many styles

So many styles

So many styles

Now let me take a second, for Dat Nigga Daz
To amaze with the ways to catch snap bones, let alone
Fuck up the scene, drop bombs upon the microphone
How can you see me when I'm already high and blown
To the fullest, Kurupt pull the MC's card
Now the Pound is blessed, like dove
I'm a Dogg, we gotta get paid, we gotta get paid

Every single day our shit is gettin played
So conclusively is the conclusion
The art of illusion
Niggaz step in the midst of confusion
How can you see what can't be viewed?
DPG has the ability to end a whole feud
So forget it, you're feelin lyrically energetic
So I sentence you to death by use of poetics
That's my realm, so don't even try to explore it
Niggaz tried and wonder why they lost they whole life for it

Niggaz don't realize what's with the Pound
Blueberry smokes clears the town when me and Kurupt puts it down
From the shoulders we be sling with the straps, we be jumpin
No suggestions needed when my Mac-90 start dumpin
Let me explain (whassup) niggaz don't know what time it is
I ain't even tryin to make friends
Fuck the bullshit the idiotic type bullshit
That you be stressin, let me get to the lesson
Peep me out, now you know
Ninety-four's the year now we fuck up hoes
Ninety-five we survive everyday
And what they say (we got styles)",Sooo Much Style,1995

Yeah 
Nobody pour out the eggnog and Hennessey 
Hahaha 
(Merry Christmas) 

Daz: 
(I wish I had love) 
This goes out to all my homeboys out there locked down 
(I wish I had love) 
I said I was remembering 
(I wish I had love) 
Throughout my life as a child 
My mama covered me with blessings 
Thanking God for another day 
Bringin' love and the presents 
But who cares about us homeless people? 
God do (God do) 
Don't be stingy, give a little 
Cause He love you (He love you) 
It's been a long time coming could say 
For this day 
Fulfilling dreams is the kid 
For the Christmas that I never enjoyed a year 
Spread love to my homeboys locked down in the pen 
Spread love to my homies that passed that I won't see again 
Enemies are friends 
It's Christmas time let us join hands 
Every woman, every man, across every land 
What's the solution for your 9-7 resolution? 
Is it love or hate 
Time's running out on the youth 

Kurupt: 
I'm in the middle 
In the rapture 
In the mixture 
Clear as daylight 
It's painted clearer than a picture 
I get my focus like a lens 
I start visionin' all my friends, mansions and ends 
Now when I was eighteen 
It would seem 
Thoughts of a teen wouldn't prevail 
But, I'm thinkin', oh well 
That's life 
And I'm a be a G (that's right) 
But for what I see 
The war's closer to me 
Wanted to be what I be 
Have what I have 
Write what I write 
With my pen and my pad 
Ain't nobody want to take what I make 
(That's on me) 
And don't nobody make what I make 
(That's on me) 
.38 covered with the chrome plate 
(That's on me) 
Realize, open your eyes 
Who's the real homies now? 

Daz: 
I wish I had love (2x) 
Growing up all alone, I wish I had love 
Every Christmas without a gift, I wish I had love 
I give love to all my homies, wish they had love 
Every day upon on the block, I wish I had love 
I wish I had love (2x) 
(Say what, say what) 
Now as I lay myself to sleep at night 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
So I can try to do right 
There's no one else that I can turn to 
I'm asking a favor, oh, just this once 
Oh, Jesus Christ, Lord I'm asking you 
Please help me out cause this my last days 
Cause if I die today I'm going to hell 
And I'd lead the way 
That I want to live my life, see 
I'm having a few simple problems 
And good one who could help me 
I've done a lot of crazy things in my day 
Being Mr. Scrooge on Christmas 
Out there really trying to get paid 
Now I know that was the wrong move 
Please forgive me for my sins 
And that's what I'm asking you 
I read the bible to keep the tune of what you say 
But this the first time in nineteen years that I ever prayed 
To be straight up and be serious 
I believe in you, God 
My mom says you work miracles 

Kurupt: 
I came from a small city called Philly 
My cousin Brian just passed 
The homie Kel-L just passed 
Time's movin' too fast 
I wonder will I last 
Glory in the world 
With less drugs and cash 
And I'm caught up 
But this ain't the way I was brought up 
Now I have doubts 
What's that all about? 
Now we smoke weed 
Now we get high 
And I don't have answers when my momma asks why 
Why, why, why? 
Why do I do what I do when I 
Feel kind of low and I'm on top of the sky 
I'm my own enemy 
With no energy to try 
I stopped along the middle of the trail 
Waiting to inhale and exhale 
Instead of waiting to excel 
Now, when I was eighteen 
It would seem 
Thoughts of a teen wouldn't prevail 
But, I'm thinking, oh well 
I wish I had love (5x) 

Daz: 
I wish I had love 
All the needy kids alive, wish they had love 
All the kids with disease, wish they had love 
To all the bums on my corner, wish they had love 
To the whole worldwide, I wish we had love 
Wish I had love (2x) 
And this goes out to the world, both sides 
Death Row wants to say, ""Merry Christmas"" 
And we out

It's time for chillin', you know what I mean 

Daz: 
Not killin' 
So let's make it to see '98 
And to all my homeboys in the pen (all the homies) 
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 
And we out 
And we see you when you get out",I Wish,1996
Tha Dogg Pound,"It's just another day in the hood for Kurupt, yeah, that's me 

Got schooled by Snoop in a black Cherokee 

Daz in the back, Warren G. in the front 

Nice sack of chronic with some gin in a cup 

Back up I stack up the weed 

Tha Pound and the Row is my only friends 

If you talk shit, I hit you hard as I can 

You talk shit once but never again 



Well, I'm back with the bubonic chronic sack for that ass 

So all my doggs pack the back, laced his ass 

To the fullest feeling I'm feelin you never could feel 

While your mind is comin where your body is chill 

As I mob with tha pound and my nigga Nate Dogg 

Not flaggin, not saggin, but havin a ball 

Yo, saw y'all motherfuckers want to see like doggs 

want to be like doggs, but can't compare to doggs 



It's like one to the two, two to the three 

K to the you-are-you-P-T 

In fact, I steps with a tech in the back 

In the hood, ain't got no love, so I packs a strap 



And I once knew a nigga named Dr. Dre 

He was a baller from the motherfucking CPT(a baller from the CPT) 

He hooked up with the niggas from the LBC 

And now they fuckin up the whole rap industry 



Well, check it out, and peep game on the one they call Dat Nigga Daz 

An OG straight puttin it down for the Eastside(right) 

But this is just a dove sack of dope 

So till yo ass dopes this mo 

Now, you can't see my mothafuckin homies from the CPT 

And you can't see my mothafuckin doggs from the LBC 



Check this flow, Hoover ain't the word to describe me, nigga 

Remember, I'm murderin niggas as a hobby 

Bodies get battered for fuckin with the best dogg dump 

With the tech-n-terror to fuckin chest start 

Do I give a fuck (hell no) I'm a locc nigga 

Who you tryin to provoke(nigga) step up, get smoked nigga 

Get the strap in the back I'm rollin and a bumpin 

Niggas talk shit I won't write and start dumpin 

Uh, who play the role like the G's 

Punk ass middle fuckin mark niggas, please 

Murder in the first degree 

I step with a tech, burst and flee 

You'll find none worst than me 

See, motherfuckers murdered and mangled, strangled 

Our bitches like a bangled 

Take ya from a whole different angle 

Bitches, I'm never sympin, You'll see me pimpin 

I step the clip in, bust a cap 

Watch them fall flat on they back 

Like this and like that from an automatic strap 

So for tryin the techno 

Respect I gets wrecked with a glock 

And it just don't stop 

I check every nigga known that's tryin to check me 

I wreck microphones verbally, respect me 

I'm off to the sto(re) to get me a fo(ur) 

Oh, so I'm headed out the door 



Now as I roll with Kurupt and my cousin Eastwood 

On a mission up to no good 

We don't love you bitch 

After we finish diggin 

Tha Pound's about that dollar and takin no shit 

>From the busta ass niggas, Bell it out shit 

Trick, recognize game when it slaps your face 

See I ain't no fzzzake, I take you to the next stzzzage 

One time can't trzzzace, now why you punk twice 



Now, you've been sleeping on the desk for a long time 

Waitin for the nigga to come bust a dogg rhyme 

So motherfuckers throw your hands in the air 

And get your proper groove on like you don't care 



See I don't love them hoes 

I like a butta nose 

Keep my mind on my money, that's just how my money flows 

And so 

How, I thought you knew, but now you know

Watch it!Watch it!
Daz is coming and there'll be no more waiting
Watch it! Watch it!
Kurupt is coming and there'll be no more waiting
Watch it!Watch it!
Doggystyle is coming and there'll be no more waiting
You might be shooting up close with the Itial ever lose respecting

[Kurupt]
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Thinking many plots blossoms how amny times?
I'm sedated my ""conscriptiated"" from beginning 
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my locs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach
To my bulls out in Philly cause all they smoke is phillies
Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in Darby tip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catching cases,robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact

[Daz]
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

[Daz & Bad Azz]
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself
Put em to rest,confess nevertheless
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat
Any MC trying to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre
In '96,with a different approach I'm shit
I got the flavor and I'm major,bust the ass
Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us
Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I bet ya I won't let ya escape
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, staying true
Demanding my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock, gat, gun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it
With the every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stomping, stepping with my projectile weapon

Whats up ""Jex"" so's eject the hum
When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must!If I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeating and deleting elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringing drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, something up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs 
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as ""bombing ya"",suffer from insomnia
And I'm a gonna be coming for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)

Bitch! (Bitch!)
I come through with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch
The riviera ever skaty, my team ya's the shit
Fifteen's humping, dropped the top, she moaned
counting my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss
In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side
We high, blazing like crazy, we don't know why
feeling good as fuck on a hot ass day
and it's a pujam right around the way
Niggas got hos but ladies in the world
they want to play wit their minds like little girls
I twirled my fingers in the air
rubbed my fingers through my hair
Red bones to black bones
dark bows to red bows
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
but I play hos like plenty-leany cause I get greedy
It's all about game 'cause when the game
is hard to maintain for so long, man
From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma
Tonight ""warning the award is"" from Mississippi, I know ya
hold the key to unlock the door
From long clothes she rolls with gold things we riding for sure
So tell me how much money can one player make? (make)
and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (you know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)

I was off in Vallejo
pulling hos like Idaho potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
being from where I be, DPG
It's manifico
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico
mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
and let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone the place that I call home
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room
Picture me ay
entrepreneur with my nigga D-A
Rockin tours and we still young boys
They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas
She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
That's right
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G
Hey girl, what's your name? Ya want to go a couple rounds with me
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy

[Warren G & Snoop Dogg]
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound
'cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you
Gimme a chance and I'ma break you
down to the very last compound
with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos
I bust a brand new ho in every video
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow
I pass a ho to my kinfolk
and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi
then turn on some Snoopy and, heat up jacuzzi
and later on I might just turn on a movie
so you can re-groupie and redo me just for Snoopy

Of the big chronic spliff then I take a hit 
It's like give it up, on the jack move tip 
'Cause after bass thumps you can feel the beat 

You dropped your car down, and disappear in the street 
Because a night rapper, tried to steal the funk 
But the buck stop here, 'cause I'ma let you know 
No swingin, no knuckles, strictly M.O. 

'Cause as I rush, crush bust, and dust 
A sucker new jack, with no if's and's or but's 
You can roll with the sucker ducks or roll with us 
I push the Coupe (I stole a Benz) You roll with us 

Get out the way homey, and prepare to bust 
But in the act of war, if he refuse to let up 
You be the wannabe, gonna be, soon to be whatever

And when ya come to Inglewood I'm a front you a sack
So we can grind and get away with the cash like a caper

And everything I make, fuck around and be a single
From the who banging hit, to the yes, yes, y'alls
Now all down my halls, got plaques on my walls
We might slow the roll, sit back and still kick it
But the shit don't stop till we hit a meal ticked

My heat sends heat strokes, my scraps put the senorita
Make niggaz choke like inhalin, end up the smoke
So take one tote off the automatic I got stashed in my coat
Under pressure, I come to test ya, extra
Holdin every rough texture, rough rhymin texture
Expect a, next a, hittin balls to hard balls some check ya
The romantic buildin is the beginnin of ya destiny
Destined to fall, praise to me and D-A-Z

Don't try to battle me, I cause fatalities
And this is how it is when the microphone put to torture
MC's done tried to step but I caught ya
I'm like a sorcerer, magical with rhymes
I'm one of a kind, my lines too inclined for your mind
And that's the way it is, you can't see me so don't even try
I wonder why MC's done tried to step in and they died
Now I be that MC, you can't see that
Lyricist that breaks MC's backs
Matter of a fact that ain't the way you should do it
This is how it is in showbiz
I know this MC can't even get close
Cause I rock shit from the west to the east coast

Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
Kurupt tell me, why they wanna fuck
Now I'm rollin in the fast lane tryin to find the right lane
I'm spittin game like big pimpin is my name
I need a flame, so I can get this shit lit
Its snoop dogg, I'm bout to drop me a hit
I got my nigga named kingpin to the right
And we plan on smoking all night
And when we through my nigga named priest gon increase the peace
Blaze up another sack, get your kakies creased
Cause its on and poppin, ain't no stopping

And um, we got a fat sack of blueberries, its scary
My brother jerry told me one day
He said snoop when you reach the top will you please blaze a J
For me and my homie J d-o-g, who's in the penitentiary but see

So motherfuckin back off or jack off for my smoke, smoke, smoke

Somebody tell me Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
They say no to dope, and ugh to drugs
But motherfuck that I'm a motherfuckin thug nigga

Been had hoe's, been havin chips
Spit out gangsta shit like haa chooo

Tha relatives, how gangsta is that
Half my life blowin do do wit a strap in my lap
Just goin out the ills and its hurtin niggaz
Kickin niggaz door down and searchin niggaz
In the fence for a week and its perkin niggaz
You niggaz ain't some gangstaz you some working niggaz
Ain't no mo silent niggaz
My prediction, 2004 there's gon be hoes and snitchin niggaz
Or peepin niggaz out the barrel of a 40
Hood on hood crime, homies killing homies

?? to harlem, chips flippin we ballin
Ain't nuttin better than being young gangsta and ballin
Blowed outta mind, probably be the high some more
Master money marna for the law

Mystica holders with pistolas and purple morta
Americas finest find me north of tha border
Please, no seeds, break bread cost an awful lot
Chay flag on a borca, slide in croca's
Splitters or the swishers, twisters, hundred sport cars
This for big tony, homey in the yinta

",Party at My House,2001

But I got something to tell you
Listen

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (You remind me)

Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh 
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you, no no
You remind me of a girl that I once knew

My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in

I fixed me some food, then go the hell out

I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)

Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body",Big Pimpin' [Live],2005

Nah, you can't even fade me
I fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady","New York, New York",2005
Tha Dogg Pound,"Yeah, back up in yo ass with a twenty sack
Don't wanna fuck with me
(Dogg Pound gangstaz)
We do it like that
Motherfuckers out there be like, takin' our styles
Be trying to do they own little dissing
But they can't do it, you know, so we gonna, do it like this
Sit back relax and get a cool one

Have you ever heard of a slughter? I oughta start dippin'
Sippin' on that S T get's me to trippin'
I don't slips, I bangs with that mad ass Dogg Pound gang
It's a DPG thang, Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me, let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental

I subdue and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin'
Niggaz collapse and when the straps is clickin'
Look, this is how it's done nigga
(One, two, three)
I grab my strap, you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick

Shit, a motherfucker betta recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone

Ever since I was bown, not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin' styles minute after minute
But soon as you did it I smelled the niggaz shitted

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay
Every single day in the LBC
Cruisin' through the East side, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' bustin' free styles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place?
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck wit' my crew

I see all these niggaz tryin' to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast and then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggaz layin' low on the East Coast
And the question is asked

Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him 'em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knockout and every nigga down with him
'cause I'm a natural born killer
And I steal a half, motherfucker 'cause it's like that

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference 'cause it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence

For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, 'cause niggaz talk shit

Now if a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive?
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive?
Probably not, you'd probably let your glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowin' in the breeze
(Flowin')

Now what would you do?
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
'cause it messes up the flow to the real fillings why'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy

In the way like a stray dog
Trying to climb, every bitch on his arm
Cock-blockers, come in every color
Even blue, now this is true
Trying to fuck your woman and even you
Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker?

What would you do? Mmm
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do?
If you could get with me and my crew

The weak ones stick and move
What would you do if you could get with my crew?
Why don't you tell me what?
Tell me what you would do if you could get with
The weak ones stick and move

What would you do if you could get with my crew?
Me and my crew, with me and my crew
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do, if you could get with my crew?

What would you, what would you do
If you could get with the Dogg Pound?
What would you do?
Would you get caught with your pants down?

Dangerous and vital to all my rivals 
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys 
To the average motherfucker's minds these days 
I'm all ready to put work in 
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin' 
Give a fuck, what's your name, what you claim 
Or why you came, motherfucker don't explain 
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply 
Layin' hoes lifes empty, the invincible MC 

[Chorus One]
[Chorus Two: Snoop]
Too much, I serve too many people, too much 
It's too much, I serve too many people 
And when I finish servin' ain't gon' be no sequel 

[Chorus One and Two]

[Verse Two: Kurupt]
Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees 
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless 
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me 
So how the fuck you inherit my style? 
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny 
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why 
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones 
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis 
Gets me into verbally vindictive 
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence 
Catch me in the pitch black path 
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental 
Till I hear an instrumental 
And detrimental verbals get to spittin' 
The highest in intellect, try connectin' with the written 
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen 
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war 
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo' 
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow 
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do' 
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!) 
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally 
Bore your whole molecular, structure 
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix 
Hittin MC's like picks the deadliest lyricist 

[Chorus One and Two:Repeat x2]

[Kurupt] 
We live, tonight I serve two thousand MC's 
We live, cause can't none fuck with the DPG'z 

[Daz] 
We live (baby) because tonight I serve two thousand MC's 
We live (baby) none can fuck with the DPG'z 

[Snoop] 
DPGC, ba-by 
ABC the DPG'z 
Ba-by

[Verse Three: Kurupt]
Everyday, I bust rhymes and recite 
In ways that make MC's stop in daylight 
I'm the deadlies MC you want to see on the streets 
Invincibility is what makes me complete, compete 
Nah you can't even fade me 
I fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady",New York [DVD],2006
Tha Dogg Pound,"[Chorus]
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love

[Kurupt]
The bitch tried to act like I didn't know her
So I just ignored her, placed a order with her friend
And after her friend was rollin', she was all in
I ain't mad at ya, upset, I ain't trippin'
Just make sure before I put my dick in
Your mouth, you tell me how it feels
To get dick from a nigga that's real
I knew all along you wanted to do it to me
And I knew your homegirl was in that cooch
She just smiled and giggled
Then she ate my balls off like Halls and Skittles
(Ah shit) Now this was the bomb
Cause her homegirl over there watchin' it all
My homegirl came over and we had a ball
One was eatin' the other while I was beatin' the walls

[Chorus]
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love

[Too $hort]
I was with these two hoes last night
They was hooked on my dick like a glass pipe
They ate each other out, again and again
Everytime they took a break I was stickin' it in
And when I took it out, put my dick in her mouth
Looked down, the other bitch was eatin' her out
And that's how it be, and now ya see
It's just that everyday player lifestyle to me
Too $hort baby, you know I'll never treat a bitch like a lady
You know I never stopped pimpin' since the '80s
And I never will, I'm the player you can't play me
These niggaz be hoe-less, and they know this
On the money real players stay focused
It's all game ain't no hocus pocus
Me and Daz in Miami bout to take yo' bitch

[Chorus]
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love

[Daz Dillinger]
Cheap hoes, I took a flick of her tits and her hips
And her lips and the click and her body was the shit (god damn!)
We engaged in a threesome, she wanted some freedom
So we decided to freak it, she was black and Belizean
Firm body, she was a hottie fresh outta New York
With a girl from Shreveport, was fine of course
We took a hot bath, we giggled and laughed
Plus I tickled that ass and she gave me some head
While you do me and you do her
Whatever occur we shall keep between us
And you do her, and I'll watch you
And kiss and just start freakin'
We did it big - we smoked, we drank, that's how we live
She 24 without no kids (Break the bitch)
Yeah, she did it like this and like that
(Break that bitch and take that cash, she just a beotch!)

[Chorus] - X 2
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy

Check this out baby girl
There's a few things I wanna explain to you, ya know
Now if you gon' be with me we gotta vibe together
Now that word means a whole lot to me
Now what I mean by that, it's simple as this
You gotta open up your head
Matter of fact, open up your mind
And let me put my head inside of your head
So you can think like me
And move like me and vibe like me
You know what I'm talkin' bout?

You can smoke, you can roll
You can move, you can groove
You can drink, you can ride
You can vibe with a pimp
You can bounce, you can tip
You can slip, you can ride
You can shake, you can slide
You can vibe with a pimp

[Kurupt]
You can vibe with a pimp, ride with a pimp
Dip when I dip, come by my crib
Post with a playa, let me show you what it is
I don't really want too much mama, just a little bit
I came to give you want you want mama, wait a little bit
Got this place I gotta get to, I'ma tell you what it is
You can roll, you can post, we can ride up on the coast
Just post with your folks, just vibe with a pimp
See what I see, she said I'm G'd up, I said I'm guilty
Now run up in the spot girl and throw on somethin' silky
Bad to the bone, pure redbone
Vibe with a playa, and show me what you're made of
Ridin' with the all chrome D's on the Brougham
Out to get the paper, sparklin' like my Dana's
Wide with the all gold hundred-spokes on
G'd as I wanna be, can't you see what I see?

C'mon and ride with a gangsta mack
Pimp, dip, slide with this
C'mon Snoop git, blaze that shit
We got these hoes mesmerized
Hypnotized, blowin' they mind
A real nigga like this hard to find
Fuck a smile, give me some money bitch, give it to daddy
In a 645 to a '7-trey Caddy
Got 'em ringin' my phone, they won't leave me alone
Stand on it just like a rock, I'll break 'em hard as a stone
Conversation, illustration, plus a whole lot of patience
I'll have yo' bitch ass sittin' at the bus station
It's pimpin', my money hold me down, I ain't limpin'
Everything I got is on these motherfuckin' bitches
I can gorilla and smooth mack her, dick will slap her
Professionalism, bitch this ain't no actor
Realer than real, it's hard in the field
You got to have skills to pay a pimp's bills

My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a fuck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body",Big Pimpin',2009

Now my rhymes, are as potent as pipebombs
It takes time to concoct rhymes like mines
Like land mines, all set to explode
Microphones, all set to unload
So, watch the means, watch the zone
I made it different with a million dead MC microphones
And they all wanted back by their peeps
Sleep if you dare, cause death catch niggaz when they sleep
Beware of the consequences, it's senseless
To face a prosecuted life or death MC sentence
Travel through your inner thoughts
Just to vision how far I can get, explore to the inner core
And ain't stopped yet, continue the journey
Cause all that shit you kick just don't concern me
You can't U-turn me, back... to... reality... where niggaz pack straps
And they mentality react so violently to leave MC's breathin silently
With hollow point talons for the violence
Ain't no harmin me, ain't got no love for no hoes in harmony
It's easy to find MC's to execute
Chances of survival too small to compute
Recognize, like this was Samuel Sneed
I grip the microphone continue with my devilish deeds
'Cause all I see, in my M-I-N-D
Is D-P-G, for L-I-F-E
And all I see, on the M-I-C
Is another mangled MC opposin me
Supposed to be, regulatin in this rap era
Made one error up against the microphone terror
It takes two to tangle
I told Daz don't worry like Keith Murray I'ma strangle
MC's, with the microphone cord
You don't faze, your thoughts been invaded and explored
I know the ins and the outs to you buddy
I know where you live, and how you make your money
I came to violate you, desicrate you, I create two
Murderous scenes, can you relate to

(I was raised in the hood)
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can't take the hood up outta me, you dig

Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins
Yet I'm stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it every time, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh wee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin' in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city when I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I'm going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin' like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block

I catch a nigga slippin' like moss

It's 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitch I'm rollin'

Tha Doggfather,"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big Turkish wole with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flaunting and won't it speaking
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb with the beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down wit his starks untied
And a blue and gray cap that said the east-side
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nothing but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass transform wit finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at the V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offering him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussing

the vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
after getting rejected, I ain't running upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?'  Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-see straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listening to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
""We used to see Daz, back in the day""
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)

The black car drive by then you get capped on

But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got

Damn cause this spot's gettin hot
I can't trust the paremedics or them crooked ass cops
The closest nigga to you would do you and try to screw you
Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you
And he could be the same nigga the switch
Playin all one minute but he really is a bitch
Now watch out for the twist
Here come them niggaz that was with you but they out to get rich
But you thought them niggaz would never do that
Until they came back strapped with them rat-tat-tat-tats
And it always ends up fucked up
When the innocent die it'll have yo brain stuck
It'll have yo brains stuck shit outta luck cause I'm havin bad luck
Fucked up in my younger days
Shit I'll bang you with deuces and hang you with trays
A few days back one of homies got rugged out
Damn shame all the brothers seem drugged out
One of seeds bust a bottle over the bizis head
Say it's yo fault that the otha bizis layin dead
But it's a fact if you pack nigga bust back
Neva run throw our gun unless you fall rat
Hoo wooda said that it wooda helped anyway
Wit mo guns niggaz sinnin for another day
Damn cause this spots gittin hot
Damn cause this spots gittin hot
Shits gittin hectik bustin threw my windo
Think it was my homies fucked up can't really call it do
If it was I'ma git him
He gunna hate it when it hit him
Damn cause this spot's gettin hot
I can't trust the paramedics or them crooked ass cops
The closest nigga to you wood do you and try to screw you
Backstab you in the back and act like he never knew you

Another day has come
How much longer will I run
I wanna have sum fun
Layin out in the sun
How much dirt have I done
My life has just begun
I sleep with my gun
My problems weigh a ton
( Tray-Dee )
I gots to say damn the program dun up and switched
Fool I used to run with and trusted snitched
Got one time on my block straight posted
Hopin that I slip but I dip and ghosted
Told my babymama it wus drama unfoldin
I kissed all my kids den commits to strollin
Wound uptown on a hot ass block
Checkin with some chickens gettin hot ass cock
Daily Tray-Dee'll loose pursuit
But deez ho's broke and don't look to cute
So I parlay to the hard ways of jackin
Fast came to cash but the mash was crackin
I didn't I was the one to be
Kickin summary of sum wen I let em slide up under me
But God as my witness
As a G I couldn't see Dee just goin out sensless
I stayed hard hit the yard
Pull niggaz hole cards
Had em runnin to the sarge
Jail house scars tell the part you played
Livin with a snitch jackin destined for the brake
It don't pay to go soft
Cause when we catch you slippin real niggas takin off motherfuckers
( Dee, Talkin )
And that's how we do it
Bitch ass niggaz
Out here tellin disrespectin the game
Fuckin up this realism we puttin down out here
You know what I'm sayin
Nigga need the cops to help em out

That's what my momma always told me

True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto

Banking off my gold chain

Darkness was paved

Then we've got it made

Money ain't everything dog, but I tell ya
If I didn't have it, i'd be labelled as a felon
So, as long as I breathe, I achieve
Keep god first in my life, I know that's right
And I prevail, whether I do or don't sell
It ain't about that, it's about giving back

Let a homie get his sang on, instead of his bang on

Be down, but I had to make a dash

On the grind no I rhyme nigga times is hard
Got jugs of water buried all across my yard
One time on my line tryin ta find a cause
Toss a nigga in the street and reach up under my balls
Guns cocked, mug shots, cell blocks and locked down
But I done made it too far to stop now
Results of a banger, to most I'ma danger
No hope for those who come to close to the chamber
Bitches lovin I'ma gangster so fuck it
No matta if I hafta I get at em in a bucket
Tuckin in my shirt and all that shit don't work
First look, say I'ma crook that did dirt for the turf
High talk, high walk, when I stalk the street
Gurantee who try to see me come across the feet
It's a eastside lifestyle, wild and foul
Goin out, puttin it down sayin fuck the trial
Aim is to be famous wit major loot

So rough, so tough

What is it? This for them, suckas
Nigga, I came from a long line of playas
That ain't scared of nar' one of y'all, motherfuckers
I see these niggas wanna see me catch a case and get struck out
But I'm laughin' 'bout to knock they ass the fuck out

Bitch, quit actin' like a stuck up clown
That's why yo raggety ass attitude is fucked up now
Suga Free, bitch swingin' on my dick sayin', wee
The pimpin' is crackin' so I feel like mackin' tonight
(Aight)

Now them seventy niggas? Thirty gon' hate us
That's why I play the role, keep control
And throw them off wit' these dirty gators
See time was torn

'cause if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit
I bought you somethin' too, what's mine is yours
But now you'd rather bring me down and see me fall
Walkin' wit my head down, straight, dependin' on y'all

The call me Honcho, I like to sparkle
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal
Am I a star? No, ya' in my car? No
My name is Soopafly, bitch so ya' all know

Now heffer don't act stupid, 'cause ya'know who I am
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn
I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram
I pimp across the land, better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram

Snoop Dogg told me that
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin' on this funky track
Bang ES, we givin' it up, got the bitches singin' the rest
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast
(So fast)
Fuck wit' us, I'll put a foot up yo ass

Collect calls from the pen so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jack up
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our dada's
And ask them niggas in the Source Awards
When I caught them while y'all was pacin', the homies
Was bringin' up situations, eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'

Yeah, it's the genius of the click
Known to sleep a nigga quick
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist

Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs

I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

It's a statement that I'm makin' and ain't takin' no backtalk
I'm blowin' niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough
The last thought you rappin' niggaz should think
Is you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat
On the streets over beef you don't compete with uno, you know
The general a criminal do low
Admit 'cause I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it
Niggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin'
By my presence I'm a answer to society's hate
A true rider with the mind, I pushed him outta his way
Fools petty and they ready steady comin' with bullshit
A full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick
A sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast
Motherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Now is the time
This is the place
To bang back the khakis with the church fat lace
West is the coast, east is the side
Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride
Money brings power, power brings respect
Disrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech
This is how it goes and that's how it's done
Eastside 2-1 in the land of the fun

[Tray Deee]
Niggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait
I came home straight from the pen to take your place
ain't no chase this paper comin' soon as I post up
And watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin' his dough up
Fuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up
Take the whole cut and he be sure negotiative
I'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike
Thug for life - come and catch the slug tonight
Insane mental frame feel no shame or pity
Since the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city
Trippin' gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat
Grab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep
This is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal
Kobe eatin' what he speakin' once he can't get the muzzle
Struggle hard for my title and intend to hold it
You want it? Then all invitations open

[Chorus]

[Tray Deee]
I take seven old be's put 'em in the street
Then that's seven more busta's who claim they got heat
And then it takes seven more see's before I start to reach
Then that's 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets
Tray Deee never do it easy fool so don't expect it
Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected
No question I'm all you ever thought that you was
Till you ran across the boss and now you coughin' up blood
Shoot first fools curse before they kick up dust
Clip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up
All they talkin' cause I'm chalkin' whole districts off
Since this loss a purple nigga's piss me off
Conflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched
All my comrades bomb back it's as sick as fuck
2-1 till I'm done never run from the turf
Check the badge boy we mash on run get it even worse

I used to tell lies, steal from your purse,

I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor

That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got

Better go around and when it come to you

Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal

Comin' through bitches 

I drink a lot of ale, smoke a lot of L's a day
Got kegs in my room and bales of hay
Twenty-five roaches piled in my ashtray
Some like it slow some live the fast way
All the ladies know I'm wild and nas-tay
I live the ""Rap Life"" like my nigga Tash say
I down the whole brew, never half way
I'm back and forth to the bar in the Likwid Cafe

[Repeat: x2]
Now put yo' bottles to yo' lips
When I sip, you sip, we sip, altogether now
Back, and, forth, to the bar y'all
Back, and, forth, to the bar y'all

They say one man's trash is the next man's treasure
Next man pain be the other man's pleasure
Whatever you want to drink ma we bought the bar out
Last cats to call out, who wan' fall out?
Worst case scenario walkin', I hate talkin'
Do the damn thing, let your dogs start barkin'
Embracin the bass (yeah) who keep you laced

Wherever my crew go, same old scenario
Takin' over every show, rockin' on the radio-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

It's Tha Liks you know our repertoire, we party y'all
We treat every day like it's fuckin' Mardi Gras (y'know)
Y'all done started somethin' you just can't finish
Ten years deep in this game called rap business
We takin' hip-hop back, it's gettin' unbearable
Y'all done disrespected the game somethin' terrible
My Likwid Crew shower you, with rhymes that's incomparable
Beats so ridiculous it just ain't fair to you
We act stupid off the tonic and whiskey
Smoke so much weed you might think I'm a hippie
In the club drunk with my nigga King Tipsy
Lookin' for some hoes that we can toss like frisbies
Bail through the club belligerent like, ""Bitch Please"" (damn)
Tab at the bar is already like six G's
Everywhere we go, I roll with the same old gang
Doin' the same old thang, again and again

[Chorus]

Niggas know (y'all niggas know) 
On your marks get wet, three vets is on the set
It's nine years in the game and we ain't lost a step yet
We still in full effect with drunk rhymes that make the world spin
(While you starin at me nigga) Nigga, I'm starin' at your girlfriend
Women see us out and think my click is too obnoxious
Cause we bail around the party like we off a couple notches

We off a couple vodkas, home girl, we Likwid niggas
Take the time to get to blow us, tell yo' friends come kick it with us
Ha ha, all jokes aside, we slide slippers
Money fallin' out my pocket like I robbed nine strippers
Tash is, ""Animal House"" like Jon Belushi
I'll be drinkin all the sake while you eatin' all the sushi (damn)
(Whattup nigga?) It's still the same situation
Tha Liks be gettin' head from the same bitch you datin'
Ratin us a 9'll be a waste of your time
We tens with big ends so let the games begin (y'know)

[Chorus]

Niggas know y'all niggas know 
Niggas know y'all niggas know 

Yeah, yeah!
Imperialistic without doubt, the King'll blast your character out
So stop playin with it, you fadin in it
I stay with it, let me present the crown sound
Constricted with the Likwid, the ticket round town
The wicked wild sound unleashed out the cage
Plus the Alkaholiks got the bar on stage
Get pissy, Tipsy got a baggy full of cavi
J-Ro put D's on the Mavi'
Swift got TV's in the Caddy
Tash kept it all factory
The Likwid far from tacky
Even if I step in the Sky Bar, K-Swiss and hard khakis
Y'all niggas better be happy, let me bubble

That's to ""Extinction Level Event"" these wack niggas offa this block
Me and Tha Alkaholiks havin a drink, watchin' y'all niggas get sick
Holdin ya stomachs 'til you earl in the sink
The type of dude I never put in my clicks, because you funny
And you be sittin' down with your legs crossed like a bitch
I be the foul mouth quick to toast y'all, so-called
Niggas who like to boast we let your bodies float along the coast y'all
This very given moment, opponent, niggas like you
Ain't allowed up in our circle 'cause we don't condone it
We love to microphone it, perhaps
What we gon' do instead is give y'all gutter beats and raw sewage raps
And for the last thing that I'ma make clear
That when we present watch your step when you be comin' round here

We-got-shit-that-make-y'all-wild-out
To bounce in the truck (Aye yo, get with the funk, y'know)

This world's tryin' to make me crack, but it still ain't broke me
I fall down and just rebound like Charles Oakley
Hoes be like all he wanna do is poke me
Bitch what you think I wanna do, the hokey pokey?
Her boyfriend Smokey said he was gonna smoke me
Her daddy crazy loc he tried to beat me and choke me
And she still want me, keep blowin' up my Noki'
Tryin' to provoke me to fall for okey-dokey
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
I'm just spittin' liquid in the middle of the pit
Turn it up a bit, burn it up and hit the bomb
I'm iller than Sadaam takin' Carrie's mom to the prom
Cool and calm, Macken-Ro, Likwid don
Bust rounds with Busta Rhymes, then I roll up, one
You got ice I got ice, but who nice on these mics?
(You motherfucker!)

[Chorus]

We out for justice so bust this it's Busta and the Alkies
niggas wanna know the secret but they just can't get it out me
So they talk that shit about me but to me that's never not
They pop that shit across the room while I down another shot
I smoke a hefty bag of doz and black out, and lose composure
Close my eyes and throw a bottle (I'm fuckin' up) this party over
I still got that flare so just stare from over there
Cause I'm so accurate with guns I put parts in niggas hair
So I declare war, Tha Liks, we fierce competitors
The feds be checkin' fo' us writin' letters to these editors like,
""Tha Liks is veterans, they straight from California
We ain't even give a fuck when they sprayed that beer on us"" like
{Rah raraow) Just like a Dungeon Dragon
Taggin' Tash up on the wall while my pants is saggin'
Draggin' niggas through the mud clear blood all through the club
The quickest way to show some love is let a nigga hit your bud

My dear my dear my dear
You do not know me but I know you very well
So let me tell you bout the feelings I have for you

Listen, it was a quarter past, one, the lights went, low
Everybody know the Likwid Crew's about to flow
At an Alkaholiks everybody go bananas
Niggas slammin in the pit, bitches poppin' off the cameras

Any mic you hand us Likwid niggas make us killers
So we rock the motherfucker now we back stage, illin'
Still in, my wet ass clothes, strikin' a pose
Niggas askin' who's ? nigga, mind yo' rolls

I'm peepin out the hoes turnin up a forty ounce
All y'all women y'all can stay but all y'all niggas gotta bounce
I looked across the room and seen this girl about to leave
Pretty face big titties weave hangin to her sleeve

Please believe I rushed her, Tash he on attack
Gave that bitch a oo-oop, the bitch looked back
I let her hit my cognac, she got buzzed and started wobblin'
I asked her what she do, she said videos and modelin'

[Chorus: x2]

You don't know me, I bone you send you home feelin' lonely
You always say, ""Defari, how come you never hold me? (How come)
How come we don't go out so I can be your best homie?""
'Cause I just want to FUCK, you too god damn nosey

Play your position, no games, no pretendin'
Don't act like you on top when you not badder than these women (nope)
Think you a Queen, when you really my ?
Always listen to you talk, but me, never sharing

And if I'm sharing never vital information

Aiyyo it's six million drinks to try, choose one
So you can catch a buzz while Likwid show you how it's done
Bouncin' off the walls is just my niggaz havin' fun
With all these weak niggaz, why the fuck'd we lose Pun?
Damn it's a trip to see the world twist around us
But Tha Alkaholik clique, a.k.a. the 40 downers
Gets twisty, twisty, yak and brews
Black Rob flows is ""Whoa!"", Tha Liks is like ""Whoo!""
Is there a doctor in the house cause somebody gonna need him
Tash fight for his right to party, I need my freedom
So I can drink in public without the cops eyin' me
F.B.I. spyin' me cause everybody buyin' me

I got drunk and got down with Tha Liks
But before I put it down all I need is a fix
Now bust a nut - I rhymes aways on different days
And everybody wonder how I stay so blazed
I'm like a sickness; I'm like a sickness but there is no cure
And when you hear my voice don't it sound so pure
Tha Alka-holiks know, come bust fo' sho'
So whether we together kickin' down the doors

From Lake Buteras to Paris generic rappers get embarrassed
We inherit b-boy Sermons just like Erick's
Liks been flowin' longer than your grandparent's marriage
Eatin' buzzed brownies more than Bugs eat carrots
Kick back in the 'llac like a horse and a carriage
Spittin' ""The Facts of Life"" more than Tudy and Ms. Garrett
When I'm runnin' my errands Dayton rims feel like Ferris

Get socked in your larynx, if yo' ass get careless

Aiyyo who stole the soul? I did cause I was desperate
Send a random note to Loud - I want a million for my next shit
I know you got the money Steve just reach into that grab bag
Then step back and watch me drop these ""Bombs On Baghdad""
Cause Tash rap melodical, drunk periodical
Niggas think they hot but I'm seein' they ain't got it though
I'm from L.A. you from Idaho, no skills you gotta go
Fo' albums deep, so y'all motherfuckers gotta know
We birds of a feather so we, smoke together
Tha Liks and Rocwilder gonna, choke whoever
Ain't in this motherfucker comin' raw dog style
Hold my drink Mr. Tan while I jump in the crowd

Excuse my gutter language, but fuck bein' famous
Robust for nameless don of rhymin' china chain less
Olde English ancient drive Chevy's with paint chips
I breathe herb, so they say my words is tainted
Let's take it back to ""Colors"" get your face painted 
With fat caps
I got more rhymes in my mind than you can fit in your backpacks
Go 'head, eat 'em up like snack packs
I stay busy like crack shacks
I like my hoes with the lickable toes
And the silver dollar nipples that be pokin' out the clothes
Now I suppose you want flows like MackinRo's
Cause you be standin on the stage at all our motherfuckin' shows
James Robinson, even my name is dominant
Lyrics astonishin' from the Likwid Conglomerate

",My System,2000
Tha Mexakinz," 

[Verse 1: Intellect]
Born on the fourth of february in seventy four, Capital I-Man
Acquarius surviving, survive till 95, a lot shit's changed
They're slowing, fastline, then that's the rain
It's insane, people want it, people flaunt it
They murdered with thugs, decided to bust a move on them
Or a matter of give or take and break burning elevation
Ignite the flight by higher learning, concerning
Granting you abilities like think  
Motions first reactions though instinct
Like blinks of an iron eagle in the cling, do or die
Survivor unknown how it seeps through my third eye
Mentality closed reality before clutch
Radar radius thus far it's too much
Be operating two-four/seven
Try to hit me with the next, I'll be ahead ten seconds

[Chorus]
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] In a blink, I listen to my first INSTINCT
When nothing feels fine
Pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT

[Verse 2: Intellect]
Woke up on a Saturday afternoon about two  
With the hangover trying to cut my view
I've got the remedy, damn fool, last night was the bomb
Out with the C.B. crew ALL NIGHT LONG!!!
At the party capacity packing
Everybody seem to be cool like that
Pass the J's as we blaze freestyling in a circle
MC's ripping skills till their faces turn purple
All 'cause their passionalities was in the beginning  
definitely in the house was THA MEXAKINZ
DJ knew what to play, music was thumping
Females in the house put you in the mood for humping
Around like Bobby and Brown with ""My Prerrogative"" to light up
The spliffs and blunts 'cause once it's how we lived
I admit it, I cranked it, overdid it  
Two thirty in the morning, something told me to quit it
Congregated, my crew done stepped out full of brew
Rolled up mi leño for the thirty minute cruise
Dropped me out by my house, now we in the present stage
Got today's newspaper, looking at the front page
""A Drive-By At Three In The Morning
Kills One"", at the same party that I felt the warning
That coulda been me or my homies on the headline
But I guess INSTINCT told me it wasn't bedtime

[Chorus 2]
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I listen to my first INSTINCT
When nothing feels fine
Pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT

[Verse 3: Intellect]
Well, of course tonight, it's the night I'm out with aggression
After what I read that led me to learn a lesson
So I grabbed my nine double M and extra clip
It can't be headline: ""Capital I-Man Just Slippped""
Failed out the avenue?  Gotta get my crew
Bumped the oldies, got reunited with the homies
No room for kharma deep in my aerostar bed
Swinging shit like my name was Tarzan and can't
Fumble, soon as we hit this jumble
Tree felt like ""Me was George Of The Jungle""
Cruising down the boulevard about the speed limit
Looking for schtookie thinking about digging in it
Wait a minute!
I think I smell bacon right behind me
Which reminds me, you can't trust a pig in the '90s
Try to find thee automobile stolen
I guess because I'm Mexakin and deep is how I'm rolling
In the rear view I see they run a make on my plates
Couldn't find shit in the Jett but I'mma stick to
Fuck with me seeing that I'm clean as a whistle
Except for the moment I'm high and got my pistol
From behind the sween accelerate right up
While they harrass us, luckily they roll right passed us
You never knew could this spot fills too hot with cops
Back to the hood, back to the block, 'cause!

[Chorus 3]
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I listen to my first instinct
When nothing feels fine
pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I listen to my first INSTINCT
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT
When nothing feels fine  
pop, pop, goes my nine

Tha Rayne,"Young cat got back, did a little bid
Now he hard, he buff,  he tough, doo rag and Timbs
Kinda hard to get a job back out on the block
Charge that to the game
Young girl she grew up in a rush
Had it bad, no dad, she don't know who to trust
Every man she ever loved only want to crush
Charge that to the game
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We've got love for y'all but y'all don't love us
So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
Prepaid cellies for local calls
Lil' don and divas up at the mall
Rockin' cornrow twist, that's how we roll
But don't hate on us, we're fabulous

They met, he said how she was a dime
So naive that she believed every single line
17, first time slipped up, 'bout to have a child
Charge that to the game
Was just us and mom, single family home
She did the best she could, did it all her own
Met a man but he won't raise a child that's not his own
Oh, no, oh, no, no
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We've got love for y'all but y'all don't love us
So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
Pre-pay cellulars for local calls
Lil dons and divas up at the malls
Rockin' cornrow twist, that's how we roll
But don't hate on us, we're fabulous
With all that we've got
And no matter whatever together we'll weather the storm
And meanwhile with all we got it might get rough, but
It's alright

Tha Realest,"Ah shit! 

Yeah 
Everywhere I go 
'Nough gunshot are firin' out the ghetto area seen? 
I hava watch my back 
Too much crack seen? 
Watch yourself 'cause 'nough homicide a gwan in de area 

I hear some niggas clockin' major on the other side of town 
Strictly slidin' for a proper come up to come around 
Called up the homies from way back, who dream of gettin' paid 
Then finally get paid with the amount of 80 G's 
6:30 layin' in cut, prepare to get ready 
Me and Ty grew up, mashin' to get our feddi 
Food stamps galore, kick in the door get on the floor 
Make sure my homies get away smooth with the dough 
A hardcore motherfucker raised up not knowin' 
Now my dream is just a dream we're sellin' dope and hoein'
Moms can't tell me shit, I make the rules that I live by 
In and out the house, late at night, and plus I got high 
The homies influenced me to be the G of all G's 
Perfectly innovated to all my homies 
Pull out the Riviera, plus I kick up dust 
Pull out the brain, pull out the thing, cock back and bust 
It's just some gangsta shit, goin down on the Eastside 
Some niggas who died and tried to who ride on mine 
Pull on the 7 Carter with the homey Flossy Floss 
He's the homey from the Beach who's known for takin off 
Pile up the bird then swerve, conversate on smoke and submerge 
Finger on the trigger, contemplatin' on a murder 
I mean, takin life 'for life, cause it's right 
Shit, niggas gotta do, to earn they stripes, straight merkin'

[Chorus: x2]
It's some gangsta shit, that's going down 
Homicide, straight murder/homicide 
It's some gangsta shit, here in this town 
Straight murder

Word on the street is that them D-P-G niggas shot they homeboy 
Now the only sound in the town is gunfire 
Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers 
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue 
Now forty-five, niggas bought em by the spot 
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot 
Niggas skied out quick, around the block who know we comin' back 
Post up early on the attack 
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain 
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge 
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him 
Cause he violated the rule of the streets 
Two redrums under my belt, it felt good bout to murder 
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker? 
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin' what I feel 
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin'
The enemy, can't see the hoes who try to get with me 
Understand where I'm comin' from the D-P to the G-the-see 
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped 
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips 
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thing 
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a 
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff 
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin 

[Chorus]

Check it out 
I heard niggas kickin' static makin' noise 
Cold hearted want to get it started with my boys 
Automatic toys to tangle with niggas for profit 
Got shit on lock down cause I lets the Glock spit 
Soon as D-A-Z hits me on my hip, talk about chips 
The game run heatin' them clips, the gaze kicks 
Automatic tech nine spits, I gotta 
Roll with the Pound that's the neighborhood of murder 
Am I the only motherfucker ridin'? 
Am I the only rider but I found a whole pound of niggas violent 
I got the big homey Ty money worldwide 
From Portland, Oregon L.A. to the N.Y. 
I'm bout to crash in your door, unload the double four 
Then stash it, then we blasted all we saw 
The fo'-fo', the fo' double sparkin'
The gang walkin' up your hood like nothin' but trouble 
We straight gangsta shit

On your life dere might be a oversight

To King Size, dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braile
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies

Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Yeah, save the narrative, you savin' it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin' it for karats
You wanna see how far I'm a go
How, much I'ma  spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me, c'mon

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
I'm a hustler baby (uh, Hov')
I just want you to know (Hov')
It aint where I been
But where I'm bout to go (Hov', Hov')
Now I just wanna love you (young Hova)
But be who I am (know you love me)
And with all this cash (mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

And I think it's funny you choose
Who's in progress of runnin' in place
We makin' rules and ya'll settle
I rip rappers and take responsibility

Ya'll are lost for words like conversation on your worst first-date,
And raw beats
Creep through side streets
Loose leaf notepads
That's where rhymes leak
Punch-lines, man, don't even beg
I got knee-slapping tracks, ya'll cruisin' ya leg
You a rhyme-writer, buddy? Man, that's a joke
You ain't worthy of being my secretary, man that's a quote

We gon' do some things right now
Show you how we do 'em in the Bean, why'knahmsayin?
N.Y. representin', Dirty South representin'
Chi-Town, L.A., they all doin their thing
We got a lil' somethin' bubblin' in Beanpot over here why'know?
I got my crew right back gon' show you how it's done
Straight up, hittin' one two like Manny and Ortiz ya heard?

It's John Cena baby, and we heatin' up the Beanpot
Big up Boston, you know the whole team hot
Yo we fresh, y'all a little bit stale
And we 'bout to make it ugly just like Kevin McHale

Cena takin' over
I'm 'bout to make the scene mine
I got a tea party, baby meet me on the Green Line
Ain't too many kids that flow better than me
Roll thick like Yassir sideburns in seventy-three

Like Tom Brady and the Pats, we rollin' kids
Cross me and pay a toll like the Tobin Bridge
From the home of the curse, y'all know what I mean
We like the left field wall, we stackin' monster Green

Knock you out of the park, you land on Yawkey Way
My shit be butter, but around here we say parquet
I rent my own team, we takin' over the industry
Like The Big Dig, baby nobody can finish me

Yeah, it's Trademarc baby, biggin' up Boston, yeah
6-1-7, 9-7-8, 7-8-1, 5-0-8, and 4-1-3
And I don't mean to brag, but it's in the bag
And we alone on top like we goin' stag
It's a dynasty, that's how I see things
In four years we countin' three rings
I'm the MVP, baby gimme that key ring
And me, Brady and Branch'll own our sweet thing

Yeah, and we ain't gon' stop
We at the Eagle, cook 'em all as they flop
And T.O. takin' on the be roll and that's the past
Beatin' everybody and the salary cap

What now? You say titan's your rep
That's like Peyton winning big games out on Gillette
We don't forget y'all, we're keepin' it grimy
Had the Steel Curtain lookin' like venetian blinds
Yeah baby, that's how it go
That's why next year, it's lookin' like 3 in a row

Yeah, uhh
It's Esoteric, tunin' in
Puttin' it down, for Boston Mass
Yo, I rep the Bean, y'all see the way it be
Home of Source magazine, the Pats and Edo. G
Steadily, poetically I'm Bill Russell in command
Peace to Dorcester, Roxbury, Mattapan
Pack a man down quick like neanderthals
Standin' tall after brawlin' up in Fanueil Hall
As a young buck moms said I disobey
All she heard was Nomah like fans in Fenway

But they sent him to the dugs, I'm like Manny when he shrugs
And it bugs me to see the women wearin' [unknown] in the club
A deadly combination like venom hit your blood
Jason Varitek with the glove, it's all love
I'm like Schilling with the red sock, when I get hot
My aim is dangerous, like the Larry Bird set shot
It's clear now, you livin' in fear now

Tha Trademarc,"[Bumpy Knuckles a.k.a. Freddie Foxxx]
First and foremost...
Flow easy, yo
Yo, yo, for the hood (for the hood)
Everybody flow easy, ha ha, so easy
Yo, listen
For the corrupt mob, John Cena, Trademarc, listen

I embarrass MC's who touch the mic with me
That's why they never holla when it's showtime - gimme
I spit poison like a black snake bit me
Guns up in the E-Class, D's can't get me
My foot is a 13, 12's don't fit me
My heart is cold and hard like Jack Frost bit me
So many new flows old flows start to panic
It's time they got built by the mic mechanic
y'all heard, I stay in hood streets like curbs
And never forget, where I come from, word
I ain't goin broke, fuck you, I'll cop me a brick
And take it straight to the block, forget rap quick
Don't trip, Bump got a speed zone sign
For suckers who move too fast against mine
I'm pressed, pushin it full speed ahead
You left, bullet in chest, meet the dead, so

[Chorus]
Flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
to flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, but yours don't sound like mine
I flow easy, turn up the mic it's time
I flow easy, whenever I spit my rhyme
I flow easy, the underground pound and grime
Flow easy, so yours don't sound like mine I flow easy

[Tha Trademarc]
Philosopher first, rapper second
Manifest the message, lessons involved
It all but hits you, aviate your crew and lift you
So what's the issue? Trademarc has got it locked before he meet you
Greet your mind before we even greet you
Won't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you
Take it down a notch, slow your roll
Cause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul
I set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics
Man I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics
Run my mouth off like high school rumors
Man and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers
Flow easy like your first day with white sneakers
You just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers
Huh, you better rock a sleeveless
Freddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through
y'all are fuckin divas

[Chorus]

[John Cena]
First and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo
Turn a hard MC to jello
Make their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear
Man, we in for one hell of a year, yeah
Curse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks
I'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx
Known to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow
Like wearing a weight vest and lead socks
I'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry
Never let a bitch take a bill from me
Like Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money
Best believe the flow water, we still runny
Make your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick
With 16 bars twice the value of gold brick
Make it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the cheese be	
So believe me

when I pu-pu-pull the pin out, keep frontin

How to be
Effective

Do y'all know what time it is when everybody game
is everybody else's hustle and everybody's shame
is somebody else's blame, whatever I became
I did it with hot rhymes and a lung full of flame
I never refrain, from loadin up and takin aim
Like chicks flows are different, I never cum/come the same
My mic will be the dame, written or off the brain
I show up with my chest pumpin hard like Notre Dame
I lose then I regain, hustle is in the vein
I'm drinkin protein shakes to muscle up the brain
In the black Chevy Suburban sippin champagne
with champagne, dick out doin the damn thang
We movin in the fast lane, with them black thangs
On the way to the Bronx, to do the ski-mask thang
I don't know what's so funny cause I ain't laughing
The part is for a dead body, guess who's casting

(Chorus)

(John Cena talking over sample)
Alright bro, I'm hearin you
I'ma see what I can do
See how I can rip it
And be, effective
Follow this

(John Cena)
Cena spittin with the Bump Bump Bump for the Knux
Your whole crew gettin dumped dumped dumped with the chumps
We rollin like Donald Trump Trump Trump with the bucks
Your bitch-ass gettin jump jump jumped cause you suck
Follow me, you stick around round round when it's hot
You claimin that you down down down but you not
You try to offer me a pound pound pound you get got
I can't wait to hear the sound sound sound of you shot
You hearin me, it's time to show show show I got plans
That's all you brought you bettter go go go get your mans
A legal hustle, ain't no no fuckin with grams
Stash the heat cause I can throw throw throw with my hands
I'm tellin you, on screen screen screen with these flicks
Catch me on the scene scene scene with three chicks
I fuck like a fiend fiend fiend with three dicks
Fuck a sixteen teen teen I'm just sick

(Chorus)

(Trademarc over sample)
Yeah, what's good fellas
I'm feelin y'all man
Most these cats
Can't engineer, they career
Yeah, Trademarc, bout to
Bout to show y'all
How to be, effective

(Trademarc)
My camou' colors dog they be beige and brown
That shit was all love 'til you cowards came around
With the same ol' sound that's why your payroll down
That's how the game go now that's why you ain't gain ground
Cause you stuck on then dog, you ain't on now
And that's how it's been baby cause you ain't know how
You move your pen lazy maybe or your beats don't pound
I move quicker than the word on the street go 'round
I write down every lesson that my peeps hold down
You let your heat go blaow if you ain't speak profound
I write sixteens down 'til I hit green now
Makin up slang, ain't know what shit mean now
Trademarc, Marc Predka, jot the real name down
You can catch it on every marquee in town
Sayin Trademarc, ain't nobody like you now
Probably sweatin this track dog, go wipe your brow

(Chorus - 2X)

You see, that's all it takes
Is for a man to make an effort to be, effective
And if you're not, effective... then you're defective

This rook'll take your queen and put ya king in checkmate
Open your mind without makin' ya meditate
We real champs, y'all just featherweight
Time to get it straight, I push your wig back
Crew loaded up with extra bread like a Big Mac

Beefin' with us? We're leavin' you face down

Runnin' the playground like it was a track meet
Shoes on the whip that be bigger than Shaq's feet

I'm ego drivin', seen with different women, every size and frame
I refine my game by fuckin' famous bitches
But it's all the same, it's just ex to the next

For sex or brain, misses or Mrs
Married or not, my game don't stop
It's cars bars bonds and stocks you ain't see my flow

Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground
What now?
Preachin' on the way that they handle thing
Watin' patiently to do the six-foot same thing

I made too many mistakes that I just couldn't make right
Should've been more focused than I take things light

Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool
Not a big name playa, in fact its true

Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform
Unexpected, there's a knock on my door
I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before
Open to great him, but the second he sees me
His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy
But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first
I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse
Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin' down
Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin' out
Says I've been sleepin' wit his wifey
And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit lightly
I made a move and he told me homie wait
Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38
He asked me if I'm ready to die
Said he was gonna pull my brains all over the sky
Said he was leavin' the country, and he was straight with the passports
Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin' my last thoughts
I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this.
I close my eyes hopin it's painless
Just waitin' for the sound, ready to swallow too
But homie havin trouble with his follow through
By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground
Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down
His wife is sleepin' through town and he knew it
Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it
Just lost it, and as he's walkin' away
I realize life is short so I'm markin the day
Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead
And I could give a fuck what the next man said
I live how I wanna live
Buy what I wanna buy
Do what I wanna do
Try what I wanna try
Fear nothin', take chances
Not afraid to fail, always makin' advances
So when I ride on the grim reaper highway
No regrets bitch, I did it my way
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin' out, ain't no one you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin' out, ain't no one you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?

Tha Trademarc,"[Chorus:]
This is just another day in the life
Seven flight connectors - past due bill collectors
This is just another day in the life
Mo' money mo' problems - and I ain't got money to solve 'em
This is just another day in the life
Gettin' mobbed by fans - man nobody even knows who I am
This is just another day in the life
This is just another day... in my life

Everybody askin' me - what you really like?
Is this really life? Do you really fight?
Do you fear the mic, when there's millions watchin'?
Are you super rich now, how much grip you coppin'?
You the new kid, now you gettin' some shine
When every vet sayin' that it's not yo' time
My hustle is non-stop and it's not yo' grind
Plus I hear very clear, I'm not so blind
Beef I don't sweat it, sleep I don't get it
I remember your face it's just your name I forget it
These days they melt together as one
I got some plans to do shit that ain't never been done
Take this game into battles that ain't never been won
I ain't gon' walk through life, I think it's better to run
And yeah I'm eatin' right if you askin'
But the size of my wallet that's reflection of passion

[Chorus:]

Just another face in the crowd, so to speak
Huh, my electric was cut off last weak
No heat, no food, no money, no girls
And if life's my oyster then I ain't found pearls
Makin' moves every day so the ends could meet
No gas money, so I use my legs and feet
Everybody I meet man, they likely saw
That I be in the same clothes from the night before
Shoes so old you can call 'em retros
Man I'm so damn broke, even my wallet echoes
I got a dollar and change; man, I'm under the gun
That buck's the only thing keepin' me from bein' a bum
That's why I'm writin' these words man, so I can get on
So I can realize bein' poor was makin' me strong
And the only reason I can't rub pennies together
Is cause I carry big bills, in genuine leather

[Chorus:]

Shakin' hands with some fans by the thousands
My place so poor, looks like public housin'
Gettin' the Porsche when I shoulda got the CL6
My ride broke down, I'ma kinda between whips
Face on the Xbox, you played the game lately?
Man I can't rent, I owe too much in late fees
Do I, charter a jet, or fly first class?
Do I take a cab? Bus seats hurt my ass
Pay my jeweler in cash, he don't take a check
The chain I rock, leaves a green mark on my neck
Do I get the fillet steak or the shrimp and crab mix?
Do I get a number three or a number six?
Get in the club V.I.P. man they lettin' me slide
Man they bust me for dress code, I'm still outside
Everybody want to be down, but I ain't got no friends
Man nobody's around, I ain't got no friends

Hahahaha...
Y'all know the rep, yeah, listen

My name is Bumpy Knuckles, I write that fuckin flame
And kill for the right price I got a buckin name
My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim
We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin game
I'm nice with mics there's nothin more I like
Than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right
I be layin front of your crib with Tec-why all night
Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen
I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap
So smooth contest you'll be out of that
Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin
You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin
I make aight hot, I make dope raw
And send you higher than a long Colt four-four
You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor
And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor

[Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
We keep on, once the cops are gone
This is real street spit you best be warned
Tell your favorite MC the mic is on
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
We keep on, once the cops are gone

[John Cena]
Yeah, yeah
It's the J daddy, not Hov' or Jam Master
My mic is correct, but y'all know the hands faster
See you bitch rappers I'm attackin the pile
Y'all be cryin foul cause I'm hackin your style
I make sure you and your mans done
When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin And1
You see me on the team dog you know the game's over
Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder
Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat
Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats
And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change
Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged
We rollin up in the blacked out truck dog
It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Corrupt Mob
It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze
Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade

[Tha Trademarc]
This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat
Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy
Give me a beat, man I'll body that
Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that
What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap
You lost the beat, man you bought a map
Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that
Been off the street too long, I want my corner back
You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback
You ride the beat like side streets on a flat
Don't play dumb, I know where you came from
You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come
Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch
Like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle
It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down
A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?

Not quite crispy green, but we came to stack dough
We ain't maxed yo, we just try and get this money right
Bills made of Spandex, I still keep my money tight
Never stoppin, all I see is the money like

If you got in free, or your fuckin cover's paid
Bounce to this motherfucker like you was some Rubbermaid
This ain't that Cristal sippin type shit
It's that bottle breakin, startin riot type shit

Anything but that, step back lady
Trademarc, John Cena, clubbin it up
We got Chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up
I'm all about laid back, don't jock, I hate that
I see through haters games, don't mistake that
I still got love if you buyin our shit
If you claim you hatin us, but you ridin our dicks
Everybody hear the name, Marc Predka
It's gonna ring like an echo for years, I never left ya
All y'all raise your glass to this shit
Cause Trademarc's the head of the class of misfits

[John Cena]
We steal your top spot, and you not gettin your number back
Chop down competition like I was a lumberjack
Clear out the club floor, we keep 'em comin back
Tough to bring down like an overweight runningback
Yeah - and we blaze 'em baby
Trademarc, John Cena, we amazin baby
Yo we tear up any crew, leave a motherfucker worn
y'all are just soft like some Cinemax porn

[Tha Trademarc]
I move a crowd like a bomb scare
Grab the mic when we hittin it right, if you want fear
Some say Trademarc, he ain't all there
We old school like when Sonny, was on Cher
Take it back like a Richard Pyror 8-track
And grab a chunk of your change like a state tax
Man please, we want platinum plaques
I want cream, green, cheddar cheese, to grab in stacks

You can't help but feel it
Can't help but feel this one

Excuse me for a minute while I lighten the mood
Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah
A bit of soul food that you be bitin into
And if you feel me then I'm writin for you, uh-huh
Right now put another coat of wax on the ride
For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side
Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to
Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you
It's okay to be hard and stay true man
But at the end of the day, we all hu-man
This one's for you, the ones that you close to
Show some love, it's what you supposed to
Right now, forget the ends and the Benz
Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends
Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now
Cause everything lookin pretty good right now


Right now baby, we all gon' ride
So place those things on your hips or side
The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame
But sometimes the moral change or stay the same
Relax baby, right now you here
And sit back baby, with a round of beer
And cheer to those friends who crowded near
For those passed on in spirit they there
It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew
If you got kids take the crust
It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong
And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on
And take it slow baby, cause everything real
When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal
Thank God that you healthy and you keepin it tight
And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin at night


Yeah - and right now I'm showin love to my brothers and my old man
To my girl, ""Let's Get it On"" like the slow jam
To everybody that I'm runnin down the road with
y'all my family, I know that you know this
Fox, Rock, be	's and Chaos
y'all growin up with me man, true to life players
Grandma or grandpa watchin up above
Trademarc you my heart cousin, nothin but love

Thanks momma, for all that you was
You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love
My sister raised me, those are the facts
And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed
And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh
Yeah John, what can I say?
It's all love from day one, you showed me the way",Right Now,2005

Walk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me)
Crew heavy on the thick side
Everybody feelin this, y'all know we serious

I'll be makin you move so quick you can't see me in slow-mo
Get your throat cut when you step in the dojo
y'all got no flow, we be makin hits
You like a proctologist, you feelin my shit
Yeah - you all hype like a street team
I spend more time holdin a mic than Mean Gene
Makin beat fiends scream, they be lovin the click
Roll solo to the party but I leave with ya chick
Cause she know that when I'm flowin it's hot
There's a party in my pants, she be blowin the spot
Buck naked in the old school drop, givin me skull again
She give me free strokes, that's why I call her a mulligan
See me on TV, knows everything about me
You can't fuck with me, she can't fuck without me
And if you think she don't be lovin my thangs
That's like sayin you eat at Hooters for the buffalo wings, what?

[Chorus]

[Tha Trademarc]
Fuck record execs, promisin checks
I been cleanin tables now I'm seein labels, these chicks
sayin ""haven't we met,"" man holdin my breath
Feel like the lesser of two evils that I haven't seen yet
I got girls runnin game with a pimp strut
Big butt booty bitches tryin to link up
They walkin toward me, conversation and they body bore me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
Nas said it before, that's raw
If you leavin the club your clothes'll end up on the car floor
Man, I got no time for words after sex
I just kick you to the curb and be laughin next
Cause Trademarc is a clingy chick's nightmare
Even though you took me home, I won't spend the night there
I've had hookers to virgins, on they back
Wild sex all the way to dead lays like necrophiliacs

[John Cena]
Johnny Cena got the girls, girls but I'm not Jay-Z
I play the field, I never let the field play me
You see my Chevy? You know there's ten chicks aboard
Plus the whip got more switches than the mixer board
I'm stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range
Gave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change
She tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig
She called my dick Frank White cause it's +Notoriously B.I.G.+

Yeah we doin things now man
It's just another day in the life why'know
Always tryin to do some big bid'ness
Sometimes when we havin fun
Some shit goes down why'know, you ain't expectin nothin
Then, somethin come out of nothin

It was just another typical day in the summer
Me, Trademarc, Crouch and my little brother
We put the whips out, we cruise up to the strip man
Three wheel motion killin fools like a hit man
We on some chill shit, vibin out
But we still in the mix, fuck hidin out
On the corner of L Street, I locked eyes with her
I ain't steppin man this bitch had guys with her
She came through the crowd and walked over to me
Catchin P off guard, she actin like she knew me
Her name was Shannon, she was canon
She's hangin with Melissa, this big booty chick you couldn't miss her
This chick was like a fitted cap, all over my dome
Said she want to be down, but I ain't takin her home
That's when she said she live right down the street
She love white chocolate, well I got somethin sweet

[Chorus 2X: female singer]
Saw you walkin down the street and I
heard you say you had somethin sweet for me
Lover.. (somethin sweet) lover.. somethin sweet

[Tha Trademarc]
We run game, fill the blanks in, what's your hon's name
I can take an Eva hot bitch like bum change
Playin hard to get when I step, I'm afraid
I can treat a chick like cheap gas and upgrade
Whatever you need, whatever you want
With Trademarc on your arm, girl what more could you flaunt
There's just something about us, summer fling got you wondering
where I'll be in spring, but that's another thing
I'll be out girl, quicker than tans
If you want somethin stick hurr, stick wit'cha man
I ain't lookin for a lover girl, I'm lookin for sex
I can tell you I got money or I'm pushin a Lex
Whatever gets you hot, that's what I say next
Gettin passed through the crew girl that's a safe bet
I think it's funny how it doesn't take a whole lot
Trademarc's like an open flame, getting girls hot

Yo... with these sweet flows, the streets knows
whether we pimped out in streets clothes, we the bomb like deep throws
My speech grows to reach hoes - all over the globe
I got class like a Ric Flair robe

[Tha Trademarc]
Man I'm in and out quick like Jordan in the zone
D takin out a bitch like a pass from Shaq to Kobe
You know me with a extra set of hands
a bitch couldn't hold me man I leave 'em lonely

[John Cena]
If I catch a glimpse of your chick when she smile and fine
I make sure she lose your number, she'd be dialin mine
I ain't about a wife even if she won this right
I'll fuck for seven days but stand for one night

[Tha Trademarc]
Man we decked out John, the strict gutter
I'll have a girl repeatin my name in sex like the bitch stutter
I got moves lookin butter with a tight fade

y'all are fuckin clowns, you belong in a circus
This is big bid'ness, we don't stop 'til the money home
Block shakin more buzz than a honeycomb
And I'm a savage in the booth
I'm on some movement shit, about to rally up the youth
Number one seed daddy walkin through the playoffs
You better quit rappin 'fore I start makin layoffs
Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff
You don't ride to this? We don't need you, stay off
Hate on this? I don't care what you said
y'all can choke on a shit sandwich with no bread

I live poor but look rich, I hit raw, you look bitch
You love me, that's why you got your style from me
Most sayin Marc Predka's overconfident
It's only cause they jeally that my profile is prominent
The dominant factor is the money I'm after
Your opinion ain't mean shit buddy - I ain't ask ya
It's gon' be what it's gon' be
It is what it is and was what it was so watch ya wordplay

I write rhymes 'til ya boy is heard mayne

In a leaned out, old school, skylight blue
I don't think there's a player nice
Keep your Cristal, I'm shoot Jagermeister
Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace
Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat the case
I buy some land, and never even see the place
Vegeterian chicks, go on givin meat a taste
Throw away money like I hate on loot

See what happens when the ice age melt.
You monetary status is not what matters, but it helps.
I rock a time piece by Benny if any.
The same reason ya'll can love me is the same reason ya'll condemn me.
A man is measured by the way that he thinks
not clothing lines, ice links, leather, and minks.

(What's that?) That's the weight of my craft
I breathe easy, and let my chest slowly contract
And write rhymes to inform baby not to uplift
If you want to make it all, you gotta persist (yo put me on)
Yeah, all that talk's a waste
Cause I can read a man's thoughts by the way the lines cross his face
Hold five, everything live
And I vibe, ain't nobody thought this day would arrive
But I balance my talents with a hope and a drive
And ride beats dog, that's where my focus derive
And keep notepads and vocab, that's my guide
And if I got legit beef, I don't let it slide - what now

[Chorus]

[John Cena]
My brain is impossible to thinkin philosophical
Hustle in my blood, that's the only thing that's logical
The only thing I gotta do to stay on or stay strong
I ain't stoppin 'til I own the field that y'all play on
Desperado - eyes like a bird of prey
Cold soldier - crack snap your vertebrae
No heater - flow sweeter than Cohiba
Cinnamon dip, spice ride in the cinnamon whip
Quite wide on the benjamin clip
Might slide but we ain't gonna slip - no way
If the meek shall inherit the earth, guess what?
y'all get the globe if they measure in, lyrical worth
Trademarc flow first, make the mental work
Fuck a verse - I rearrange your dental work
And when it pop off, we not soft
We like the Bentleys; y'all just the Chrysler knockoffs

[Chorus]

[Tha Trademarc]
But that's life, yeah you hearin me right
It's like I had to find the black of night
come back to life with master insight that shine bright - I'm always learnin
My burden, to blow up gifts like this, I must endure the slow burnin
It's sort of strange, my philosophy's changed
I take chances, jump before the water's in range
And never wait for safe answers so if all that remains
is lookin back at my life it never seems like I wasted glances
Man it's all a big game, that's why it doesn't mean a thing
That I get money and fame, it's all the same
if you call me Trademarc or if you know my real name
Marc Predka ain't attached to ego
He's a hero for the average people, a blessing
Who transcends the essence of a poet with a street flow
It's not lip service I don't speak to hear myself talk
And I don't want to be a teacher; I'm grateful for all I've been taught

Tha Truth!,"I never freestyle for free, without chargin' niggaz a fee 
It'll cost a brain cell just to cypher with me 
I'm the type of MC, that rocks for the glory 
I don't give a fuck if you ignore me or camcord me 
Freestyle or written, spittin' with infinite ammunition 
For anybody tryin' to go the distance 
I promise ya no less than a hundred-thousand kilometres 
My bomb threats'll have you evacuatin' your continent 
I'm barbaric with the alphanumeric 
Hittin' you with lyrics that separates your body from your spirit 
This is for wack niggaz doin' shows and shit 
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin' it 

I roll with the wildest niggaz 
West Indian Island niggaz, unemployed jobless niggaz 
The foulest niggaz, who never smile at niggaz 
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggaz 
 
We savages, snatchin' microphones from amateurs 
Cause like women who get abortions, I ain't havin' it 
I rip you, my metaphor content, will split you 
Into little, powderlike crystals, so I can sniff you 
What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian 
Your rhymes are phonier than cubic zirconias 
Have you any idea what I do to crews like you 
How many niggaz in my career, I ran through? 
Comin' afta ya, blastin' ya, with the shotgun 
Like a front seat passenger 
You must be askin' fa', some sort of a massacre 
I'll attack ya cardiovascular 
Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes 
When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses 
Rip your speaker to ashes, and kick a hole in it 
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin' it 
 
You see I roll with the wildest niggaz 
West Indian Island niggaz, unemployed jobless niggaz 
The foulest niggaz, who never smile at niggaz 
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggaz 
See I roll with the wildest niggaz 
West Indian Island niggaz, unemployed jobless niggaz 
The foulest niggaz, who never smile at niggaz 
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggaz 
 
I'm the illest lyricist in America, MC's can't see me 
Cause I'm too quick, for the human retina to regista 
I roll up on ya crew quicker than long sleeves 
At a +Speed+ that would confuse Keanu Reeves 
So ask yourself, who am I? 
I'm the illest MC that you ever seen in your fuckin' life 
I hop into the backseat of a cab and rhyme 
Til the meter says 9, 9, 9, 9 
Line for line I battle any kind of MC at any time 
Whether they signed or unsigned 
Wit many lines, more lines than a million pair of Adidas 
More lines than the bible quoted from Jesus 
More lines than a African herd of zebras 
Niggaz just ain't fuckin' wit the 'cannabis seteva' 
This is for ALL you niggaz doin' shows and shit 
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin' it 
(Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holdin' it) 
 
See I roll with the wildest niggaz 
West Indian Island, unemployed jobless niggaz 
The foulest niggaz, who never smile at niggaz 
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggaz 
See I roll with the wildest niggaz 
West Indian Island, unemployed jobless niggaz 
The foulest niggaz, who never smile at niggaz 
Some hostile violent

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, I smiled and then
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shed a couple laughs, shed some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts, walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts but I know that the fault is mine
'Cuz I let him go
Tried to get over it but it's messin' with my mind (Because I know)


(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes

Guess I'm still in love with you

(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know

I'm in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' v-I, 
Keep it down on the low key, cause you know how it feels. 
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me, 
From the game she was spittin' my ear you'd think that she knew me. 
So we decided to chill 

Conversation got heavy, 
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow (watch out oh, watch out) 
She saying come get me, come get me, 
So I got up and followed her to the floor, 
She said baby lets go, when I told her I said 

Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me 
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl would be the best of homies 
Yeah (yeah) next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

[Chorus]

Shes all up in my head now, 
Got me thinking that it might good idea to take her with me, 
Cause she's ready to leave. 
Now I gotta keep it real now, 
Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty, and that just ain't me. 

Cause I do know if I take that chance just where is it gonna lead, 
But what I do know is the way she dance makes shawty alright with me. 
The way she getting low! 
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me. 
She asked for one more dance and I'm 
Like yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave? And I said

In the club lookin' so conspicuous. 
And rowl! these women all on the prowl, 
If you hold the head steady I'm a milk the cow. 
Forget about the game I'm a spit the truth, 
I won't stop till I get em in they birthday suits. 
So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes, 
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes. 
I left the jag and I took the Rolls, 
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrol. 
How you like me now, 
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand, 
Lets drank you the one to please, 
Ludacris fill cups like double D's. 
Me and Ush once more and we leave em dead, 
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say 

Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me

And even if they never followed us, who cares

We could've been more amazing
Crashed after we discovered
Our very own lane
You rubbed off on me in ways I can't erase
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Guess that didn't mean anything to you
'Cause I'm not your man
All the nights I spent with you not making love, just making do
Oh, I'm not your man

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head
I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed
I wish I could forget

What you take me for?
What you take me for?
Gave you everything
Yet you're still looking at me like
I could've gave you more, gave you more?
I ain't got anything left to give, 
Somebody better know if I'm the next of kin
'Cause the stress is killing me, 
Either you're feeling me or not
Either way I ain't gonna be spending any more money on Tiffany
I'm done with that, what do you think I rap for?
To buy you a bag? Are you mad?
I'm a catch, the type of man women normally go mad for
Sick of love, sick of you, 
Wish I was but I ain't though
Changed like a boy in trance, anything that you ask for
I can't say no, don't give but you take loads
The dinners and taxis, 
I ain't ever been attracted to anybody as much
I am in love with you so madly, ain't ever treated you badly
But no matter what I do, you're unhappy
Is it cause my dick isn't as big as Dappy's

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head

I wish I could forget

I should've known better in the beginning
When you said you were a fan of Beyonce
But the only song you didn't like was ""Independent Women""
""Bills, Bills, Bills"", bet you liked that though
Dough with a D, yeah you like that doe
Gave you a key to the crib only to find
Your you when I came home
A temptress, a seductress
Who possessed enough perzazz to make me obsessed
When you undress you wanna compete, sorry I didn't know
It was a contest, but guess I won
'Cause I came first, is that the reason that you're upset?
Why would you keep coming back 
If it's just sex if it ain't no good?
Or is it the rest that you're interested in?
All of the spending in the restaurants
I gave you everything that you ever wanted 
And what did I get in return for it?
Laboutin, Louis Vuitton, your shoes cost more than
I used to earn in a month back when I used to sleep on a futon

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head
I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

Send back my love

A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""

Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Tells me that you are my own.
