Kevin Rowland & Dexys Midnight Runners,"More please and thank you
Introducing the Celtic Soul Brothers and featuring the strong devoted,
Ladies and gentlemen, would you now please take your leave.
Because we've sat back looking and nearly been took,
Even been scared but now I don't care and I'm telling anyone who'll listen.
I've seen what's on show and now there's no more to know
'cause I've been there, 
I've been seen there, 
I've seemed it, dreamed it,
Beened it, schemed it.
Excuse me please, you're standing in my space,
So step aside, now your time's up.
Come on my friends, I would now like to propose a toast
To the strength I see that's surrounding me and those who've cared,
Oh yes, I've been scared and I'm telling anyone who'll listen
I've seen what's on show and now there's no more to know, 
Oh I've been there, 
I've seen there, 
I've seemed it, dreamed it,
Schemed it.
You see I know this to be true,
Now would I lie to you?
And I'm not waiting for approval from you
We're coming through.
More please and thank you.
",The Celtic Soul Brothers,1982
Kevin Rowland & Dexys Midnight Runners,"'ll show you them now, those boys without cares.
Who'd swapped dirty pictures and talked during prayers.
They grew up with wisdom they'd stored from those days
Nobody told them to get in they must change.
I'll show you them now. Come with me and
I'll show you them now.
The teachers laughed with them class idiot style.
After all they weren't their kids so why should they mind.
Boyish good looks held the wrath back a while.
Then they were drummed in and thumped in and soon left behind.
Alcoholics, child molesters, nervous wrecks and prima donnas
Jilted lovers, office clerks, petty thieves, hard drug pursuers.
Lonely tramps, awkward misfits, oh anyone of these.
Mortgaged up families looked at first too mundane.
But it's funny how with help all the lucky ones changed.
Some of them couldn't, there had to be more.
Music, I dunno, films, something special perhaps.
I'll show you them now, come with me
And I'll show you them now.
It's so hard to picture dirty tramps as young boys.
But if you see a man crying, hold his hand, he's my friend.
If these words sound corny, switch this off, I don't care.
Nearby he's still crying, I won't smile while he's there.
Nearby he's still crying. I won't smile while he's there.",I'll Show You,1982
Kevin Rowland & Dexys Midnight Runners,"Jackie Wilson said it was reet petite
I kind of love you
Yes it knocks me off my feet
Let it all come down
Oh let it all come down
And you know I'm so wired up
I don't need any more tea in my cup
Let it all come down
Oh let it all come down
Now watch this
Toodle langa langa Toodle langa fang
Toodle langa langa Toodle langa fang
I'm in heaven
I'm In heaven
I'm In heaven when you smile
And when you walk across the street
It makes my heart go boom boom boom,
Let It all come down
And every time I stop to think about It
Well little child you simply make my day
Let It all come down
Oh let It all come down
Toodle langa langa Toodle langa fang
Toodle langa langa Toodle langa fang
I'm In heaven

I'm in heaven when you smile

And somehow I think that we'll win.
Let's make this precious,
First let's hear somebody sing me a record
That cries pure and true.
No not those guitars. They're too noisy and crude.

There's no need to turn it up.

Kevin Rowland & Dexys Midnight Runners,"Show me them now those wild little boys,
the ones that spelled trouble and stole all their toys,
young boys with contempt and schemes in their eyes,
strong, rich in spirit with milk stains on their ties.
A little while later the first ones to smoke,
oh, I just stood there in awe laughing loud at their jokes.
Tinny transistors (Honk Kong made) and this weeks ""Parade"" 
Ah, if they'd accept me I'd have given anything.
Stolen watches and big studded rings, 
tall talk of girls and all that kind of thing. 
Ah, they just had something precious you know what I mean, 
such wisdom and style like I'd never seen. 
They helped me get older,
pulled me through each bad phase,

Kevin Rowland & Dexys Midnight Runners,"I'll need tonight to sit and think about this
Think what to do.
I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow.
Hollow sorrow's nothing new.
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
Until I believe in my soul.
Tonight I lost sight of all purpose
Despite all this trickery you told me was right.
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah you must be fucking joking.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between . . .
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here. . .
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.
I'll punish the body to believe in the soul, I will punish

Kevin Rudolf,"One night when I was asleep
I had a dream I could fly
I felt the cold on my skin then I opened my eyes
So I jumped out of bed went down the fire escape
Now I'm laid out on the street I wasn't running away
From something I could control it was inside of me
I didn't know where to go but I decided to leave
I still remember that night I've never been the same
Still wonder if I can fly, was it just a dream?

I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape
But now it's to late to say, I'm sorry

Turn around [x15]

One night when I couldn't sleep
I heard a knock at the door
She pulled her head on me slow then she opened my heart
I asked myself is this real I've never felt this way
She said I need to escape I said I know a place
So she laid down on my bed I said confide in me
She looked deep into my eyes and she invited me
She must have left me asleep she never said goodbye
Her angels took her away I guess now she can fly

I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face

That's when I made my great escape

Kevin Rudolf,"She walks in the room
In her mind she's far away
I can see her emptiness
But I just don't feel her pain

The love is gone
The only thing she was living for
Mister I'll never leave you
Walked right out the door, oh

It's killing me inside
The way I've seen her change
She writes her life story
But she can't turn the page
I hold her had, try to take her
But she pulls away
Shades go down, lights go out
There's nothing left to say

[Chorus:]
So I'm singing
I want it all but I take just a little
I feel her touch then I need some more
We get high just to try and relieve the pain
But a voice inside reminds me there must be a better way, oh

So I leave the room
'Bout halfway down the hall
I turn around, she screams out
What, you don't believe in love
Said I'll never be who I was when I was seventeen
'Cause every time I walk away
I leave a piece of me

[Chorus:]

Now I understand
What they were trying to say
Life goes by too fast
And people change
But she just wants to be
Who she always was
But you can't change a single thing
You might as well look up and sing

I, I just take a little
I then I need some more
We get high to relieve the pain
But there is a voice inside me saying you'd better walk away

And I take just a little
I, oh to relieve the pain we get high

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive

When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger

She tried to convince herself

Just like on the last day of school
They were gone by the time she got there

She's like ""Wooooah"" I finally found my place
And I'm like ""Wooooah"" this girl can't keep them boys away
And she say's ""Nooo"", see I used to have dreams
But I cashed in something long ago, that I can't redeem

Now your scarred, and these scars won't fade
I still know, you don't get something for nothing
Without giving up your soul

With the drink in her hand
And she feels like no one
She tries to put the past behind her
But she still owes him
If I ever get out of this place, things will be different
She still hides at the bottom of the bottle
And cries when she looks in the mirror

She's like ""Wooooh"" am I looking at myself
And I'm like ""Wooooah"" I don't see nobody else
And she say's ""Nooo"", that's the price I paid
And it'll cost me my life just to get out of the game

A few blocks for those who don't know
Down the hall punched a hole in the wall
Bounced out, all are in control
Certified son of a gun, learns life lesson 101
Don't fly too high on your own supply
Get burnt by the sun

Heard out to the LI sound
He started datin' models and he figured it out
He used to be a nice guy, then he cut that shit out

City, bus, the subway, cab, the runway
Ski masks and gunplay my past at a young age

Towers came down, Wall Street barely standin'

We Crook Brothers, opposite of Brook Brothers
My footsteps of Scatman Crothers

Five luminous minutes with me

But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara 
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

[Chorus: x2]

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

And I wish I could say, the things you do

We decided to try
Going our own ways for while
And give each other some space
But I never dreamed it would be miles
I thought she would cry
While she was packing up 
I guess something isn't wrong enough

She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here 
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me
You couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and
She's sure taking it well

There go all of my dreams
Melting like sugar in the rain
I would love to believe
She's only smiling through the pain
All the tears are mine
Shouldn't she be sad
After losing everything we had

She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here

Another lonely day
She tries to hide the pain
But her strong will is just a weak disguise
It's there in her eyes

She wants to be somebody's baby
She wants to be somebody's friend
She just needs a choulder to lean on now and then
She's no stranger to danger
She's had her heart broke a time or two

Promised her the moon

They've got a swimming pool shaped like the state of Texas
And a room with a view, on our honeymoon
We were learning new dances
I remember my hands were shaking
I didn't know what to do
You had to show me
And the world just seemed to stand still
In that road-side adobe
Two hearts, beating as one
Lost in the moon, found by the sun
Too soon to know for sure, but too late to run

Living day after day
Safe and familiar
But hidden somewhere

Where love is so deep it scares us to death

De mi pobre corazón!

Sin embargo
Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti;
Why estás dentro de mi alma,
Pedazo de mi vida,
En la ilusión querida
Que nunca olvidar?

Al cotorro abandonado
Ya ni el sol de la mañana
Asoma por la ventana,
Como cuando estabas vos...
Why aquel perrito compañero
Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día,
También me dej?

Off comes the clown's disguise
The curtain's fallin'
The music softly dies

But I hope your smilin'
As you're filin' out the door
As they say in this business
That's all there is, there isn't anymore

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends
I’ve got a funny feelin'
We're parting now as friends

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

As sweet a young child as you'd find
Her parents had gone to their final reward
Leavin' their baby behind

Did you hear this poor little child was only nine years of age
When mother and dad went away, still she bravely worked
At the one thing she knew to earn her few pennies a day

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers, you know those artificial flowers
Fashions from Annie's despair

With paper and shears, with some wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum
As snowflakes drifted into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

From makin' artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair

They found little Annie all covered with ice
Still clutchin' her poor frozen shears
Amidst all the blossoms she had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears

There must be a heaven where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers
And instea-a-ad of a halo, she'll wear 'round her head
A garland of genuine flowers

No more artificial flowers, throw away those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of society to wear
Throw away those artificial flowers, those dumb-dumb flowers
Fashioned from Annie's
Fashioned from A-a-a-annie's despair

To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care

The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air

Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful wonderful life

The sun in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there

I need is friend
Oh I need a friend

Not stand here on my own

Girbaud of the Manhattan I see you actin' bad
Jammin' that Lil' Keke ""Don't Mess Wit Texas"" CD
But right now I need you to take a...blown big break
And Lil' Keke 780'll do their latest out here 'n do his thang
This called ""Don't You Know""
Go on ladies you need to get wet on this one

(Chorus:)
Don't you know, that I love you so
Don't you know, that I love you so, baby

Don't you know, I love you so
I wan' caress you slow, from head to toe
Deep inside I go, baby scream fo' mo'
We can play our way, at this game I'm a pro
Let you run the show, a queen you will be
Satin sheets, pat lace, Victoria's Secret
And I know your body need it gotta make your mind believe it
All above, all the love, on my purpose is defeated
You have cheated on your man to his spirits a g
When you know that he got flicks with a playa like me
I guess that Lil' Keke has the key to the do'
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so

(Chorus)

Bubble bath in the spa, menage-a-trois
You a driver for a car, I'll make you a star
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
want to want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter?  Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

(Chorus)

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas & benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do want to be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you want to, are you gonna?  Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

Ahh...I see the little latest out there acting bad 
on that one right there

This man needs her back again
What we want is different
But what we need's the same
Yeah one man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain

If I'd only loved her right
She never would've left
And I wouldn't be here wishing
She was leaving someone else
I don't even know the man
Or mean him any harm
All I want is what I had
Back here in my arms

I'll be watching
Though my vision seems so dim

I'll be drifting, going nowhere
Till I hold you again

Kevin Welch,"The last time I thought about leaving
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked to myself out of believing
That true true love never dies

The first time I thought of returning
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a turning
And there was nothing on this earth gonna shut me down

[Chorus]
If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True love never dies

The fires of anger turn to ashes
And your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesomest night surely passes
But that ol' true true love never dies

Well I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow

I'm just on my way
I know my destination
And I'm gonna make it there someday
I am no drifter
This road will lead me home
I know I'm getting closer
But I'll never make there alone

Well I know you think you know me
But I don't believe you do

You might slow me down tonight

I'm sworn to independence and my heart is made of stone

I've been tapping my toes to the way you talk
I've been singing along when I watch the way you walk
I've got to do something 'bout you.

[Chorus]
I've got this (place/life) of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard, got no time for you
But I whiskied up my coffee cup
I'm sitting here trying not to call you up
And it's getting to where I don't know what to do
Something 'bout you.
Something about you like distant thunder

I can say I ain't been warned
But there's no shelter to crawl under
That's ever gonna save me from this storm.
Something 'bout you, I can't shake
There's something 'bout you
That's been keeping me awake
The whole night through
Something 'bout you.

Then I lay awake till the morning light tired of remembering

If I could only finally sleep awhile

That'll be me howlin' in the wind
Every time I come across your tracks again
Tell me how long has it been since I've been free
If you see a fire on the mountain side
All around the places I used to hide
That'll be me that'll be me

You and I we're gypsy born under the same old sign
If my tears for you are a thunderstorm my love is the sweet sunshine
You can't run far enough to ever quite outrun my love
I know who you're thinking of tonight

That'll be me walkin' through your mind
Talkin' to your heart most all the time
Stirring up memories of mine like a gentle breeze
If you hear somebody singin' you this song
Like they could sing it to you all night long

I feel fine, I feel fine today

I don't know where I'm going

He was impossible to hold
He'd fuss and fight and then he'd giggle all night
Terrify the whole household

But he'd listen to his bedtime stories
He believed what he was told
About gypsy camps, saddle tramps
And rainbow gold

He had about a million questions
Liked to drove everybody wild
He'd ask them stuff that was just too tough
They all told him, ""hush up child""

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
I don't know what else he could have done

He was a scholar
Though he never really went to school
He stood amazed at the world's ways
And he followed the golden rule

He knew a little bit about everything
He could pretty much guess the rest
And he always seemed to know what you mean
If you took him in your confidence

Now most people run around in circles
But he ran a real straight line
The only thing wrong was that before too long
He left everyone who loved him behind

So it came as no surprise
When he left his home so young
Looking for some kind of paradise
Looking for something that he hadn't already done

Well he got to be hard to keep track of
Everybody was a little confused
And then one time the old grapevine
Whispered the strangest news

Now maybe he didn't mean to do it
I understand it if you've got your doubts
But I got a good idea that the coast was clear
And he figured he'd just bust on out

Now friends I'm not saying that it was a good thing
I'm not saying that it makes much sense
I just know that he was the kind to cross every line
Jump every single last fence

So it comes as no surprise
That he left his home so young
Still looking for some kind of paradise
The fool thought he had to go all the way to kingdom come

The only thing that I really wonder about now
Keeps running across my mind
If he ever caught his breath between his birth and death

If he ever caught his breath between birth and death

There's not a thing that can't be done
Somewhere in this world of doubt
Someone's gonna work it out
There you go just like that

We learned to crawl we learned to walk
We learned to fly at Kitty Hawk
Next thing you know one afternoon
We're driving golf balls on the moon
There you go just like that
We've learned how to take our dreams
And turn 'em into fine machines
But there's one thing we haven't done
We haven't learned to live as one

We stand behind our borderlines
And talk about it all the time

Sang together for a spell
Till the Night Birds song became a warning

Morning would be coming soon
They flew off toward the Winter Moon
And they followed her down as down she fell
They followed her down as down she fell
How far down I'll never tell
Followed her down as down she fell

As down she fell she called out to him
""Aren't you cold without me dear?""
Her silver tongue sent shivers through him
He pretended not to hear
But she knew him like no others did
She knew where all his hurt was hid
He followed her down but he never got near
He followed her down but he never got near
He had no hope and he had no fear
He followed her down but he never got near

When the Sun King rose that afternoon
He looked like he had been through hell
All night he'd chased that Winter Moon
Ask him why, he could not tell
But when she finally turned to him
We all saw his light grow dim
And he followed her down as down she fell
He followed her down as down she fell
How far down I'll never tell
He followed her down as down she fell

would ever make me feel this way

get love to lead the way

You know for love
I'd go anywhere
I would go there
For love to the end of nowhere
And for your love

I would,
I would

feel her love is mine

Who would only dream of me
And she be in love
just because she wanna be
She wanna be loved

could you ever be thinking of

Kevin Whitehead,"She walks on through the night
Her circumstances slight
Are only helping her to fail
And though she feels she's right
She tries with all her might
And makes the deepest peril pale
Oh, but she is unreal
Oh, but she doesn't feel
Oh, but she is unreal
She chooses who to love
And then unlike a dove
She takes the laughter from their smile
She wears a velvet glove
Her friends may find it rough
It is a gauntlet all the while
Oh, but she is unreal
Oh, but she doesn't feel
Oh, but she is unreal

There ain't nothing that you cannot do
Then you grab for my heart, you just tear it apart
As I shoot all my love into you

Kevin Whitehead,"I woke up to a feeling, it was cold by my side
You had gone with the sunrise, leaving tears in my eyes
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind 

Well I walked out this morning, down a street with no name
To a club called ""The Loser"", like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription, it's the only one they do 

I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting ""Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!""
Felt a hand on my shoulder, heard a voice cry ""Just in time!""
Felt the quick push, felt the air rush
Felt the sidewalk, fell in line",Suicide,2001

And hold me in a firm embrace

Each time I want to go out on the town
You have a flimsy excuse
Well, baby, you're the one
Who's gonna lose

I'm hittin' the road
Gonna take a load off my heart 
I'm hittin' the road
We'll be better off apart 
I'm hittin' the road
Gonna make a brand new start 

I won't go on this way
No longer can I play the fool
And if you beg, I still won't stay
Not even just for a day
And I'll do just what I must
Baby, I have learned I can never trust
Your word to do what you say
But you're the one 
Who's gonna pay

I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I just rattle around

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
It took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind stayin in
There's another ghost here
She sits down in your chair
And she shines with your light
And she lays down her head
On your pillow at night

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shell of the man I was
A living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
It took my body, my soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls

And closed me in inside

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Your never gonna take me down

They wanna see me gone they wanna see me crawl
They wanna shut me up until I can't speak at all
They won't let me up they wanna see me fall
But it ain't nothing 'cause I done seen it all
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe at all
I lie awake at night I can't sleep at all
I got no strength to fight I can't shake it off
But that's the time in my life when I hear you call
You say hold tight you say hold on
You say it's alright you say stand strong
'cause my whole life I got a plan and all
So I don't worry about a single thing that happens y'all
Say what you want you can talk on
I'm a get on up and I'm a walk on
Now I ain't giving up until I'm long gone
So why don't you step it up bring it on y'all

You ain't never gonna take me down
(so you see I ain't gonna break)
Your never gonna take me down

MTV said I was just a hater
Magazines said I was an imitator
The industry said nobody's gonna take ya
Record labels was like peace out see you later
I didn't need them man I just got
Someone to depend on when it gets hot
So VH1 you can talk all you wanna talk
Keep ya hip-hop and keep ya lip locked
I ain't gonna listen now to them talk
I ain't switching up and I ain't gonna stop
I ain't giving up and I ain't gonna drop
Even when I just get stuck up in ruff spot
I ain't got much but what I just got
You see it's more than I need when I just drop
To my knees and I can see that he shows up
You can't break me down that's some real talk

You ain't never gonna take me down
(so you see I ain't gonna break)
Your never gonna take me down
(you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]

So what you gonna do when it falls apart
Who is the one man that you call upon
When everything that you know keeps going wrong
Plus you feel like you can't keep going on
See I know dukes your barely holding on
They wanna break you down but keep rolling on
They wanna take you down but don't let em y'all
They can't hold you now God's in control
Don't slow it down just walk it off
It ain't easy I know sometimes its really hard
Please believe me I know you see I'm battle scarred
With my knees to the floor that how I battle on
Say what you want you can babble on
This I know what I got so I travel on
Don't ever stop that's why I wrote the song
So ready or not now bring the chorus on

You must resist temptation

Bring the dawn
Or let it all be gone

Deep in your heart
Release the prisoner
Or be torn apart
40 years gone

One breath is all it takes
Then just let it speak
Your mouth is opening

Your fear is gone
The question in your mind
What is right, what is wrong
The guilt diminishes

The fire is proud
Oh dormant prisoner
Let the rapture enshroud
Like a newborn babe

Uttering its first scream of horror and amazement
Of horror and amazement
Aurora, save us now
Bring the dawn

Or let it all be gone

Kevyn Lettau,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

To the one I love 
And by tomorrow with the dawn 
I'll be there and he'll be beside me 

Sunlight, oh sunlight 
Bring me the love I need to guide me 
Shine it deep inside of me 
Sunlight, oh sunlight show me the way 

I look at the stars and I pray for morning 
Counting the hours till morning 
Thinking about his smile, his sweet smile 

I'm standing on the promise of a brand new day 
I couldn't face another night 
Staying all alone 
I know he needs me just as much as I need him

And when I hold him 
I won't let him let me go, no, no, no 
No more running far and wide 
I'm gonna stay right by his side

He's my sunlight

I try to put 'em all in one, you know
Just what I'm feeling, what I'm going through
I've been drinking so please bear with me

Eyes wide shut, barely eating, tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while watch em X me out
Magazine cover motherfucker, I ain't tripping my flow
Singing silly shit and maybe they'll listen to me when they sixty
Breaking some bread down, treat it like the Last Supper
Toast to all the time we were po' but still we had one another
Hoppin' in out of shuttles, I'ma be big momma
I'ma get rich momma, I'm sorry I ain't got a wife or kids momma
But look what I did momma
Got a house that I barely can stay in
A car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said getting money didn't make me feel alive
Hustling, arguing about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep sucking
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me?
Bitch I'm not for fucking, over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Moving on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them I was like a check
Another five years of slaving and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card Good Lawd, confederate flag shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistling Dixie want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promoting no violence, it's people out here been wilding
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smiling
Ain't no hotline worth dialing to say the world needs help
We too busy filling our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption for my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, ""Little one, everything gon' be alright""
My mind playing tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needing her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waiting on a sign or two
Like what I'ma do when my heart get rusty and tired
And it ain't shining through, and I think about death a lot
My father scared of dying, I can relate, I call him before every flight
In case it ain't meant for flying, I can't hold it back, can't control these tears
I mean after all these years I'm still the kid writing poems, too shy
To eat in the cafeteria, I'm two cups in and three shots away
I don't give a fuck about any of the shit I didn't have to say

It's hard to protect your feelings when you so exposed

Sometimes I think you do it just so you can walk out
And you're sayin' plenty things that you really don't mean
Or do you really mean it?

Then I say some foul shit just so I can hit back
But I don't mean it
We done went too far, damn I thinks it's over

Next time
I won't throw my heart away
I just won't
No I won't
Next time
I won't throw my heart away
Again

Seem kinda crazy sayin' you love me so much
How could you bring that woman into our home
Where my baby laid, damn right it's over
And the crazy part about it is I took you right back
I thought you were a changed man
I tried to work it out for the sake of our family
But you took my kindness for weakness
And my love for granted, oh ho
I should've known then, if you do it once,
You'd do it again

Next time
I won't throw my heart away
Again
I just won't no I won't (I won't do it, next time)
Next time
I won't throw my heart away, again (Sweet baby, sweet baby love)

Oh I miss you but I can't
Can't do this no more, can't do this no more
The love that we had is gone
I just won't do it no more

Oh I miss you but I can't

Stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only a dope man, I knew that wasn't a coke man
Flickin' starter coats man, man, you know man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggaz outside all winter
'Cuz this summer they ain't finna to say next summer, I'm finna
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no to tuition for havin' no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
We forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man your ass is grown

Say, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5
That still hustle, a nigga can't shine off 6.55
And everybody sellin' make-up, Jacobs
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say

My momma say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
Around the same time, Doe ran up in dudes house, couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game polemic, it's hard to get weight
Niggaz money is homo, it's hard to get straight
We gon' keep bakin' to the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say

My niggaz, drug dealin' just to get by
Sing, stack ya money till it gets sky high
Do me a favor kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25

And you're the type of guy to make a girl smile
Boy you've got me tripping deep down inside, and all these feelings for you that
I have I can't hide
People say, don't get down with you, but I know how I feel for you
Though I may deny it, I'm digging you and that's how I

I want to get you, want to get
Let's go and get down and dirty
Baby play the game, play my way
But either way it's all the same baby

There ain't no way, they can make me think I should go away
I've been around you baby everyday
And the song I sing, every word I mean cuz I cant stop something sent from above
Baby don't stop your touch, I could never get enough
Sweetie feel me up, with your precious love cuz that's how I want to get down

You don't know what to do with this you act like
Guess What nigga I am leaving you and guess what

I was so stupid for love
Thinkin' you was everything a real man can give me and more
But guess not nigga
I'm leavin' you and guess what I'm needin' my keys from you.
I was so stupid for love thinking you was everything
A real man can give me and more but guess not nigga I'm leavin' you
And guess what I'm needing my key's from you.

Nigga hears he photo I gotcha comin' up out her front door
Thought you had me fast but damn you didn't know.
Every time you paged her she would page me and tell me you were there.
And that's a no no I let you go for months thinkin' so wonderin' why you haven't hit this
In so long I'm a smart bitch and I gave you the rope and now your hangin' there.
Tell me what in the hell your thinkin' not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh
I let you get away with this nonsense for to long ain't gone be no more callin' this yours

That you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me
That you've changed your ways I'm leaving today

Rollin with my window dropped
Wind blowing, about 6 o clock
Then this feeling came over me, got to find myself a pretty young thing
So I took a left on the next block, saw this shorty so I had to stop
Girl was looking as fine as could be yeah
I said do you want to ride with me

[Verse 2]
Your car is looking real smooth, and you looking kind of cute too
But boy I don't even know you, where the hell you think we going to?
Girlfriend had a little spark, so I parked the car and just walked
I don't mean no disrespect love, I'm just trying to see what you're made of

Superstar, like the cover of a magazine
No matter what you do, you'll always be my superstar
Superstar, I'm your number one fan by far. Superstar

[Verse 3]
Baby boy is into me now, it's time you let me break it down
I just reminisced on how we met, and this is something I would never forget
From the moment your lips said hi, it's like I pictured your name in lights
I bought tickets to all your shows, and I'm going to be there sitting in the front row

Keyshia Cole,"Sounds like a love song, sounds like a love song
I already heard your side of the story, hear mine
I'ma tell you why, cause you changed, (baby you changed)
When you got dough (you got dough and changed), 
Nah nah nah nah nah,no you listen, (what was I to do)

I remember like yesterday,the very day I met you
You were looking fly, I was acting shy,
So when you walked on by I ignored you
But then you turned around and asked my name
And in an instant my attitude changed,
Swept me off my feet,you were so sweet
Full of comedy, you amused me
Gave you my number, next day you called
Asking if you could see me
So I said alright, you can stop on by
It gave me butterflies,
30 minutes, knock, knock its you
I'm glad to see you, but I keep my cool
From day one I fell in love with you,
But now I ask myself who are you
Because

[Chorus]
You've changed, you've changed
You got dough and changed (and I don't)
You got dough and changed (baby you changed)
It wasn't the same, you got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
What was I to do

You were never there, why should I be there
There's no one there to hold me
I'm young at heart and age and these are the days,
When a girl like me needs loving
If hes not then someone else is
Getting what he calls his
Wasn't taking care of home, left me there alone
So whats a girl to do when she's feeling in the mood
We were together but we grew apart
Thinking with my mind and not my heart
Packed up all my things, left the engagement ring
Cause from the looks of things, I cant do this
Live this life that I call my life
If this is what its like being your wife,
I'd rather be a friend than through the thick and thin, 
But now is the end of my suffering

[Chorus]

What was I to do? sit around and wait for you to call
When I wanted to be in your arms
Missing you every minute you were gone
You were gone too long
Doing who knows what, who knows where
You act like you didn't care,
When I told you, I wouldn't be here
Cause you changed

[Chorus]

No it ain't about the cars, with the rims or the rings
No it ain't about the lies, or the houses, and things
Perpatratin' with the clothes, broking promises please,
No it ain't about the life that you giving to me

No it ain't about it, no it ain't about it [Repeat: x2]",You've Changed,2005

F*** that light s***
I nodge out tha garage double pipe s***
On Rodeo like, hey, yo, ma, I know you likes dis, ha?

Capital S, capital H, capital Y, capital N, capital E
What y'all kno about G fours, SL's wit automatic doors?
Flow sick, no s***, row six, head crack
Walk tha street wit my chain out the frontin'
F*** y'all n****s walkin' 'round like y'all sayin' somethin'

I changed my mind
I don't love you

Don't waste my time
I don't love you

On the corner an' you see me hangin' out
Wit tha n****s on tha block
What's it all about?

In my body but it don't gotta to live it's up to me but if I keep what 
The fuck I got to give I mean I'm still young and I don't really have

That I conceived but I sat there because I felt I had to and I cry everyday
Because I realize boy or girl that I wanted to have you don't be made at me

Damn, this is for all my women that's been going through the struggle
On welfare, living the rough life (oh I cried, but see I'm thankful)
It's gone be alright, that's right (Thankful for the trouble
For holding me down, every day, oh yeah..)
This is how we gone do it, I want you to explain your story
Then I'mah tell you mine, tell 'em
(Uh, can't ask for any more.. more...)
Tell 'em Keyshia..

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Momma, where did you go wrong
Because I need to know
You got me living the life you were living
When you were young...
And I'm heading down the same path, uh
But the difference between me and you
Is, oh, hey, hey, hey

[Ghostface Killah]
There's not a difference, boo, it's real life..

It's not ya momma fault, it's ya fathers fault
It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic
Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain
And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain
She Lost her first child in 74
And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw
She can't take it she constantly cryin fallin down on her knees
Like help me lord please I'm ready to leave
All she needed was somebody to rub her feet
Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets, come on

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
There's not a difference, boo, it's only an 8-figure, back me up

I been sent by an angel to snatch you up
Take you way above the clouds and back you up
At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin
Don status in the sheets I'm keepin you warm
Ain't no nigga gone do what I do
Imah take care of you and ya kids
Take the bent and go handle ya biz
The bills is paid,the cable back on
I quote you know the seeds want they nickleodeon on
I'm not ashamed to sport you
Floss you or gloss you out
Fat, skinny out of shape I'll dior you out

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Wipe ya eyes..

Yo in the hood there's a struggle
My girls is in trouble
She lackin guidance in the mind she's blinded and puzzled
Her pops never showed her the ropes
Her moms raised mad kids on her own
She never had a strong man in her home

[Keyshia Cole w/ Ghost ad-libs]
Stay stroooooooooong
Oh, hey, said we're gonna stay strong
No matter what
Yeah.. we're still here to see, hey... (that's my baby, that's my baby)

You know you wasn't raised like that
You need to hit a club or something
You going out, Keyshia

So while you going out having your fun, I should sit here waiting for you
All this time I've invested in you baby,
Now you kicking yo dubs and making yo runs and popping yo drank and having your fun
But see its OK, cause what goes around comes around and its always been that way

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one

She cant love you like I do
Didn't I tell ya boy
Didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you
Didn't I tell ya boy

So now the sun coming at ya won't change, but I ain't sitting out there crying and shit
So while you rolling out doing yo thing, I be popping my bottles,
Rolling on dubs, hanging with my girls, I be having my fun

You should call, ain't nothing changed you know her name
See her riding something clean looking hella fly
I know you first should change your mind I'm bout to tell ya why
She ain't staying at the house she goin out
To some exclusive shit, that you don't know about
Knew she wouldn't be curled up, crying with a broke heart
She bout to get chased and go hard
And if you wanna run the streets, chasing hoes dude
She'll be out chilling cause you ain't doing what you suppose to

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one
Be the one and when its all done boy

Keyshia Cole,"Been sitting, thinking bout you
And I am wondering why were not getting along
So frustrated cause what we had was a happy home
I don't know what the situation is
But I could tell in the way we kiss
We don't talk no more it feels better when I'm alone

Sometimes I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away?

Baby I'm slowly falling out of love with you
I don't know what to do
How did we end up here this way what are we gonna do
I'm slowly falling out baby I'm tripping on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me half way if you want me to be with you

I remember when I be with my friends you checked on me and made time to call
But now things have changed
Now I don't hear from you at all (yeah, yeah)

Sometimes I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay

I don't know what to do
How did we end up here this way what are we gonna do
I'm slowly falling out baby I'm tripping on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me half way if you want me to be with you

Don't let your pride get in the way
On something we worked so hard, don't throw it away
I've been trying to make you see everything you need is right here with me

Sometimes I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay

And then you changed and flipped on me.
So tell me what's the reason all this time you've been preaching, acting like you know
Everything.
Look into my eyes, and tell me what you see.
Was what you got worth losing me?
Now all your lies has caught up wit your game.
It's a different picture, but in the same old frame.
Tell me was it

[Chorus]
Tell me was it worth it, now that it's said and done?
Oh, did you find what you were looking for?
Tell me was it worth it, oh boy that's all I want.
Is just tell me the truth and nothing more.
Don't be confused and think that I wanna be back in your arms 
Because I closed that door.
Tell me was it worth it, for you to make that change?
And play that game wit me.

I gave all I could give you changed it all up for you.
But you didn't sacrifice for me.
So is it for the moment?
Are you really on it?
Either way you ain't thinkin' bout me.
Look into my eyes.
And tell me do you see, can you see the pain that you caused on me?
It's not the same.
We'll never be that way again.
Cause you can't take back those tears.
Please tell me

[Chorus]

Tell me was it worth it?
Worth it.
Was it worth it?
Worth it all.
Tell me was it worth it?
Worth it.
Was it worth it?
Worth it all.

I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch.

I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that

You better fucking not be there when I get over that house

Love you the right way, he ain't gonna

Go Keyshia!

Yes, woo, fire
I like this one right here
This one for all my ladies y'all
Holla! Uh huh, let's go

I don't want yo man 'cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like that, h-h-heh heh heh
Your man he be callin' me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact, h-heh heh heh
He ask how I do like that, fit my jeans over baby phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin'
But I should warn you, I don't want yo man

I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be gone, no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
(Baby I don't wanna worry no)

Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he
Where he wanna be

If he ain't gonna love you the way he should then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you the way he should then let it go

And when they play it in the car
They gon' drop they tops like,

They gon' mix it with Biggie, 
It Was All A Dream?
Like, damn! That's hot!
Me and Keyshia don't stop 'til the tick don't tock
Like, damn! That's hot!

Now I understand why I take my time
'Cause you come with alibis
Trying get me to see that's where you trying to be
But I don't want your man, your man?s been callin' me
Trying to get me to see that he wants me to be with him
But he ain't the one for me

And if you only knew
You would do what you had to, finally see that
(Finally get the chance to see that)
You have to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he, where he wanna be, yeah

Uh uh uh, here's a little lesson, Lil' Kim don't stress 'em
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke up with my ex, he was huffin' out
But little do she know she just a rebound

Callin' my phone, she's so out of pocket
I been there before, oh girl you need to stop it
Trickin' on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture? My picture's in his wallet

Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dawg roam now he wanna come home
But I don't trust him, though I still love him
No longer wonder lookin' at his cousin

Kinda buzzin', loose off the Goose
Got him on the chase like cranberry juice
When he's wit you, he's wishin' it was me
You might be where's he at but I'm where he wanna be
Baby baby, hey!

Let it go, let it go, let it go
(Let it go)

But it's starting to catch up, yeah, it's gaining on my a**

There's two types of *** predator and prey
I'm a predator, I pray 3 times a day
Mat Lue once said one day you'll have kids
And how you gon' explain all that *** you did

I'm a soul survivor far from a crook
She always said I was a lot smarter than I look
So I took my dreams and made it some thousands
Then I took my life and made it an album, I must be dreamin'

Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it

Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it

Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'

That we're perfect all the time

This is us, this is us and this is how we love
Some ways we're different but together we're so right
This is us, this is us and this is how we love, oh yeah

We can always find each other like the northern star

Keyshia Cole,"[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See, ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

[Verse 1: The Game]
I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boom box, had to say
Today was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the honey's
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say whoa!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name,
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

Plus the heart for red just like bo (""q""),
Feel me up, when I'm feelin' low,
When I'm home or out the road, no questions asked,

Let you calm, let you take a break and
Maybe things will turn around
I see I done went to the point of no return
And you don't even know
Yeah, I done fucked up this time, baby
Oh, yes, I did

Every time you wrote me a love letter
You had me thinkin' that you could do better
Calling all night but I ain't pickin' up this time
Oh no no
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
And you're callin' me all night
But I ain't takin' you back this time
Oh no no

But even roses die
I can see the light
When you're further
Hey!
Deep in the valley of the shadow of dawn
I got yo back like you got mine, baby and fuck everything else
And I just wanna fuck with yo mind baby to fuck everything up
And just as long as you ain't cryin', baby to fuck everything up
Fuck everything up
I had a time when God has told me
These Audemars ? Rings don't mean a thing
I switched it up, got princes cut that shit don't mean a thing
She on my nuts, she sayin' you can't keep your dick in yo jeans

Every time you wrote me a love letter
You had me thinkin' that you could do better
Calling all night but I ain't pickin' up this time
Oh no no
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
And you're callin' me all night
But I ain't takin' you back this time
Oh no no

Every time I looked in your eyes, baby
I thought that you really loved me deep
But see that's some shit you don't gotta teach
Yeah, baby
Lovin' you all night long
It feels so good
But I gotta let it go

I’ll be your man and
You can have what you want, I’m on demand for you
Right on demand

I don’t talk much
I don’t fantasize or bring thoughts up
See, see it’s on us
If it wasn’t for time then I would not rush
We could dump a cigar and beat the block up (roll up)
Making love run, make a heart bust
Say my words remind her of a harpoon
Her curves remind me of Starbucks
I get up for it, put it down on it
I done found an anomaly
Can tell that we about to beat
Come and climb the mountain until you finally
4Am, club done, dress down, fucked up
Text message saying “What’s up?”
And now what’s up, man tryna fuck

I feel the love I want don’t exist
But yet I’m still missing you
Can’t help but think about
What I really wanna do, to you (want it)
But I can’t help, I protect my heart (want it)
Cause you make me, want it (want it)
On the bed, on the floor, on the table baby

I got it, I got it, whenever you want it (whenever you)
Say my name and I’ll give you this loving (whenever you)
Break your body from sun down to morning (whenever you)

You can have what you want, I’m on demand for you
Right on demand

So give me all your loving boy

When you want it, you know that it’s nothing
I wanna give it to you
Anywhere you want it
Anywhere you want it
Anywhere, want it

Ain’t nothing better than them after party episodes
Man I kill that thing
So chill when I’m done better check her pulse
I perfect that stroke, so in turn can protect your heart
Lovely both sides works all
So we yearn for the lust right now
1 O’clock, 2 O’Clock, 3 O’Clock, yup
Got her like an untreated Vietnam vet
Give me your frame, I’ll make you my pic
Give me your skin I’ll give you my vest
Yes, I give you my word
Come close I give you that thorough
Make her share it with some other girls
But any time, anywhere know it’s all yours

I got it, whenever you want it (whenever you)
Say my name and I’ll give you this loving (I'll give you all this loving baby)

Keytones,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2008
Keziah Jones,"We've been conditioned
To believe what we said life.
No wonder we don't know
The meaning of ""I.""
It means the meaning of you
And the things you do,
Not the clothes you wear,
Or the talk we share.
And, now, pictures that lie
Tell us what to buy,
But never what to do.
When all your money's through.
So don't be deceived
By what your T.V. receives,
'Cause they'll pasteurize you cold,
And they'll advertise you sold.

Love your mind,
And free your soul.

Trip, dip, shake your hip,
And put on the Jones train to freedom.
Now, I've been meaning to draw
Some kinda conclusion;
About the time, the mind,
And the soul intrusion.
But the Keziah Jones train of thought
Has had to be ""derailed"" and ""defracked.""
Do to this groove found
Lying across the tracks.

Yeah, babe,
I've been meaning to draw...
I've been meaning to draw
Some kinda conclusion,
But we've been derailed;
Derailed and defracked.

If you do...
If you do,
Get on the train.
Get on the train.
Get on the train.
Get on the train.

Khaled,"وهران وهران رحتي خساره
هجروا منك ناس شطارى
قعدوا في الغربه حيارى
و الغربه صعيبه و غداره

يا فرحي على اولاد الحمري
اولاد مدينه و سيدي الهواري
عديت معاهم صغري
لهم فني طول عمري

ما احلى صهريات بلادي
القصبه و القلالي صادي
يا اللي ماشين ليها غادي
وصوا يتهلوا في بلادي

عمري ما ننسى بلادي
أرضي و أرض اجدادي
وصيت اهلي على الناس
تركوا دينهم و تبعوا الكاس

يا الزينه بالكاس و المايده
راه عشره بلا فايده
وعدي على الطحطحه وعدي
كان زينها زين الودادي
رجعت غمه في فؤادي

Khaleel,"(No mercy, no mercy)

The riptide greets the water's edge, he says it's good to meet again
The sun is out, it protects us, it lets the fish in my belly swim
Five thousand years ago, we danced with the comets from outer space
It was our nature them, indigenous, and now I feel out of place

(No mercy, no mercy) 
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's in our path
(No mercy, no mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

And then man came, we welcomed him with plants and food to eat
Tranquil rivers and tall pines for shade now all but obsolete
Brother dear would beautify the woods amongst us all
And now he runs and hides from the hunter
To keep his head from the hunter's wall

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's in our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), aaaahh (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

The gravitational pull
Can never be wrong
But to live all as one
Has taken too long
Mother Earth
And deservedly so
Has given birth to us all
And there's nothing to glow

But greed and corruption, violence, pollution
Hate, a disease, a new constitution
We need to gather 'round a global huddle
Give praise to the ones that we lost in the struggle
And spread the love, yo, spread the love
Spread the love, spread the love, spread the love

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's at our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), oooooh (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

And now the skies are covered up
From a blue to a shade of gray
A man in red many moons ago
Had a vision it would come someday
Five thousand years ago, the earth we now deny
Was the greatest canvas ever painted
Under the eastern sky

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's at our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), true (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world
(No mercy ,no mercy)
For the creatures and the fish, and the people of the sun
Aaaahh (No mercy), aaaahh (No mercy)
For the concrete and the chemicals, kills the nature in us all

Kills the nature in us all
Kills the nature in us all",No Mercy,1998

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard

You got everything to give right now

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don’t even matter
I know it, I know it, I know I'm hurting deep down but can’t show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home

You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

Khalid,"You'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm gonna hide this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
The ladders and stairs haven't changed
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts

I'm in love with the moment
To me fallin', to me goin'
I'm in love with the moment
To me fallin', to me goin'

Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Nothing left, pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we'll light a flame, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motions

I'm in love with the moment
To me fallin', to me goin'
I'm in love with the moment
To me fallin', to me goin'

Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take you back, lean you side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take you back, lean you side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right

Khalid,"""I think I'm fearful of things like traveling
I'm fearful of failure
I'm fearful of being embarrassed
Things like that I think hinder me from the best that I can sometimes
But I think that if I learned to be less fearful
I would get further
I feel like I'm not always in the correct direction
Even though I know I'm not on the right path
I'm like 'I'm on the right path
But am I walking the right way or should I be turning around?'
Like little things like that but I go back and forth
In my head and I think it's always nice to have reassurance
I think it's really nice to see how far a genuine person can get you
For me, at least, like, I think that's the reason that I am who I am
That I am a big mix of all the people around me
And I'm just happy
I can't complain about anything
So yeah
But I'm trying to get so motherfucking high, nigga
I don't wanna feel nothin' (wait, what?)""",Salem's Interlude,2018
Khalid,"Saturday nights
Newbury cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn

Family feuds, saying Mom's confused
I'm for sure she doesn't wanna learn
My daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishin' only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they only know what you let 'em see

And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights
Light gray Silverado
Drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
And fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowin' what you gotta do
You got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you never lose

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they only know what you let 'em see

They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do

I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here right now
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

They don't care about you
