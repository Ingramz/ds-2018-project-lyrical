Snoop Dogg,"I've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances,
But the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
To help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?
Marijuana motherfucker

Ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa premium rolling papers
And the qualified growers of Snoop Dogg master Kush
So without further a due let's get this show on
First contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background

Every time I go out, I'm goin to smoke out
I buy it don't even know the price
As long as I live it, come pay me a visit,
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's 'bout to go down, oh
We fly, it's not lie, that we high, 'til we die, oh
?

Got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smokin' with me niggas talk shit, all of 'em shrimp
I'm a big fish, roll a joint lick it once tell you hit this
Rubies on my dick, several cushions on my hit list
In and out these niggas bitches
Smokin' tree and  not to mention hustlin' tryna mount my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping
Yeah I hear what they sayin', just be too high to listen
Got my money trippin' if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smokin' this good, if it's fire I tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all
Or say fuck it, and cuff it till I roll with dog
I show up, I show up, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money comin' in and the papers rolled up
We ain't worried 'bout a hatin' nigga they get no love

Every time I go out, I'm goin to smoke out
I buy it don't even know the price
As long as I live it, come pay me a visit,
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's 'bout to go down, oh
We fly, it's not lie, that we high, 'til we die, oh
?

I go green like I was the Archbishop Don Juan
And blow circles 'round you suckers like a marathon
My gym teacher told, but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework, and now I'm in detention
It sure beats suspension, this is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention? Snoop Dogg was made for kissing
A barracuda fishin', she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory, and my inventory
My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancin' on stage at the talent show
We flossin' my clothes my chains and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can't you see my telescope?
Principal said she wanna see me 'cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money trippin' even if I fold it wrong
Blowin' zones with Wiz 'cause this is the protocol

Every time I go out, I'm goin to smoke out
I buy it don't even know the price
As long as I live it, come pay me a visit,
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's 'bout to go down, oh
We fly, it's not lie, that we high, 'til we die, oh

Snoop Dogg,"I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No sticks, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm blowin' every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

Concentrated, everyday I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I'm high as a muthafucker

I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No sticks, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm blowin' every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
'Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubber bands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it

I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No sticks, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm blowin' every gram I own

Don't gotta understand, they know

I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same

Every time I try to get my life to get to someone it seems
What you are doing try to ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away and always go get away

I'm not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same

Growing up I don't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and all the stuff till I was old enough
Getting every dollar before... so they could know it's us
Every party we are showing up bagging full of... never too long nigga
Matter of fact you can have it the one in rotation my motivation is savage
... and nigga think they are but they ain't no comparing
And they are not doing no harm but I think there is no comparing
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
I am your broadcast I just... just smell... when I go past
... I am kind of hot but you should know that

Uh, uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with you bitch smokin’ grade A

You know what? It’s like I’m seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I’m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

Get my lighter so I can light up

That's how it should be done

Got my nephew Nate Dogg in the house
Nate Dogg holla at 'em
Where you at?

Ridin' in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
People reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying for

And I wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuous
And then you just slide by and wiz-ave
You on another piz-age
Is that the way you gonna be-hiz-ave?
I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a player
Let me help out your pride?
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a psychologist
A shrink or a freak
Peep (my) my technique
I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the the one that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC
And I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too

You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin', watching ""The Lion King""
Crying and thangs
'Cause I'm with Snoop and Nate, singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late 'cause I'm grindin' for change
I ain't with dime for dames
Cock back and I'm trying to aim
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulating, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin' on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for the riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go
You know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagne, caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you

I never thought that we would break up for the better
Should've never made the promises to each other
So many things I should've said that you didn't know
Coming in from a past with a heavy load

But I knew that you were a good man
Give me love, you were faithful - It showed on my hand
I know there are questions in your mind you don't understand
Through the words of this song, I wanna answer them

Honesty (Check)
Conversation (Check)
A shoulder I can lean on anytime I'm feeling stressed (Check)
Good loving (Yes)
The perfect soldier (Yes)
Was about to say ""I do,"" when I know it wasn't meant
So I

Search in my mind, trying to figure it out
And thought I was happy but I'm having some doubts
Think I found the answer and I know I must confess
I'm still in love with my ex
And I wasn't ready when I said that I loved you
And in my heart, I know that I gotta tell you
I shouldn't have gone from a situation to the next
I'm still in love with my ex

Every moment that I stayed, I dug a deeper hole
I was with you but my heart wouldn't let him go
All my family told me, ""Kelly he's the one for you""
I know your family love me and I love them too

(I'm so sorry) I'm so sorry for the pain I put you through
But you shouldn't have to suffer cause I'm confused
So much for looking forward to future plans
Lost the love of my life and I lost a friend

Good to me (Yes)

You were all the things I wanted
Checking everything (Check, check)
You were comforting (Yes)

But I'm reminiscing so I had to consider
Did she go hard for me? (Yes)
Take a charge for me? (Yes)
Turn her head when them other hoes was callin' me? (Yes)
I can't lie, when she left she took a part of me
Part of me want her back but part of me can't pardon she (Nope)
Call it foolish pride but shit, who am I?
I made my mistakes, tossed my dirt to the side
Er'time we meet I see the hurt in her eyes
Cause I'm an ex-friend, ex-homey, ex-lover
So stop the phone calls, voicemails, etc
Shawty keep the ring, forget the day I ever met ya

Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door)
Lou Cortez creakin cross the hardwood floor (right)
Dippin through the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Man with no music but happy he's free
Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity
But just livin in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

(Snoop Doggy Dogg)

We're comin with that G shit, that see shit that makin niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I come with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
*?Teatley?* was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack

(Kurupt)

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill 'cause my ho might call
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocke, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only G

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go
Devoted and quotin, back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders
Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be levellin gettin sparked tonight

(Lil' Style)

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
'cause I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass
And everybody a blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust)
'cause I let it sit that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound
'cause he wouldn't even squad back
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah)

(Snoop)

Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been *?toetone?*
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on

(Dat Nigga Daz)

It's 5:30 in the mornin, now I'm yizzawnin
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And let me dial slow, flossin, tossin a bitch (bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me

(Snoop)

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too

(Young Swoop)

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
'cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah)
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G by the fuckin L-be's-see
None of these nigga wanna fuck with these (aah)

Woke up at the Ritz Carlton, damn sun in my face
Racks in my jeans, gun still on my waist
And I ain't leaving shit in my cup, that's such a waste
You know I'm sipping on that straight like that ""oh, what a a taste!""
Tip the valet a hundred, I love to stunt
Pulled up in that mean machine, leave it up front
This passed out thing beside me, I barely know her
But you can just imagine the shit I'm 'bout to show her
Snow way, them streets too cold, them bitches polar
Expectations out of this world, I'm thinking solar
That's why I do it for that Kalamazoo
And then NOLA, that's what happens
When you learn to mix it with that soda

[Chorus]

I wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up
Motivating factors that I'm liver than most
I boast and bang, pour some pain in that thing
Put some purple rain on your brain, unravel the flame
Maintain my fame, get you new pictures
Just to put in your frame
We in the hood blowing kush with The Game
Foot in the cane, walking just like I'm an Indian chief
With no beef, real brief, with a wreath
You may think it's a leaf!
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth
When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!
It's OK, cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip
With a fit on Crip, don't trip

[Chorus]

The coffee that I had, it was good to the last drop
But now I'm fresh out and you know it don't, stop
So please man, somebody call the weed man
I'd call mine, but he's been low on herb even
I'm fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs
If it's weed, then I'm with it
You got a paper? Then twist it. You got a bowl? Fill it.
Got a blunt? Let me split it down the gut
But shit for what? Cause ain't no green on the scene

Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
Club filled with dead bodies
If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good

Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High of something, high of something

High of something, high of something

Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

If you got drugs in this motherfucker

Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us

Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly

Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let's fuck!'

We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body

Ain’t no problem, I’m on it oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat x8]
Destruction in the club

Oh, no… Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I’m like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat x4]
Fatman Scoop, Maserati Cool J
They ain’t think I can do it, that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it’s Buicks

Had the guts to pursue it, that’s how a legend should do it

I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,
I've got my gun on me

It was murder she wrote, your name in blood
When the love's gone,
Your eyes diluted full of blood
Six cars full of goons, six blocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks, middle of June, head shots, get tombed
Stone, ten shots, five gone, 9/11 dial tone
You want it all, die alone
A war's going on nobody's safe from
Now we're talking to the judge when your day come
Like it was hard not to kill these niggas
It was like a full-time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures, need the eight story mansion
While I'm strapped up
Two-stepping with the devil dancing
Diluted with blood in my eyes
Like a stillborn,
Niggas won't make it out alive, nigga

Put it on momma that clip in the back, and I loaded it twice
Just a call away, my niggas is ready, no matter the price
Playing with mine,
You niggas could get it including your wife
Isn't life a motherfucker?
Since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
Sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing Danny Glover
AK40, hold a hundred if we're talking numbers
Riders' fucking with mobsters
Niggas want beef? Turn them to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your master
Bang bang, bless them father
Passed beside him, rest aside a lake
That's swimming with snakes inside
And look at my eyes, I hate disguises
Knife or gun, I compromise it
Oh Lord, I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight, I bet them gangsters remember me

With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion
'Cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop on soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us,
Slide with us, slip with us
Sit with us, slick with us,
This bad little bitch wanna get with us
Say she likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out

Body laid out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard me when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in his eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Over killing, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour
Like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

Let, let the bass move, let it go!
Bass, bass, move, let it go
Bass, bass, move, let it go

Some gain recognition and even fame
Some go slow and some may go fast
But me and my partners we dip and we dash
Every flipping the cash, rip zipping the bag
Should be slip when we crash, all good never bad
All you never had, dreams do come true
For me and you, so let it do what it do!

Boy, let me say, it’s the ride of your life

So put your seat belt on, and let your hair hang low

I never give up, I do this thing like everyday
And I break it down in her way
Oh man, I got carried away
But anyway I’mma say
I feel good everyday!
Every way, la, ta, ta
I’ll make the beat go pa pa pa
The heat, stop the beat
Listen, attention, permission
'Cause this is grand thing bang, bang
Same range, change lane
Playing games, get you with you, flick it up, rich it up
I slip can’t get with us
No matter what!
Next batter up
It’s better not

Come out the grass, so do it fast!

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013
Snoop Dogg,"Picture this, any man that hustle because like to is a fool.
Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice

wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad

I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

Snoop Dogg,"The past is an illusion, there is only now
The future is a fiction, there is only now
A brief intermission, there is only now!
Of this there is no question, there is only now
And if I get too lifted, would you hold me down?
And if you think I'm slipping, would you show me how?
The future is a fiction, there is only now

Check it
It was the kind of love most people only find it once
Divinely touched by angels, there was no time for lust

Plus some'll tell 'em that a teenage love will never last
Looking through the glass of past scars
So fast forward to the future
Where the youth them are a-changing

But this couple don't care what you saying
They're hearts blazing
Can't nobody tell 'em nothing
Their love is unstoppable

Overcome any obstacle
Together they will always grow
(Don't let go, I'm holding on)
He know they saying take it slow to him it's taking long
(Safest place is in your arms)
Her daddy saying this ain't right, to her it can't be wrong
(Baby, if we hold on a little while longer 'cause the love is so strong
You know that I would die if you left me)

I pray this feeling never leaves me, I want it forever
And I'll do anything to see that we always together
Whatever, it takes for something that no one can sever
Together, forever, whatever
It takes for something that no one can sever
And I'll do anything to see that we always together
Forever, together
Together, forever

What's love? Can you imagine being told, by the old
This ain't right, fuss and fight
Don't you roll, it's so cold
What's your mold, will he break or will he fold?
They on him, they want him, the homie Stoney
In love with his girl and so is his big homie
Now what a pity, a footnote to the cutthroat, it's rare
See, I was told all in love is unfair
One fee, one fare, done there
Fishing, dishing, and wishing upon air
Vision beyond years
Damn, people always pushing the wrong way
See my advice to the homie Stoney
Is do it your own way, the long way
And hear what the song say
Together, forever, forever, together, you dig?
See, this what it's supposed to boast
And get close and be with the one that you truly love the most
It's destiny

The past is an illusion, there is only now

They already move planets and moons
The plan is to vanish and move
Flip a townhouse down south pow wows with the gals
Out bound fishing boat where the city folks sip and smoke
Then these folks pushing the envelope
Which extended hope to a inner-most impulse
His desire for a child undisclosed

Deep inside a fire took hold
The moment that the plot was shown
Visions of intermingled souls
Matching afros, juleps on a creaky porch
Life at a slower tempo
No regulations to encroach upon their relations cantankerous kinfolks, be damned
If they can't accept us then we gonna scram

(Can't hide the way that I'm feeling for you
My emotions can't be concealed, I was in love
And together you and I will show the world, I wanted him to be the only one
Our love is for real, I was in love)

The past is an illusion, there is only now, now
A brief intermission, there is only now
Of this there is no question, there is only now
And if I get too lifted, would you hold me down?

Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirty dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one
Bet she pay what she weigh
I’m looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way

And show you 'bout some freaky shit that you ain't never knew about
Yes sir, you know I heard all about you
I'm here to re-route you, need to see what that mouth do
Virgin-a-listic, imperialistic
I got a t-shirt full of your lipstick
Go down, boo, go ahead and kiss it
I'm about to explode and don't you miss it
A whole mouth full, don't be scared and don't be bashful
One more question that I must ask you
Do you like or love it when I smash you?
Bring your girlfriends cause you have to

See a fly bitch, had a Porsche, U-turnin'
Dropping off, picking off, baby, get my digits up
Buy her a [?] now maybe you can visit her
About to finish her, you fucking free her
I pick her up, switch her to a Benz from a Kia
And I don't need her, I put money before divas
That's how I'm rocking fur, somebody run tell PETA
Who cares? New Airs, [?] for the public
What I rap about I really got, look and judge it
I'm like the Jim Morrison without the chorus in
Type of cat to drink til I black, wake up and pour again
It's war again, Benz 550's what we touring in

I'm pimping without the limp, what's the pasta without the shrimp?
What's the chopper without the inf, never pop up without my mink
It's waist lift, most y'all niggas is straight simps
And I don't deal with change unless it's gon' make sense
I'm finessing this great [?] and I ain't gotta drive it
A million in wardrobe and I ain't got a closet
And we flying private, first class even
Thirst cash season, first class heathens
I'm a violent pimp, I slap til my palm hurt
All you see is some blood, a track and a convert
A long hearse if you skimming of the top
I'm big pimping like Hov with women on the yacht
Ten linen on the [?], rims spinning on the drop
A hundred on the band, hand spinning on the watch
Clam dinners on the spot

Take ten pictures, let of a hollow

Felt his palm, he had no pulse
Could've been the drank, it might've been the smoke
In light of all that he was considered dope

It ain't like I don't love her, already gave her that ring
I hope you know, hope you know, how much I really wanna change
Why would I wanna wake up in the morning without you by my side?
And why do I gotta see you in tears just to make a nigga realise?

Now I got problems with my BM
I ain't wanna be him

But doin' better, and knowin' better and showin' better
Dumb shit in these streets and doin' what I want
When I should be doin' what made you put me on
Your ? smart, you got your own everything
Million niggas want you but I'm the one you're drawn to
Been through it all but you still hold me down
Got pain in your smile and you refuse to frown
Baby I'm sorry I embarrassed you

Your voicemail full but the text said read
I pray to God our love ain't dead baby I swear

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
Can't get caught again 'cause I swore that I was gon' change
Got me working overtime in my phone changing all these names
But the city so small, they probably end up talking
And if she finds out, she'll probably end up walking
But I'mma take my chances to gamble either way
And why would I wanna start over when I got you at home?

So you raise up and don’t ever let you down
All you got to do is mob without a frown
Just keep rising let your body be your fall
Like you was suppose to do from the very start

Just free your mind from all the negativity
And let the force come through you and me
Just ease your mind from all negativity
And let the force come through you and me

So you go on about your merry way
Why these fools talk behind your back everyday
Just get the raise up and show them the way

Then your next move is to rise from the light above
And kick rocks to darkness cause you had enough
So get on up now and do it for yourself
Stay away from the lames and the in day cause they always fail

Just free your mind from all the negativity
And let the force come through you and me
Just ease your mind from all negativity
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity 

So it’s the first day at your brand new spanking job
When you get there, you shake hands with your boss
And the whole day’s cruising to the next month too
But you soon realize that you’re working with fools
They sit up and gossip all day about other folks
And that’s what you didn’t come to get that dollar for
So you raise up and tell yourself one thing
Just think now you don’t gotta usher in change

Just free your mind from all the negativity
And let the force come through you and me
Just ease your mind from all negativity
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity 

To find a way
I dig it
Find a way
Can you dig it
Find a way
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity
Just free your mind from all the negativity
And let the force come through you and me
I suggest we find a way to break our negativity",Just Ease Your Mind From All Negativity,2015

Snoop Dogg,"Hello, how can I help you?
Hi, my name’s Dave Burd, I have an appointment today
It’s probably under 'Lil Dicky,' actually
I’m a, I’m a rapper, so
Okay, and who are you here to see?
Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here Snoop D-o-g-g
Oh, yeah. He’s right down the hall
First door to your right
Give him a knock and he should be right with you
Thanks. It’s uh, this door right here, right?
Mm-hmm, thank you

Grab a seat
Thanks I’m Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I’m a big fan of the shit that y’all make
I can’t lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there’s a reason that we called, Dave
let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?, yeah

I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much
I wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain’t never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad
I’m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there’s something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my god, it’s the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It’s never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It’s kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypothetical's
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn’t do shit
And I don’t even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that’s my niche!
Don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed
That’s the target I’ll hit
And that’s the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don’t know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don’t mean any disrespect by that
I’m just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

So what are your biggest strengths?
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain’t nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright, alright, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I’m pretty damn clever (go)
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (oh)
You can say I’m pretty smart how I know better
And y’all been winning like Pistorius, it’s no feat
Bro, I can go on and on
I’m taking over and they mad like father-in-laws
Okay enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don’t know if they can run it like that
But ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap
What’s that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?, I don’t get it
Nah it ain’t like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like, as a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain’t finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?
Yeah, I guess. So what you trying to do?
Five years from now, tell me bout the due
Well, I don’t care about the money
Like, it’s the respect that I’m wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don’t wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what’s your legacy?
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain’t mad at that
Well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I’mma rap the plaques
And I ain’t about to win them back to back
I’m bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain’t even sold a damn album yet, true
That’s a lot of talk from a wily vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain’t a book nigga
Well that’s one of my flaws, I’m too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain’t done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I’m like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don’t know if it’s your worst shit
You don’t think finding out would be worth it?
It might be, it might not
But I’mma put your ass to work, kid
Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together
What would you do for the hook for this song?
You want me to make a hook up right now?
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
Alright, uh, okay, man do the hook

I’m bout to be professional
Homie, I’m professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?
Nigga, that shit is garbage man
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah, you know, I’m just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?
Right now?
Yeah, sure

Dope, Juanita, bring some weed in here, please, thank you
(You got it, Snoop, I’ll be right there)
Thanks, Juanita, super nice woman
Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?
Uh, I really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so
Whatever, Thanks
(Hey, I got y’all y’all weed)
Damn, that’s some great looking weed, It’s just so early
(Can I get you guys anything else while I’m here? coffee? tea? head? bottled water?)
D-Did you just say head?
(Yeah. You ain’t never got no head before?)
I mean, Just feels like A lot, right now (ok)

But what kind of tea do you guys have?
(We got mint, raspberry, earl grey, English breakfast)
Actually, I’ll take head
(I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head.)",Professional Rapper,2015
Snoop Dogg,"Have I told you how good it feels to be me when I’m in you?

The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for

But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey

Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes

The struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
And life came with a couple of spills

Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing into the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree

I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up

Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece, man, your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song

Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused

There's always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled 
There's always some bitch on the side line talkin' shit with her big mouth

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not have heard or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
'Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't, wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horse's mouth
Right then and there, we can straighten it out
Cause I don't get involved with he said, she said

Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pebbles overheard her talking to her mam
Pebbles told Cookie what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from crew town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now

They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
'Cause all my teachers and doctors were purists to the fullest

Radio, TV, and even the press
They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out
Now when you established and got a lot of money
Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
(Here comes the vapors)
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She had a big Herringbone with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, ""Baby please, you out here serving stress""
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he sport boots that match with his suits
Push a Lexus Coupe, that's extra cute
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these
She caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors (we checkin' papers)
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (she got the flavour)
They caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's calm and plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be like ""Can I borrow a dollar, whoop, you a star now!
They caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors (D-A-Z checkin' papers)
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors

Now, I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said ""Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted""
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like ""Warren, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors (Warren G is makin' paper)
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (yeah, they caught the vapors)
They caught the vapors

I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Pound
I saw a crew on two-one street and said, ""Can I be down champ?""
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MC's straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
""Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to sit down back in the day""
It happens all the time, so nigga don't be amazed
You caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (Doggy Dogg boy, I'm makin' paper)
They caught the vapors (yeah, haha, he caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors (my niggas on top, we makin' paper)
They caught the vapors (take me out, ok?)

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors 
They caught the vapors, yes

Made it out the hole, almost ended off the road
Now I'm on and out the road state to state doing shows
Came a long way from kicking doors, stealing n**** bowls

And walkin' to the store
Now I might pull up in a roll when you walkin on more
Whoever knew that the streets did take me this far
Used to rock G shocks now I might rock the rollie or flaunt that Audemar
Bosses be the magic used to make Paris
Now I got Houston just to order seafood salad

Snoozegod As Oliver,"Clean up the dungeon, the king is home
You know he's gonna wanna hear another sing-along
Bring the crown downstairs and the blingy rope
Hood sort of jewels, man, he can't leave them things alone
He said the crown looks mush, is he wrong?
Doesn't matter, grapes on the platter
I was with the princess last night
After the Mad Hatter got mad at her
Man, I don't want the throne, the woman's a disaster
I'm just tryna bag her a couple more times
Then I'll give her back, he can have her
Here, help me with the ladder

I've been feeling under pressure, baby
Got me feeling these feels inside
I've been feeling under pressure, baby
Got me feeling these feels inside

I'ma have to ride this horse 'til springtime
Shoulda never drank all the king's wine
'Cause when I woke up, I was still wearing my wig
I walked down the hall
Saw the king's head, it was next to the pig's, crown and all
And guess what? The blood's on my saber
Ha, see you later
If I don't disappear, they gonna put me in charge of this shit
And I just wanna play my guitar for this bitch
Oh yeah, I took the princess, too
She's a Stage 5 clinger
Probably thinks I'ma give her a ring-a on her finger
But fuck that shit
All these princess bitches just wanna fuck a singer, a singer
And the singer just wants to sing, fuck, I'm gettin' tired
My saddle's too small and my legs are on fire
I haven't eaten in days, I wanna go home
This bitch drank all my wine and there's no smoke
And I know, and I know that your family's all dead
But what the fuck were they feeding you?
Hog heads? Fat bitch
Matter fact, get off the horse
Yeah, I'll be right back
I'm on my own now with the stupid horse

Uh-huh, yeah, killed the king with that drunk singer's sword
Where's the princess? Oliver, bring her forward
The king had no sons, so now the throne's mine
Once I bag the princess, I'm in the bloodline
Talk to me Oliver
We searched up and down
The princess of Yore is nowhere to be found
Jack saw her leave at the crack of dawn, and guess what?
What? She was on the troubadour's arm
Now Oliver, you gotta be kidding me
Two nights ago, I fucked her 'til my dick broke
One night, one fight and she's gone, this a sick joke?
And for a muhfuckin' singer? Oh no, oh no
I'm the Mad Hatter, if she ain't fuckin' with me
Then nobody else can have her
I'ma find him if it even means searchin' all of Liverpool
Tie a horse to each limb, and let 'em pull
Ha, giddy up

There he is, I see him
We meet again, where's the woman?
I left her 20 miles back in the mountains
I'd be very surprised if she's still alive
Going up Peter's Past this time of year would be ill advised, ill advised
Honestly, I didn't love her, I only loved being alone
But I need her for the throne
Fuck the throne, man, it's too much work
People hanging on every single goddamn word
Enough, tie him up, I got a idea right now (Huh?)
Give me a dagger, put a apple in his mouth
I ain't gonna leave you here to starve out
I'ma slice your fingers off, play guitar now
Take his little tambourine, too, what's he gonna use it for?

Before too long
Your number's up
Now you are
GONE
(and thrown away the key)

Jails, institutions
and DEATH
(think I'm fucking kidding?)

Now it feels just like a dream
But it's not what it seems
Gotta block out the screams
I'm too tired to defend
Bring my life to an end
This I can't comprehend
But it's coming
Now the needle's in my neck
I know that mine is not
The only life I've wrecked
Now that I know the battle can't be won
Selfishness weighs a ton
Lookin' out for number one
As if my life was so pretty
Now things look shitty
And there's no one to save me from
Fuckin' pain
It burns hot from the inside out
Now there ain't no doubt
How this bout started out

Now they've finally brought me down
Sympathy can't be found
Locking doors the only sound
I've screwed over all who care
It's only fair
They've stripped my soul bare
I can't take it
Now it starts to come on strong
The long arm of the law
Coming down on my head
It's been so long
Since I have felt the sun beating down from above
Without bars on my cage reminding me
That I got screwed up
And I've got no love
>From a truck
What the fuck
I'll keep truckin' down
I'm locked in this cell
Kickin' it in hell
Ain't no joke the straight dope started out

(Locking doors the only sound)

Jails, institutions
and DEATH
(think you can take your pick?)

Kickin' dope in a jail cell
You want to die it feels like hell
Muscles ache you cannot sleep
Stomache ache you cannot eat
Do your time and make parole
Now you're free
Out of this hole
Think you'd learn and start to cope
But from the gate you score some dope

Nothing changes
You start to regress
You're all strung out
Life is a mess
Once again",Tecato,1997
Snot,"Break it, Bring it, Down there, ain't no room for us!

There ain't no room for us in your alternative nation.
Seems you've had control for way to long,yes,
Your greed and your dishonesty only add to my frustration,
Can't you see the powers that be,they don't give a fuck about you and me, 
Somebody better say this 'cause there ain't noboby tryin' to save us, Just enslave us, Leave us hangin by the rope that they just gave us, 

Victim of your mistrust
Liar

You, your dance, your stupid cash advance,
No, I'm not a victim of circumstance, 
Not gonna leave my life to chance.

You rape the hearts of us, the artist, 
You reap the benefits, 
Your pockets they get fat as our souls bleed.
Oh, your gettin away with murder,""Son you failed to read the fine print."" 
Labeled whores like festering sores,

Don't you know they've got a deal for you, 
No, it's not enough just to hate this.
'Cause we know the ones in charge are so 
Shameless and wasted energy on the hate defeats our purpose,

Victim of your mistrust,

Now what you got ta do you need ta Stop and read betwwen the lines, 
behind that smile the greed still shows in their eyes, 
That's part of their disguise, Don't believe the lies, 
Don't believe the lies, Don't believe...

The more I learn about your game the less I wish to be involved with you another day,

Get out of my life
Ah yea, Just where do we fit in It looks like we'll never win and with the next big trend, ah the cycle starts again...

That's how we bring it down, ain't no room for us,

Don't let them turn you 'round
And fall out of trust
You've got to take control,
Don't let em have it
They've got to work for us,
Don't let them forget
They've got to earn the trust",Unplugged,1997
Snot,"Well now it seems more than silence has been broken
And I think I've figured out the the dying lie
Yes the truth is that your dialect is half truth
Another conversation died alone

This is something we created
Yes, well the sufferment's abated
It doesn't have to be a prophecy
We could be both seeking destiny

It's fucking down to us and them
You can decide which one wins
Now's the time, are you the hunter or the hunted?

Absent - Sometimes it feels like it's us against them
Absent, sometimes it feels like their angers are justified
If it feels like I'm absent... from your conversation
Just keep on talking and you'll find out... You're probably right

Now it seems that there are no easy answers
To the same old question I've imposed
What does it mean? Why would you bother asking me?
Like it's something I should know

Just 'cause they paid me to take it
I guess their money gave me credence
Watch our records soar
As you slow down to buy the accident - SO SICK!!

Know that I'll pull your covers, bitch
Yes I'm fixin' to knock that ego down
Well I might slap you punk ass to the floor
Stupid motherfucker, nothin' but a buster
Still talkin' shit!

Devoid of soul, so ya dig yourself a hole
Take the fun out, I load the gun for you
Incorrect, cause and effect, you've been sold
Live in the wrong, so ya live in the lies
Take the fun, load the gun, incorrect, cause and effect

I don't care
Yes you're probably right

Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps draggin on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me cryin'
You know inside I feel like dying
And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find somone to please you
Somone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you

Snow,"[Big Pokey]
You're trippin' me out, sho' nuff
When you stroll up, you make niggas fold up
Hold up, I been peepin' your ways
Plus the pedal pushers and braids got my mind in a daze
You look sweeter than glaze
Make me want to misbehave
But you playin' hard to get
You gotta run a trick play
Flea flickers, steady buying shots of liquor
All dogs chase the cat, so it's a must; I sick her
Hand picker, pretty face, and toes
Check complexion and pose
See the chosen be chose
Then I turn up your nose
You been chose by a bachelor
I just had to distract you for a minute, and holler at ya
It's mandatory I snatch her 
'Cause the statues'll knock at ya
Spend some time with Po-yo
'Cause I ain't hard to adapt to
If you have to, just give it some thought
See what I'm about
Ain't no fusion, no doubt
Can't lie; you're trippin' me out

[Chorus]
Trippin' me out, trippin' me out
Oh, she's trippin' me out
Got me sayin' hold up
Trippin' me out, trippin' me out
Oh, she's trippin me out 
Got me sayin' hold up

[Snow]
What me and you have stay strictly 'bout the cash
Not only 'bout the ass
That's how I got this S-class
I got my own cash, and I watch my own ice
Peeped the real in me, huh? 
That's why you looked twice
Vision Snow in your life, holdin' you tight
Relievin' your stress as I caress you through the night
I'm the go-get-it type
To make sure we both right
No fuss, no fight, and we can blow like dynamite
With you handlin' your buisiness and me handlin' mine
With us both on the grind, we can't help but to climb
As far as time, baby, we got forever
But for right now, let's concentrate on this cheddar
And reaching higher levels, sportin' diamond bezzles
Can you imagine the shit we can have together?
Me trippin'? Never; I'm down for whatever
Snow and Po-yo - it don't get no better

[Chorus]

[Big Pokey]
I ain't trippin'; I'm just stunned 'cause you the bomb
I could see us in a six, flippin' like a baton
You set off my alarm
When you walk you perform
Spotted you in the crowd and picked you like a pecan

[Snow]
Well, let's hop this don and discuss how we increase our funds
I know it drives you crazy when I talk in digits, baby
Ain't nothin' shady about this, lady
Everything is everything, and I put it down for you daily

[Big Pokey]
You got me fallin', baby
On top of that, I can hear your body callin', baby
In the Impala, so you know I'm boss ballin', baby
Steady crawlin', and the motor ain't stallin', baby
It's all gravy
On sight, you hooked me
When you spoke, you shook me
First impressions be a trip, and you immediately took me
I'm far from a rookie; star status of course
You the glass on the blaze, driving me like a torch
That's why I want you by my side, so I can flaunt you
You don't want a square
You want a thug nigga, don't you?
Let's bend us a corner
Scratch off in the night
And everything's gonna be alright
It's goin' down

[Chorus]",Trippin Me Out,1999
Snow,"I've been here before
It only made me cry
I felt so sure
I never questioned why
Till I woke up alone
That's why I have to ask you
Baby what's behind your kiss
I need to know your heart's in this

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the kind of love
That is strong enough
To walk through anything
So don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
I only want to play for keeps
want to fall in deep
If you don't just say goodbye
Don't waste my time

The words you say
Are what I want to hear
Promises you make
Are music to my ears
Is it the heat of the moment talking
Promises come easily
Give me something to believe

AKA Snow 
And when I let you go 
You got a hardway 
Hard long and stiff 
But that's only if 
You decide to riff and get flipped 
Flipped like a hooker 
Paid full in time 
I'm known to design 
I sing, chant and rhyme 
The week that I trample 
So here's an example 
I am ample - yes I am ample 
Swift with the tongue 
My new style of drum 
I got real busy like a bee and then I stung 
Well changing up the styles 
And into the piles 
Swinging through the files 
Cause I'm a

You know I'm here to go

Ya stand tippy-toe because 
All the talk no jokin' talk no all the talk for me 
All the talk no jokin' talk no all the talk for me 
Now what did I do 
Now what did I train 
I'm often can't get me own 
But leave every time we go because of spiritual ???? it goes 
All the talk no jokin' talk no all the talk for me 
At the dance the women DJ come for free 
Now me say hush up your mouth 
No bigger keep sighing little lord 
The fun that I beat them up enough argument 
Now what me gonna do am I gonna get violent 
And gonna come down my house and them tear down my fence 
A kicked a ball through my window 
This is something that you mustn't really know because 
All the talk no jokin' talk no all the talk for me 
All the talk no jokin' talk no all the talk for me 
Lord have mercy

Snow,"Here's a real sad song 
A song that must be sung 
Think about the days when we were young 
When we were kids girl all you wanted to do was play 
But that was then and look at how you're living today 
It's making me sad and almost brings me tears 
But you may just open your eyes when the smoke clears 
Girl what happened to the smile that used to clean 
Once upon a time in your life you used to dream 
At the top of the swim team but now you're drownin' 
How quick your change was the most astounding 
What you're gonna do is you against the world 
You started off being such a sweet girl 
Times go by, and years they start to drift 
Now you're staring down a deep cliff 
You can pour but don't overflow the cup 
Girl you better 

CHORUS 
Ease up 
So down 
Girl you better change your life around (ease up) 
So down (ease up) 
So down 
Girl you better change your life around (ease up) 
So down 

No longer kids now we're considered as teens 
Now we start learning what the letters in life mean 
You had a good home living the good life - who knows 
You might have made somebody a good wife 
How is it wrong when things which are so fun 
Now you walk around with a body with no mind 
You entered the gateway to all life choices 
Your brain was kinda hollow so you followed the voices 
And you let it mislead ya 
It took your body and soul and it said that it freed ya 
Each and every girl like you is a sad case 
You always have a beautiful look on a sad face 
It could never be the way that it was 
But if you're on the dope then that's what the dope does 
If you pour don't overflow the cup 
Girl you better 

[CHORUS ]
And now it comes to the final solution 
Robbing and stealing and prostitution 
Can't you see that your world is a shamble? 
Life is a big game with plenty of gambles 
So much time many things that are undone 
No longer you cause there's you and a young son 
You got one there are girls with two or three 
Can't get a fix on 'em it's driving 'em up a tree 
Just stop and think of your young child 
Before he winds up as a name in a closed file 
As I reminisce and take a look back 
I wish I knew what to do to put you on the right track 
But yet the train that left the station 
And your money's on a permanent vacation 
The more you pour you overflow the cup 
Girl you better 

[CHORUS]",Ease Up,1993

How they'd never-ever seen to get along
And pretending it don't hurt you
But the clouds told me somethings wrong...
(she didn't want to say)

Wanted a life that could not be
But she would fake it
Until she would make it
Still all this time, it's been killing me
So we sing...
Ooo-ahh-na-na-na...

I can see the sadness in your eyes, oh my...
I can see the teardrops crying why, oh why...",Cinco de Mayo (Intro),2002

She a born and she raised to keep dem mon hungry
Body shape, hair cut like Halle Berry
Fool of the mon that try to come tame this sassy
What she want is a man who can handle her right
All through the night, baller for life
Well I can smash it up
And I can love it up
But only girl if you want to give it up

Can I get that

You can find her shiny teeth at any corner
Nice and ready for da man who want spend him dollar
So soon as she see Snow she wasn't spend me dollar
So we jump in da whip and headed to the crib
Then she started to express how she like that informer
She said I'll nice it up then I'll love it up
But when da Laura through you'll have to pay it up

Sit back shut your mouth I got something to say
Everything I used to do I'm gonna change today
Why you only call me when you need my car

Why'd you freeze me, then you leave me 
When you weren't even groovin' on me 
Don't want to scrub off this feeling 
Don't want to rub off this feeling

I go to see my girl, my Madonna
I've been so lonely, I've been thinkin' 'bout you

[Latoya and Miranda]
It never fails, no matter what I do
I find myself locked up in thoughts of you
Over your kiss, I reminisce by sweet sunlight
And it's your titanic touch, that takes my mind at night
Cause when I'm with you love is so real it's like sweet pain
Just the thought of you takes away the rain
There's nothing I'd rather do than keep you on my mind
Days are short enough, so I don't waste my time
Locked up in you, your love is true, what am I to do?
want to make this real, 'bout how I feel, boy what's the deal?
Your love is so real, you got me, you got me

I don't tie knots, why not? that ain't my thing (foo')

Pop the cork and, rearrange and stop your walkin'

When I rise, I lay it down, bless it and leave

That's what you get for stopin'

Won't put up a fight

What can I do?
You know you've got that butter love
I'm thinkin' of, baby you stay on my mind

Just say yes, 'cause I'm aching and I know you are too
For the touch of your warm skin
As I breathe you in

I can feel your heart beat through my shirt
This was all I wanted, all I want
It's all I want

Wake up to your window
The day calls in billows

Call me on time
And well go over to nanas place disgracefully
Fall into line
There's the garden grave and a place they've saved for you
I'll fall by your side

I'm not trying to indicate my state of mind. 
I turn you on, 
I tell you that I'm laughing just to keep from crying 
Pretty music when you hear it, 
Keep on trying to get near it.
A little rhythm for your spirit 
Oh but that's what it's for 
Come on in, here's the door

And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I

Now here's a mystery 
And maybe you can help to make it clear to me 
When you're fast asleep 
Then what is it that's lighting up the dreams you see 
Only your tears can't conceal it 
And only your prayers may not reveal it 
You've got soul so you can feel it 
And when you make the scene 
Well you know what I mean 

Hey, I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I

Down here on the ground 
When you find folks are giving you the runaround 
Keep your game uptight 
And if you must just take your secrets underground 
Now politicians are trying to speech you 
Mad color watchers are trying to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you 
If you're lost in a stack 
That's OK, come all black

Now I'd be the last to deny 
That I'm just an average guy 
And don't you know each little bird in the sky 
Is just a little bit freer than I

Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so 
What they think is real 
Is nothing but an animated puppet show

And don't let name and form abuse you 
Let that Big Joe Williams blues you

As the night rolls us up in its arms
And the square of your thumbs and your fingers
Is the blanket of the sky that's so warm

That the day hasn't shown all its cards
Now it's out to the stars of the ocean
Let's not retrace our steps to the car

Picking out all the stars that we like
Between finger and thumb
You laugh as you pass me the night
As if it's too fragile to hold
And I hold it so close to my chest
With your hands in my hands
You say this is just how we'll rest
Until light turns to sound

Now your eyelids they faint and they shiver
Like the wings of the last bird to leave
For the south for the heat for no reason
I watch as they fly for sheer joy

The wind shakes the branches above us
And the car shaved the ground at our backs
But the dark roman wine in our bloodstreams
Makes the cold just a word, just a sound

Picking out all the stars that we like
Between finger and thumb
You laugh as you pass me the night
As if it's too fragile to hold
And I hold it so close to my chest
With your hands in my hands
You say this is just how we'll rest
Until the light turns to sound",Dark Roman Wine,2009

She told me she ready for anything, I’m talkin' anything
I stuck it up in her jaws, I’m breakin' walls, like I was Katrina
Don’t even know me, but she know my flow is O.G.
She told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely
Homie if I was only right there instead of a sony
You claimin' the pussy wet, but dont tell me baby, just show me
She ask if I’m comin' up with the mask in my entrance
Sinner in a second real spitter like every sentence
She was there for repentance, ever since i was an infant
I’m damagin' the vagina, remind you I’m filled with vengeance
Hit 'em whenever they ever wanna run up
And they doin' it cause I rap and shit
I really don’t care, whatever it takes, to get 'em up on the mattress
I could have been the one that’s huntin run for bustin a gun
But this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses
In bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini
She told me she wanna be me while sippin' Apple Martinis
Fuck it if I'm a meanie she probably would never leave me
Shit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie
And now I see 'em on every record and stage

Snow tha Product,"You know, and it gets into this whole issue of border security
You know, who's gonna say that the borders are secure? 
We've got the House and the Senate debating this issue
And it's, it's really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants
""Immigrant"" has somehow become a bad word 
So the debate rages on and we continue

And just like that it's over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom
Not yet

I got one job, two job, three when I need them
I got five roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them
And we all came America trying to get a lap dance from Lady Freedom
But now Lady Liberty is acting like Hilary Banks with a pre-nup
Man, I was brave, sailing on graves
Don't think I didn't notice those tombstones disguised as waves
I'm no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant without risking your lives
Or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies
All you got to do is see the world with new eyes

It's a hard line when you're an import
Baby boy, it's hard times

I'll outwork you, it hurts you
You claim I'm stealing jobs though
Peter Piper claimed he picked them, he just underpaid Pablo
But there ain't a paper trail when you living in the shadows
We're America's ghost writers, the credit's only borrowed

Na they don't play British empire strikes back
They beating us like 808's and high hats
At our own game of invasion, but this ain't Iraq
Who these fugees what did they do for me
But contribute new dreams
Taxes and tools, swagger and food to eat
Cool, they flee war zones, but the problem ain't ours
Even if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower
Buckingham Palace or Capitol Hill
Blood of my ancestors had that all built
It's the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill
Thin red lines on the flag you hoist when you kill
But still we just say ""look how far I come""

Words glow and fade as the meanings change

Decisions just float on by

And reflects back off to the stars
A final witness to a dying sunset

Snug Brim,"Love in a vacuum, love in a space,
Love without even the little hint of a trace,
Love in confusion then love doesn't show on your face.

Love is a stranger, love is a box,
Love is the key that fits a million locks,
Love is a mystery when love is the devil you call.

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine.

Love at a distance, love at a walk,
Love at the limit if only people could talk,
Love for the moment it takes to its wings like a hawk.

Love for tomorrow, love for today,
Love for the hour it could be coming your way,
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play.

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.

I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,

I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.

Girl, as I sit here thinking to myself 
There is no one for you but me, and I mean that
And I think about all the things we've been through 
Like arguing and fighting for example
You know the love we have for each other

The niggas from the eastsidaz split up (split up)
And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up (what?)

That I would be bigger the Kurtis blow

Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm gettin' cake 
To realize your fate through faith, (through faith)
Cause we all gonna get that day (for what)
To see if our lives was straight
And to see if we gonna walk through those pearly gates (yeah?)

Hey man, niggas tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
And Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the snipers?
Man I'm talking about us and every motherfucking body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up coming to you
Snipers and do or die, rap-a-lot mafia
From the chi, here it go like this

I went from zip locks and baking soda
To smoking herb, cooking 'ola
Never looking overnight success
Cause I want a rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scene like po-po's
In the four door chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop snipers snap a lot
Putting down with rap-a-lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to chi

Ain't no success even if you crying for it
Them niggas alive know it, they dying for it
Even them niggas that kill, get caught, and strive for it
I strive for it
That's why I sixteen years and a positive
Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm taking it
See niggas faking it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't making it

Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalking from the end of my ? gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the snipers ? knew ya
Stressed out, had me feeling left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since ? to non-believers, overnight

[Chorus: x2]
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight

Living it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See ? got a death wish
But do or die and snipers , represent chi-town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doing this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells goin' drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from rap-a-lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, do or die, pick a piece snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart

So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight

Coming down
Ice cream and a towel wrapped around
Flowing hair that swallows me
Follows me down

It's okay
Twisted sheets and endless rainy days
Channels flash across your face

So Elated,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2008

Quando não a encontrei

Dont screw up your face all bent
All your doin is refunding me
For all of the raving money i spent
That was to pay rent
Haterz dont go and be like that
Screwing up your face in the dark
Dont let me get dark
Dont let me go in the boot of my car 
Thats in the car park

Ladies chill
Take your Monday pill
Please dont grill
Romeos on the mic and im still
Keeping it real
Until
I make a mill-
-llion of the pounds them
With my lyrical sounds them
Turn up the speaker then
'Cause i wanna go deeper then-a
Let me go deeper then

I wanna go
Back in the days when i never had nothing then
Never had enough money to buy all the sweets in the shop
So i put back some of them
Life was harder then
Hey afro, never go barber then
Grew up in a single parent family
Without no father then
So my mum took up harder then

On a scale of 1 to 10
Mum gets 10
Shes like one of the ravers them
up there chilling in V.I.P with her friend X2
Dont bother them then

Clips and we bust like a firing line of duty
It's on this year
Better beware
Clips and we bust like a firing line of duty

Don't give me no bullshit
Hesitant never step to the clique
With a droll like yo and the ice style clips
And the ice on my wrist
Ya'll haters ain't shit
So Solid's my clique
And we're making the hits
And we're making you sick
And we're spitting the bricks
With a thoughtless eclipse

So many haters are clocking our figures
So many haters don't like us rakin' papers
But all we did was bring garage through
From the underground straight to you
Used to want to screw and bawl
Now they want to join the crew...",Haters,2001
So Solid Crew,"crikey!
So solid
Oxide, G-man, Lisa Maffia, MAC
crikey!

To my niggaz, kinda figures
With their fingers, on the triggers
To my niggaz, kinda figures
With their fingers, on the triggers
To my niggaz, kinda figures
With their fingers, on the triggers
To my niggaz, kinda figures
With their fingers, on the triggers

Yo I'm spittin', if it ain't said then it's written
I fight my mother for the flows that I'm givin'
Never give in, bust shows never missin'
Mad shots to ya chest, learn a lesson
Your mother's at home and she's sweatin' and she's frettin'
Talk to the Feds, then she's missin'
Say my name, then she's missin'
Spoil my game, then she's missin'
I'm gonna get 'er when she cookin' in the kitchen
At night, in her bed when she kippin'
My gun's rippin', yo there's no slippin'
My gun's rippin', yo there's no slippin'
When I'm blazin' I'm grazin'
Burnin' bodies like raisins
Puttin' bodies in basements
And your crew is erasin'
Well white domination
So solid amazin'

I know what's comin' though, it's more dough
Flossin' my clique, spittin' my flows
This is my dough, my flow's
Keepin' niggaz on their knees and tha bitches on their toes
You see my dough, uh no no
First lady lettin' all'v her chicks dem know
Dem know, dem know
Keepin' niggaz on their knees and tha bitches on their toes
