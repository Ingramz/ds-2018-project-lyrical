I, I will wash over you
I know your heart is true
Little Mountain of mine
?Cause the sun set down on me
You turn your head and slowly start to breathe
Like the common bonds on carbon, buried deep
I?m the shadow of the long forgotten dream
But I, I will wash over you
I know your heart is true
Little mountain of mine
But every word I wrote left incomplete
And the promises I never got to keep
Though you toes grow colder as you sleep
The blood runs through your heart with every beat

I know your heart is true

And for all the fruit that bore your seed
There's a wet worm waiting by your feet
By your feet by your feet
There's another apple you don't eat
And oh I curse the weight of me
The heavy purse drug at your heels
And the dead straight line that pulled you in
Got tangled in our spiral spin
In our spin in our spin
The tangle that I left you in
And all the love I thought we had
A tire tread that slips when wet

About your flirting ways, & it hurts me so to hear

There's alot of things I want, a lot of things that I'd like to be.
But girl, I don't forsee  a rags-to-riches story for me.
There's just one little dream I've got to come true;
There's just one round I've gotta win,
I can't be a loser with you.
 
Baby, baby, Once In My Life, let me get what I want,
Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
Cause I couldn't face a day if you weren't here by my side.
If you went away then I'd be left without any pride.
I've given up on schemes, 'Cause all of them fell through,
I've given up so many things, Don't ask me to give up on you.
 
Baby, baby, Once In My Life, let me get what I want,
Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find,
But if you stand by me, I'll keep my peace of mind.
I can't give you the world, But I I'll work hard for you, girl.
I'll work hard, ev'ryday, all my life. 
So baby, please don't leave me, just do this for me.

but fun is a bore and with money I'm poor.

Someone just remind her 'bout this love she left behind her.

inclined to find her, inclined to find my baby.

You miss being kissed by this lyrical treasure
Enjoy it at your leisure, cause it's gonna please ya

And you'll catch a stroke
And say, ""Damn, that brother broke!""
Now I'm about to get off another funky hit off
And if you think you're hangin, yo, I think you bit off
More than you can chew, now how you gonna swallow it?

Now I'm the capital A and what I'm sayin is conveyin
That I romp, stomp and jump on any competition
That's opposed to me, they can't get close to me
You say that goes to see, what's that supposed to be?
Some kind of challenge? I take you head up
Beat up and eat up punks and won't let up
But not with my fist or even with a deadly weapon
But with my lyrics, yeah, that's how I'm steppin
On all those that doubt me or my race is won
And you critics are hopin that the Ace is done
But now consider, this here little bit of
Super commentary for those that are very
Misdirected and lookin for some kinda angle
Censorship is their attempt to strangle
The Master, they know that my words can motivate
And set straight the crooked from their fate
Don't you understand that rap is like a tool to me
You're sellin what? You're actin likea fool to me
Go get a job or maybe go and learn a trade
And make the grade, that's how you get paid
Steady's on the cut and Action is the posse
Open your eyes and you'll see what I see
Brothers are fallin, homegirls are callin
Themselves independent, but yo, we're all in
The same boat together, it doesn't matter whether
You disagree, it's still reality - see

[ VERSE 3: Master Ace ]
Now where're we goin, where are we goin, which direction?
Look at your reflection, now someone praise the resurrection
Of a people many years considered kin
To an animal, unlike those with lighter skin
But that's the past and many knew it couldn't last
By peaceful means or either by a rifle blast
Or whatever, better late than never
We finally arrived and yo, the dream has survived
But many died tryin and they're the ones that paved the way
Real live supermen and -women save the day
So that we can live our life without ?????

So realize what it took for us to rise
And don't sleep but reap and keep your eyes on the prize

Sing a song of six pence, a pocket full of crack
Think you're sayin somethin, you ain't sayin jack

From what I'm seein lately I'd say crime pays
Cause somebody is gettin paid
I think it's time to sprinkle some rain on the parade
Now listen, take this as a word from the wise
I'm not a prophet or a preacher, just a man with eyes
And I've been witnessed the fitness of a neighborhood worsen
You oughta hold a person-to-person
Discussion with those who rose from that level
Usin a broom or a mop or a shovel
Not on the corner waitin for the big pay-off
It's not comin, so why not stay off
The streets, believe me it beats bein sent up-
state on a date with the man and bein pinned up
In solitary, take advantage of your freedom
I'm givin helpful hands cause you need em
It's not all about the cash you make
Sellin poison to boys and girls - you're a fake
So what you got a cable, so what you got a BM?
You love when the girls go, ""Ooh, did you see him!""
So what your pocket's filled with 20s and 10s
You're gonna find out just how fast that ends
Cause one day you'll be drivin round the way in your ride
There'll be a bullet with your name on the side
And if you don't believe what I'm tellin you, mack

(Okay, I'm loosin up now)
(Aw - there it is!)

(I've waited long enough)
Bust a move, let's play a little Simon Says
So take your places and listen to the rhymin as
I like display a new style that just may
Leave suckers runnin for the door in total dismay
Yeah, by now, so you're startin to
Get a little hype, but first get a partner
And proceed full speed right to the dance arena
I really doubt it, but maybe by chance you seen 
another brother more inclined to play the part of Simon
Than the Master Ace who knows the art of rhymin
Like a shark knows the finer points of swimmin
Like Steady Pace know the cuts and the fly women
And so before we start this game
Simon says: get up, and yo, I do the same

(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: look deep into your partner's eyes
(Let's play a little game)
Look at your partner from head to toe
(Let's play a little game)
And all those good parts in between, you know
(Let's play a little game)

Simon says: it gets badder, and you never had a
Beat that can heat your feet, and still add a
Theme with so much steam, it makes sweat pour
From your faces, and the Ace is sure
Gonna do it, as you listen to it
See, I navigate ya straight to help through it
I'm Simon, rhymin, climbin on time, and
On a mission, that's the position that I'm in
Takin you there, makin you care
I'm achin to tear up the floor, but I don't dare
Leave the mic sittin, gettin cold without my hand on
Those that dance don't have a foot to stand on
And those that don't dance, yo, you oughta know
Simon says: wall flowers aren't allowed to grow

(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: close your eyes
And imagine your partner totally unclothed
(Let's play a little game)
Nude, in the butt, bare to the flesh
Now get as close as you can to your partner
And without touching him, move your body to the rhythm
(Let's play a little game)

Simon takes the stand, just as planned
And I display in a ray that's rather grand
Now I agree, there are many who said 'party's off'
But if one of them says, he drops arty soft
See to drop hard you must have the kind of mind
That's refined and artistically lined
Cause yo, it takes nack if you want to attack
Attract with such skill, and still fit the bill
Ace and Action, few can come harder
Than we come, uhm - here's some, but only part of
The gift that can lift the myth that is swift
Only boast the most, yo, Simon says
If your partner's face is in place with your taste
Then haste, you better push up, no time to waste
So if you're with it, you better get it, don't try to sit it
On a chair and stare like a square, brother, quit it
There's no time for nerds and geeks, only freaks
With the sexy cheeks, as the Master speaks
And for weeks and weeks you will dance and prance
To the rhythm I enhance with my chants
So here's a glance at a jam that'll nullify
And fry all the rest, bust the color
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, in the gold and violet
This jam is fly, and I'm the pilot
Flyin you straight to the end of the rainbow
Steady and I try to open your brain, so
You can accept what was carefully kept
Till the fun stops, then the party was pepped
Up, and if you stepped up, you couldn't hold your place in a chair
So hail Simon, the brother Master Ace in the rear

Simon says: yeah
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: put your right hand on your partner's shoulder
And put your left hand on your partner's waist
(Let's play a little game)
Now move your hips rhythmatically
(Let's play a little game)
Now the climax
Simon says: touch your partner's body
Touch your partner's body
In every way imaginable
Yeah
Do the nasty

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

That it might as well be spring

With you--baby, baby.

Around back, underground, where the trees shield
In the corner of the yard, another death room
Where the dead are buried in an unmarked tomb

Stiff blue painted cat wired to the roof
Cyanide in the darkness and dangling goat hooves
Floor covered in dirt, dead grass, and decay

That once burned deep inside has blown away
And washed out with the rain

The tower of your faith has crumbled to the ground
Crushing those that held to you
And in your place, we dug a shallow grave
Hoping to see a change, a resurrection

And so we fight for the heart
Holding nothing back till we see the sun on the horizon
Bringing light to this barren wasteland, power of ages old
Held in the mighty hands of God
Pushed out and thrown away like a painful memory

Two feet in the grave we march relentlessly
Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation
Two feet in the grave we march relentlessly
Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation

The Afters,"Ready or not the years are blurring
Running away the mind is turning
Skip to the end to find the meaning
Thoughts are fading, yet I wonder still
Like it or not your eyes are open
Playing around, the circles going
Face of a child, your mind is old
The clock ran down before I could begin

[Chorus]
I wish we all could win
I wish we all could smile
I wish we all could make our mothers proud

Want it or not you can't just leave it
Throw it away, I can't believe it
Walking for days, I know you'll see that
Times are changing, soon we'll be the same

[Chorus]

Someday, someday, someday
You'll come around
Someday, someday, someday
Your time will come
There's nothing more that I can do
I know we all can make through
I hope that someday you will see

The Afters,"I lose myself to find in me
The way it really ought to be
It's hard to say I love you
It's hard to say I need you
If all is well it's hard to tell
It hurts to think of someone else
It's hard to say I'll be there
It's hard to say I really, really care

[Chorus]
Until the world won't turn
'Till the planets burn
Until the sun dies I'll be there
Until the heavens come
'Til this lie is done
Until the world dies I'll be there

I can't see outside myself
How can I love for someone else
It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to say forgive me
I can't believe you're here with me
Into the future I can't see
It's hard to say forever
It's hard to say I'll never ever go

The Afters,"Wait
Wait, I can hardly wait
To look into Your face
When the world disappears into Your eyes

Wait, I can hardly wait
To hear your sweet voice say
You've done well, my good and faithful son

Breathe, I can hardly breathe
In anticipation
Waiting for the day to come
When You will shine on me

Wait, I can hardly wait
To bow at Your feet
Kiss the scars that bore my sins away
I can hardly breathe In anticipation
Waiting for the day to come
When You will shine on me

And my spirit is as weak as a rose
See my sorrow, feel my pain
You're my refuge, You're my reason

You're in my heart, You're in my soul
You are my heaven, You're my home
You're my best friend, You're my true love
You are my treasure, You're my God

I watch as the mountains fall down
And the rivers part at your feet
Your creation sings Your praise
Even wings obey and angels bow down
At Your beautiful voice
That's where I find God

You're in my heart, You're in my soul
You are my heaven, You're my home

The Afters,"It was raining on the sun
The ground beneath my feet was crumbling
Day and Night had come undone
It was the season of my wandering

Somehow Somewhere
You found me there
It was the moment that it all became clear

I was on the edge
Of a distant world
A shattered life
With no where left to turn
Till I saw you there
And everything I thought had gone to waste
Was falling into place

It's finally quiet in my head
As I lay the pieces at your feet
It's finally starting to make sense
I guess I found the missing part of me

Oceans that I almost drowned in
I had to lose it all
Just so I could find out you were
There to break my fall

It was the season of my wandering

I was on the edge
Of a distant world
A shattered life
With no where left to turn
Till I saw you there
And everything I thought had gone to waste

The Afters,"There's a different sunrise
It's a different world

Once a life imprisoned
I was locked in the past
But your love has given
Given one more chance

You cannot know the sweetness of victory without first dwelling in the agony of defeat

Out in the night
On the kind of night
Where you want to be out
On the street, on the street
Crawling up the walls
Like a cat in heat

And the air is thin
And it blows through your skin
And you feel like something
Is about to begin
But you don't know what
And you don't know when
So you tear at your hair
And you scratch at your skin

You wanna run away, run away
Just get on the fucking train and leave today
And it doesn't matter where you spend the night
You just might end up somewhere in a fight, in a fight
Or caught in your room on a concrete shelf
Fighting all alone, with yourself, with yourself
And you just wanna feel like a coin that's been tossed
In a wishing well, a wishing well
A wishing well, a wishing well
Well, you're tossed in the air
And you fell and you fell
Through the dark blue waters
Where you cast your spell
Like you were just a wish that could turn out well

So you stand on the corner
Where the angels sit
And you think to yourself,
""This is it, this is it,
This is all that I have
All I can stand
Is this air in my lungs
And this coin in my hand
That you tossed in the air
And I fell, and I fell
All the way to the bottom

Like those soft little secrets
That you tell, that you tell
To yourself, when you think
No one's listening to, well""

And the mescaline
The threat of your brow
Under unmade sheets
In your ear with the noise
From the darkest streets

You screamed, you cried
You thought suicide was an alibi
But you were always a mess
You were always aloof
Yeah, it's awful, I guess
But it's the awful truth
It was truth from the first
To the last words that she read

And she emerged from the dark
Like a ghost in my head
She said, ""I haven't forgot

And I cry in my sleep
And I tear up your letters
And I burn them in heaps
And I gather the ashes

The same I always was?

Then we love to be loved
In the rush we become

Left weary and scared

The Airborne Toxic Event,"The other day when we were walking by the graveyard near the house
You asked me if I thought we would ever die
And if life and love both fade so predictably
We've made ourselves a kind of predictable lie

And so I pictured us like corpses
Lying side by side in pieces
In some dark and lonely plot under a bough
We looked so silly there all decomposed
Half turned to dust in tattered clothes
Though we probably look just as silly now

Or just stumble around like strangers in the dark
'Cause sometimes you seem so strange to me, I must seem strange to you

Did you memorize your lines? 'cause I did
Here's the part where I get so mad I tell you I can't forget the past
You get so quiet now and you seem somehow like a lost and lonely child
And you just hope that the moment won't last

So there's always a way around
There's something tying our feet to the ground
A moment passed we hear how it sounds
Then it seems a little less profound
Like we're all going the same way down
Yeah we're all going the same way down
I'm just trying to write it all down

'Cause I write songs and you write letters
We are tied like two in tethers
And we talk and read, and laugh and sleep
At night in bed together
And you wake in tears sometimes
I can see your thoughts flash across your eyes
They say darling will you be kind, will you be a good man and stay behind
If I get old?

And then the letters all pass through my head
With the words that I was told
About the fading flesh of life and love
The failures of the bold
I can list each crippling fear like I'm reading from a will

And I'll defy everyone and love you still
I will carry you with me up every hill
And if you die before I die I'll carve your name out of the sky
I'll fall asleep with your memory and dream of where you lie
Maybe better to move on and to let life just carry on and I may be wrong

Still I'll try

Living here in the shadow of this gathering dust,
As the waves build up and drown the light,
While we‚Äôre hanging from buildings on a Saturday night.

And the words she said
I could barely hear over the blare of the speakers and the smell of beer,
As she got up to speak, she lifted her dress.

As we drove through the valley in her daddy‚Äôs Benz.
She said, ‚ÄúThese pills wear off, but the pain don‚Äôt end.
I never thought it would matter so much to pretend.‚Äù

And the thing about her that haunts me still
As her hands fell down to the steering wheel,
And a shock of light fell across her face,
She said there‚Äôs only two ways out of this place.

There‚Äôs no room for us anymore in the atmosphere,
But darling I always liked the desperation in your eyes,
The way you‚Äôd dance in the glow of the Hollywood Freeway lights.

Someday they‚Äôre gonna forget about us
And we‚Äôll wonder if we were ever good enough.
It hit me last night, in this song I heard,
I remember the feeling but forget all the words.

Are we blind to the truth or a sign to believe in?

And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray
Yes those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray

Who can approach Antonio Gaudi
He started a new cathedral, in Barcelona
It is called La Sagrada Familia or the Holy Family
The sad thing is they could try to finish it
But I don't think they will do it

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll meet along the way
Follow the brightest star as far as the brave may dare
What will we find when we get there?

La Sagrada Familia, we pray the storm will soon be over
La Sagrada Familia, for the lion and the lamb

Who knows where the winds may blow us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll ever reach the shore
Follow a rising sun with eyes that may only stare
What kind of fire will burn us there? What kind of fire?
Only a fool would say

La Sagrada Familia, the wind has changed the storm is over
La Sagrada Familia, for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia, we thank the lord the danger's over
La Sagrada Familia, there's peace throughout the land

Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears

Who knows where the world may turn us, only a fool would say
Who knows what the fates may have in store
Follow the light of truth as far as our eyes can see
How should we know where that may be? How should we know?

Then the angry skies, the battle cries, the sounds of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows what's been lost along the way
Look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share
How will we know when we are there? How will we know?
Only a fool would say

La Sagrada Familia, for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia, we thank the lord the danger's over

Have I got enough hope?
Enough strength to face the world each day?

Wwill I say I want you?
Will you say you love me

And will I still love you

And you fire the thoughts that realise all my dreams

You give me something I can't live without

A feeling that I can't suppress

Is this the start of the beginning or the point of no return?

",Knife Edge,1985
The Alarm,"All I want is someone to believe in
But who to believe is hard to define
When some say the future is unwritten
Some say the simple things in life are the best
When all is dark and dusty down the tracks
And all paths from exile have roadblocks on all points
Saying ""No, No way out of here, go back from where you came from""
And some say when you're down you fight the hardest
Some tighten the belt others let go
Someone once said, if you don't ask you don't receive
Someone showed me that written down in the back of a book

And as I reach out and see my life unfold
I tell you this because I truly believe in it
Ask and you'll receive my friend
Seek and you shall find
Oh won't you help me now.

Only the thunder knows
What drives a man in his darkest throes
Fortune and poverty
They're oh so close, oh so close
ONLY THE THUNDER

And some say everything must have a reason
Some say everything will one day soon come to pass
Some say that's life, that's the way the cards fall
Someone once said the answer's blowin' in the wind
And the word I seek to answer all my questions

Is written down on everything I see
It's in the words written on the subway walls
It's filling the concert halls.

Only the thunder knows
What drives a man in his darkest throes
Fortune and poverty
They're oh so close, oh so close

The Alarm,"Do you wake up in the middle of the night
Find your eyes are on full beam
Totally wired
Sweat stains and troubled dreams
Your throat is burnin' dry
Caught in your worst nightmare
You cannot deny

And now you've become
What you said you'd never become
Hate yourself for all the things you've never done
You tell yourself you're too old
I know you're still young
You're wanting to scream
You still hold your tongue

Whoohoo, whoohoo
You're at the breaking point
Whoohoo, whoohoo

Do you remember the night?
Put on dark sunglasses to shut out the light
Shut out the pain
Shut out the red in your eyes you hide
Everytime you look in the mirror
How do you live with your life?

Throw back the covers and make all of your dreams come true
Rebuild your life rebuild your home rethink your values
Rethink yourself right through

I have declared myself unsafe
I have declared myself unsafe
Unsound, unknown, unwanted, unnecessary
I've been condemned
I'm unsafe

And leave behind your bridges burning
Take to hills your time will soon come

Because you're here for a purpose but you'll have to search for it
Whatever it is you have got to decide

'Cause now you're young you've got to run
Don't waste your life don't waste your life.

For better or for worse

Turned you back on the only thing
That could save you from yourself
Where were you hiding

When the rain began to fall

When the thunder and the lightning struck
And the rain and the four winds did howl
After all time building up
Comes inevitable knocking down one by one
Comes receivers liars gamblers
Pick pocket entourage two by two
Selling out is a cardinal sin
Sinning with a safety net
They say all things come in threes three by three
Here comes the third degree

If you can't come down off the fence

Skidding on the tarmac, tripping on the view

Welcome west to the world excess
Bet you halfway through some will settle for less
With a big break sleeping rough at night
On a stone floor like freezed ice

The Alarm,"I was born of nineteen fifty nine
That'll be the day rock'n'roll died
Far away on a dark and stormy night
Brought into the new decade
The sixties and her pearly gates
A hard rain fell and the times forever changed
In the back of a car with the wind in our hair
Speeding down the road going anywhere
Was it true we were really going nowhere?

Sixty eight rang like a ricochet
The world arose to a nightmare day
Some people found their voice and a world to change
One small step for man was one giant leap for mankind
How I wish that we could walk that way tonight
On a Woodstock field in the heat of the night
Rock'n'roll music defined the times
The sound of generations collide

These moments in time
(These moments in time)
Live on forever in my mind
(Live on forever in my mind)
Even though we've said goodbye
(These moments in time)
Live on forever in my mind

And the seventies king of rock'n'roll
In Gracelands lost his throne
There won't be any comebacks tomorrow
No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones
Why they were taken away? God only knows
We formed a band we were haunted by their ghosts
I remember it now like it was yesterday
Playing those guitars at a frantic pace
Somewhere we got lost along the way

These moments in time
(These moments in time)
Live on forever in my mind
(Live on forever in my mind)
Even though we've said goodbye
(These moments in time)
Live on forever in my mind

Through the London streets in a taxi cab
A radio played an epitaph
Imagine, the dream is over
Oh I've been silent way too long
You never thought I knew what was going on
You probably think that you are in this song
The tragedies behind the dreams
Belie the truth and the honesty
I have seen the dirt and the glory

Live on forever in my mind

Even though we've said goodbye

The Alchemist,"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

We're stuck in a place so dark, you could hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
Duck away into the darkness, times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture's there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around
Watchin' the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rocks with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The same lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hopin' to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture's there 
The memory won't escape me 

I'm here at the podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What's happening
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causin' urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls, with dark holds, get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real, this society's deprivation depends not on our differences, but the separation within
No preparation is made, limited aid, minimum wage
Livin' in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspread like permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up",Frgt/10,2002

Yeah! Guess who walk around with diamond chains and rings on 'em
A pair of throwback Jordan's, with the wings on 'em
With all this talking I'm guessin they got them things on 'em
'Cause if not Milli's the Forty Cal's a ring on 'em

I know your kind gettin by leave the city quick
Niggaz bleed just like us I'm on that Biggie shit
First of all I'm sup-posed to ball
I'm sup-posed to have coast to, coast to calls

And your niggaz on your cd's garbage
Yeah they shootin but they missin, sprayin up the wall like graffiti artist
Some niggaz by the bootleg but go and cop the real shit
'Cause the fans love us I'm nicer than grandmothers

I wake up get dressed put on my tan butters
It been this way since Puma's and Super Man cover's
A ice pick could do your liver harm
And have you screamin in the back of the club louder than Lil' Jon

You now lookin at the hood meal ticket seven thou on my wrist
It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this
It keeps the challengers pissed
I vacate to different islands and twist

And back home where the violence exist, now silencers fixed
You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam

With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggaz ramblin on about the paper that they getting stop it

I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah I'm stingy so it's stretch long

This is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits pop

Hey, hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys' pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

5-8 with double-X-L, pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity, the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete

So you can be an architect, design apartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set, I'm never on a chick, I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet, it's just the booze

Check my niggaz, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggaz runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down

Now it's back to the same old shit
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines
I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit

Bloodied up, screamin', I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

It's like this nigga, it's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live

Well, first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
""Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open""
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot

Deuce, deuce, had my pockets full of bullets, I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash, always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queens bridge, always got shot up

No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggaz aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old English Red Bull and Blue Bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit, fuck it, we was broke

Little bad ass, my nigga rap sat me down, like this
He said, ""P, you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind off the street""

And it stuck in the back of my head
Though I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen
Niggaz get cut up, I put it in my rappin'

It's non fiction, it's the real deal fiscal
It couldn't get more graphic, I'm so trail
I said, it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscal
City you havin', let me touch that ass

So tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes

Y'all niggaz is flaggin, yeah we got one too
Infamous, I heard you screamin our name, whatup with you?
Let me explain something, we the world's most
Y'all rap niggaz, we do this shit for real though listen

The Alchemist,"Pain... pain... pain...
Pain... pain... pain...

[Verse 1]
All I know is pain, all I seen is death
Couple homies and brother gone, when I'm gon' step
I ain't suicidal, damn my brain need rest
Think about my childhood, pain in my chest
Past is the past, future ain't great
All right in the hood when any day could be my last
Pop somethin' back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hawk some back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hard bein' a gangsta rapper, you don't know the half
You ain't got to condone it but you was never homeless
And you ain't never fast, so you don't know the wrath
To takin' a long walk, down the wrong path
All I know is pain - everything I did wrong
I did it in vain, that's why I'm tryin' to change
Live for my seeds but the game ain't change
Only the strong survive, I will maintain

[Chorus Styles P (Alchemist)]
All I know is, pain! all I give is, pain!
All I give is, pain! all I live is, pain!
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's no love, ice cold blood runnin' all through my veins)
All I know is, pain! all I give is, pain!
All I give is, pain! all I live is, pain!
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's more than rhymes, more shine than the diamonds on your chain)

[Verse 2]
What you know about pain?
Blood, sweat and tears where I'm standin' in the rain
If I don't blow Mary Jane I'm goin' insane
Before I had a car I was in the fast lane
Drug dealer stick up kids for the neck game, a lot that I regret
But I made it as a rapper, and it's not what I expect
For a fact, this business is more crooked
The boys'll sell they souls to the devil, the Lord lookin'
See in you hell just in case that we all cookin'
I got sins too, lot of foul shit that I been through
The world is God house, I'm just a window, pane
Tryin' to maintain up to the end yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All I know is pain, I feel so drained
Rap niggaz is insane, they on procaine
What they call hot, I would call so lame
They don't care about the art, and they show no shame
If you ain't gettin' spins, then you ain't gon' win
But if you came from the bottom you should stay goin' in
The Ghost don't make it then the phantom gon' win
I'm a make the kids richer, make grandma grin

Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,

Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,

Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster,
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,

Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper,
Shit, Back down,
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum,
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah,
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,

To arm leg-a leg the defenseless
Cause criminals and dons are relentless
Murders are common and senseless
In the ghetto trenches the stench is
Tremendous and poverty, our property is defended by shotguns
Alarm, pit bulls and barbed wire fences
If you're not armed you're in harm's way
You're hunted by wannabe desparados and hombres
I'm sick of all this shit

Speakin about operatin frequently
With keys from Columbians and Dominicans
You silly men, traitors, snakes and reptilians
Niggas act like dumb animals in pit full and cock fights

And escape the bad disaster's path for aftermath

Weak mind created crime-related rahs can't fuck with my blueprints
Stupid, the end is near while fools give up the youth
Yappin force action they gat clappin guns and beer
Beer is done skunks and fear the other knotty set up
To killers, you faked up niggas shut the hell up
I'm fed up so I develop the ill scheme to envelop
These bitch teen sweated up black devil vessiles
I'll dead you with lethal style evil ogre
Slash demon cobra in these last days a scientist take over

The Alex Levin Trio,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,

Shake their shoulders bold.

Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

The Alex Welsh Band,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide

An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me.

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2015

With a man who's half my age
A halfwit in a leoatard stands on my stage

My value has dropped

Whilst others creep in fear
Try if you can to walk like a man

Prowl like a lion in Africa
Leap like a salmon home form the sea
To keep up with me
You've got to walk like a panther tonight

Like a derilict man who had died out of shame
Like a jumble sale left out in the rain

My regards to your mother.
Happy birthday Nicola,
May you have many others.
You don't know me,
But I've watched you grow breasts from afar,
For so long.

Listen to the old generation,
We are here to help you through.
If you need some information,
I can help you.
Listen to the old generation,
We are here to help you through.
If we'd used some contraception
I wouldn't be here, and you wouldn't be you.

There was a club in the city centre.
Long ago,
In the bar that's where I met her.
But I never thought I'd see,
What I have in front of me....today.

Here's to the children,
of fumbling in the dark.
Underneath the piles of coats,
behind the railings in the park.

you'd be asking me one day for a lifetime of love
and 16 years of pocket money.

The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

Awake awake

Stretch this song to a fever cadence
Up 3 days

Never change these distances

Just be brave
Just listen to me
Your heart gives mine reason to beat

Could be a night when your life ends

The All-American Rejects,"There are few who deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have see grown men give out a shriek
With a wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears",Jack's Lament,2008

In a whisper say goodbye

You can't take that from me
Cause it's all that you left that's mine
You had to leave
And that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind

There are times
You're so impossible that I should sign a waiver
And you will find
Someone worth walking on when you ask me to go

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and there it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows

There was a day
You threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay
But since you wanna play
We can finally say we're through

Pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave but just know

As I lay in solitude
Oh what's a boy supposed to do
I shake the very thought of you
Me together, I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late
All I do is wait and wait
Your never coming home to me
That's the hardest thing to see

I got to breathe

And the truth that makes us laugh will make you cry

She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow

I tried to get her talkin'
She didn't have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way

She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window
At the pine trees and the rain
It wasn't her day

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain
The hours that we talked
Seemed like minutes all in vane

I watched
As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin'

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known
Multicolored lady
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home

Oh, by the way, I'm bound for Rome

Satan came with fire to burn me,
Wouldn't listen when they warned me.
A dagger in my back while she's calling me honey,
Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money.

She put up a sign and my house began to wail.
But, why, why, why I couldn't see it in my little girl's eyes?
She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me.
And I would ask the woman, ""Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?
You ain't gonna rule me.""

I reached out, threw the Ace of Spades.
I put her on a train to the Everglades.

now all the things that use to mean so much to me
Has made me old before my time

Would it ever be much different now
Remind me of the past, I slip into a dream
Funny things ain't never what they seem

Living like children, never doing what we are told
Would not hesitate to take to take a chance
That road behind me now was paved with fool‚Äôs gold

You were really goin' to town

You say they're just jealous
That you'll always be mine
Nighttime has a thousand eyes
Could they all be blind?

Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?
'Cause this confusion, oh, it's killing me
They all say that you're doing me wrong
But our love is much too strong
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Who to believe

Baby, I really need you
Though I love you like a child
But I won't have no cheatin' woman
Tellin' lies and runnin' wild

I really want to believe you
When you say that you're bein' true
But everywhere I look
Like the finger points to you

Or am I a fool? Am I a fool?
'Cause this confusion always killing me
They all say that you're doing me bad
You're the best thing I've ever had

All because a foolish man lied
She gave up everything
Everything that money could buy

But the man told so many lies
There's another man over there
That woman across the river
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine

Word got around that he had jilted her
Men came running from near and far
Should've never been so foolish
Guess I'll never

But the man that's got her now
He's a lucky so and so
That woman across the river
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine

I remember the other day, about a week ago
She said, ""I don't even want to talk to you
'Cause I don't love you anymore""

Oh my friends keep on askin'
Boy what's wrong with you?
I say I'm worried
Worried down with the blues

Try to be a good man
Work my fingers to the bone
And you return the favor
By messing up my happy home

You played so many dirty tricks
Till I lost my faith in you
Now you want me to take you back
What's a poor man supposed to do?

Now I'm starin' down at my shoes

On my very best friend
And when my back was turned
You were messin' around with him

I'd give up everything
To have you by my side

I'm holdin' to my foolish pride

The Allman Brothers Band,"Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
Oh, sit beneath the trees, linger in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh my, but that country boy can play!""

Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go!
Now, Johnny B. Goode

Oh, come on Johnny, do it!

Oh, look out!

His mother told him someday he would be a man
And he would be the leader of a rock'n'roll band
Oh, many people coming from miles around
Hear him play his guitar when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name would be in lights
Saying ""Johnny B. Goode tonight!""

I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself

Be without your love

Sitting here beside myself

Cause I didn't know me

To have you lying by my side

16 days and I wake up and I'm outta here
It's been hell since I got in here
Now I'm back on the streets where the problems that I left still remain
Nothing seemed to change
So I'm right back where I started
No j-o-be	 to make ends meet
I'm gettin change on the streets
But this ain't how I planned it, I'm trippin
I can feel myself slippin
From the beginnin I been tryin to get a grip, but I can't grab hold
24 years old and I'm out here on my own
Yo, I'm slowly losin my mind
Nobody knows the pain I been holdin up inside
Buildin up insid is enough shit to hurt ya, it's torture
When your mind tries to desert ya, no one to support ya
For some of y'all life has been a fantasy
And I been livin up in hell, nigga, lookin for my sanity

But this time I grab my nine just in case I gotta tear up
Hard times all around

Make no mistake, I'll be a dog till I die
I'm always livin on the edge and I wonder why
See, motherfuckers want to kill me, but that's aight
Cause when I go in, niggaz still screamin ""RSO""
Until that time I lived my life day for day
Never knowin when another nigga gonna try to (kill Ray)
So now I'm thinkin to myself is it really all worth it
No, better yet, do I deserve this

I feel like that dude when Jaws was in a water
I can't seem to redeem all my traction
Too many trife niggaz around me to be relaxin
Gotta watch those who I'm 'posed to trust
Don't want to but I'll haunt you if I have to bust
To protect my welfare
You clowns tryin to bring me down'll catch hell here
I won't falter, you can't halt a
Devilish mind when I climb behind the altar
People, stay calm, I'll be real brief
I puff weed from the Philly blunt leaf
And if they torment the E any further
Insanity'll be my plea bargain for murder
Born in hell under a spell called calamity

One two a river unseen by the waste in your life

Another break in your way is a sign, she says
I look forward, watch you eat your words today
Run to the look in your darkened eyes
Still they're alive

Another day is a step towards grey, she says
I just wonder if she'll ever be today
Run to the winter cold embrace
Stealing my life

Another running away is your sign, she says
I look forward, watch the sky recede today
One two a fateful turn away
Sealing our lives

I'm lost in your eyes again 
Once I met your gaze 
And find the way 
The way to be cold again ",Winter,2001
The Alphabet Girls,"Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel

So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

Because the night
Belongs to lovers
Because the night
Belongs to us",Because the Night,2006
