Joe Turner,"My mama done tol' me,
When I was in knee pants,
My mama done tol' me, Son!
A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye;
But when the sweet talkin's done,
A woman's a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing
The blues in the night

Now the rain's a-fallin',
Hear the train a-callin'
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' `cross the trestle,
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
A whoo-ee-duh-whoo-ee, ol' clickety clack's
A-echoin' back the blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

Take my word, the mockin' bird'll
Sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong and he's right

From Natchez to Mobile,
From Memphis to St. Jo,
Wherever the four winds blow,
I been in some big towns,
An' heard me some big talk,
But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two face,
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing the blues in the night.

My mama was right,
There's blues in the night.",Blues in the Night,2000
Joe Turner,"When I first met you baby, baby
You were just sweet sixteen
You just led me on, baby, sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you would not do nothing for me baby, you would not do
Anything I asked you to
Now, you ran away from your home baby, now you want to run away from me too

Well, my brother, he's in Korea, and my sister, down in New Orleans
Well my mother's up in heaven, lord, what's gonna happen to me?

Yes I love you, I've always loved you
Ever since I called your name
But seems like everything I do, oh, has been in vain

Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen
Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen
Well, the sweetest thing that I ever seen, sweet sixteen",Sweet Sixteen,2000
Joe Turner,"Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

Now all you men's the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name
Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday

I'm gonna lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always
Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues away",Trouble in Mind,2000
Joe Turner,"I was in my bed a-sleepin', oh-boy, what a dream
I was in my bed sleepin', oh-boy, what a dream
I was dreamin' 'bout my TV Mama, the one with the big, wide screen

She got great big eyes
And little bitty feet
And in the waist, she's so nice and neat
She's my TV Mama, one with the big, wide screen
Every time she loves me, man, she makes me scream

Oh, she's mighty fine, lovely picture

Got a taste like candy, boys, I really go for sweets
I love her from her head down to her little bitty feet

Yeah, she's my TV Mama, one with the big, wide screen
Every time she loves me, oh yes, I'm bound to scream

I'm just kind-a rollin', tumblin'
Talkin' all out of my head
Well just, I'm rollin' and tumblin'
Man, I'm talkin' all out of my head
And when my baby shook me
Man, I fell right out of bed",TV Mama,2000
Joe Turner,"Have no fear, Big Joe is here
Oh you're real crazy baby, love you madly

Well all right, well all right, you got yourself a Cadillac car
Well all right, well all right, you hangin' out in the finest bars
Well all right, well all right, you've gone just a little too far

Well all right, well all right, the bebop's gone to your head
You used to love me baby, now your love is dead
We used to scuffle for hot dogs, tell me where you got that bread

Well, you ride around with all the finest cats in town
You in your black dress and your sequin gown
Ah, you'll be coming back when the deal goes down

Oh, boy

Down girl down
Down girl down
Down girl down
Down girl down
Down girl down
You been running all over town

I said yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)

Joe Turner,"I've flown around the world in a plane 
I've settled revolutions in Spain 
And the North Pole I have charted 
Still I can't get started with you 
On the golf course, I'm under par 
Metro Goldwyn have asked me to star 
I've got a house, a showplace 
Still I can't get no place with you 
Cause you're so supreme 
Lyrics I write of you, I dream 
Dream day and night of you 
And I scheme just for the sight of you 
Baby, what good does it do? 
I've been consulted by Franklin D 
Greta Garbo has had me to tea 
Still I'm broken-hearted 
Cause I can't get started with you",I Can't Get Started,2001
Joe Turner,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me! 
 
I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,",I Left My Heart in San Francisco,2001
Joe Turner,"Why do you go on pretending
You know you want to be free
Darling, you know I'll let you go
You'd do the same for me
 
I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
And I'll understand
 
I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand.
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind

Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
",I Understand,2001
Joe Turner,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",2001
Joe Turner,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2001
Joe Turner,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2001
Joe Turner,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2001
Joe Turner,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose",Honeysuckle Rose,2003
Joe Turner,"The night is getting on
The band is getting slow
The crowd is almost gone
But here we are still dancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

Our feet can barely move
My legs are yelling ""Whoa""
But we're in such a groove
And love is still advancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

You can't suggest that we could go on jitterbugging
No bugging

We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than hugging
Just hugging

But we don't need much room to gently cut-a-rug in, we two

We're dead on our feet
And the sauce is repeatin'
But what can you do?

I tried another juice
And get from head to toe
My body's feeling loose
And warm and kind of supple

Nothing to do, but waltz

My man would slip away
My arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay,
Till we're the only couple

Nothing to do, but waltz

You never know how far this sort of thing can get you
One never knows, one never, never knows

We're not as tired as we would like to think, I bet you
You stay up half the night with me, if I would let you
Yes

So come, let the waltz play again",Jitterbug Waltz,2003
Joe Turner,"Now when I get the blues, I get me a rockin' chair
When I get the blues, I get me a rockin' chair
Well, if the blues overtake me gonna rock right away from here

Now when I get lonesome, I jump on the telephone
When I get lonesome, I jump on the telephone
I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

Give me one more kiss, hold it a long long time
Give me one more kiss, hold it a long long time
Now love me baby, till the feelin' hits my head like wine

Here comes my baby, flashin' her new gold tooth
Here comes my baby, flashin' her new gold tooth
Well she's so small, she can mambo in a pay phone booth

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

I'm like a mississippi bullfrog, sittin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a mississippi bullfrog, sittin' on a hollow stump
I got so many women, I don't know which way to jump

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye","Flip, Flop and Fly",2006

Joe Val,"A house not a home was the picture Satan painted 
For sweet little sister and me 
Our daddy would frown while mother was prayin' 
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe. 

In anger he'd swear his voice low and loud 
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd 
I've never seen my daddy inside the house of God 
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod. 

Not long ago our circle was broken 
When God called on Mother one night 
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken 
Asking our daddy to raise her children right. 

The angels rejoiced in Heaven last night 
I heard my daddy pray ""Dear God, make it right."" 
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes 
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night 
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night.

Joe Val,"No not a word no not a word
No not a word from home anyhome

If only I could hear just one little word 
From Mother and Daddy my heart would fill with cheer
Each day I take a walk I travel down the trail
Each day the postman tells me no letter in the mail

If only I could hear one little word from home
My heart would be so flattered I never more would roam
The days have turned to weeks the weeks have turned to years
Without one little word from ones I love so dear

The last time Mother wrote they were all okay
But I'm getting worried they're getting old and gray
Each night I say a player and I always say
I'll start home tomorrow I can't live on this way",Not a Word from Home,1995
Joe Val,"Sitting alone in an old rocking chair,
I saw an old mother with silvery hair,
She looked so neglected by those who should care,
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair.

Her hands were all callused and wrinkled and old,
A life of hard work was the story they told,
And I thought of angles when I saw her there,
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair.

Bless her old heart do you think she complained,
Though life had been bitter she'd live it again,
And carry the cross that was more than her share,
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair.

It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart,
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part,
A letter would brighten her empty life there,
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

I know some children in an orphan home,
Who'd think they owned heaven if she were there own,
They'd never be willing to let her sit there,
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair.

I look at her and I think what a shame,
The ones that forgot her she still loves the same,
And I think of angels when I see her there,
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair.

And where are you going, my pretty lady
I'm goin out a-walkin, on the banks of the sea
Just to see the waters glide, and hear the nightingale sing

Now they had not been standing, but a minute or two
When out of his knapsack, a fiddle he drew
And the tune that he played, made the valleys all ring
Oh hark, cried the maiden, hear the nightingale sing

Oh maiden, fair maiden, tis` time to give o`er
Oh no, kind soldier please play one tune more
For I'd rather hear your fiddle, at the touch of one string
Than to see the waters glide, and hear the nightingale sing

Oh soldier, kind soldier, will you marry me
Oh no, pretty maiden, that never shall be
I've a wife in olde London, and children, twice three
Two wives and the army's too many for me

Well I'll go back to London, and I'll stay there for a year
It's often that I'll think of you, my little dear
And if ever I return, it will be in the spring

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

End it all and let her go to some better man;

Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

I would die

It's a brand new blues,

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Just so with you and with me

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

I like tits for lunch;

I like tits for breakfast

If I were you, I'd worry about that tooth

Well, I worry about big business and if they tell the truth
I worry about the Commies undermining all our youth
I worry about Afghanistan, I worry about the Poles

Well, you thought they'd take it lightly 

They're actin' kinda rash 
Caught you in a loadin' zone 
So they smile very politely 
Relieved you of your cash

You play the double agent 
You bug each other's phone 
You got the place surrounded

To play another game

Fifteen years on the road.

Played every song we know.

I was a young man I used to be but I still can rock and roll.

Fifteen years been good to me,
Fifteen in a row.

Look through the crowd for the folks I know,
Fifteen years on the road.
Fifteen years they have stood by me,
Fifteen in a row.
If it’s a show they want, it’s a show they’ll see here we go.

Joe Walsh,"Floating on a bubble while the world goes down the drain.
Somebody pulled the plug, the dirty dishes still remain.
And when the bubble bursts that’s the worst for those who play dirty games.
While the world goes down the drain, down the drain.

Floating on a bubble, slipping on the soap,
Standing in the tub insane.
While the world goes down the drain.
And that’s the rub, reality is so hard to explain.
Meanwhile the world goes down the drain, down the drain.

So I’m floating on a bubble while the world goes down the drain.
Slipping on the soap, running out of rope,
But all and all I can’t complain,
And that’s the rub according to the rules of the game.

Joe Walsh,"If you look at your reflection at the bottom of the well 
What you see is only on the surface 
When you try to see the meaning, hidden underneath
The measure of the depth can be deceiving 
The bottom has a rocky reputation 

You can feel it in the distance the deeper down
You stare
From up above it's hard to see 
But you know when you're there
On the bottom words are shallow
The surface talk is cheap
You can only judge the distance by the company you keep 
In the eyes of the confessor

In the eyes of the confessor
There's no place you can hide
You can't hide from the eyes (of the confessor) 
Don't you even try 
In the eyes of the confessor 
You can't tell a lie
You cannot tell a lie (to the confessor) 
Strip you down to size
Naked as the day that you were born
Naked as the day that you were born

Take all the trauma, drama, comments
The guilt and doubt and shame

The jealousy and hatred
The tempest and discord

But it ended up another song.
I am sorry that the news can’t be better, dear John.
When we started out I thought we were different,
We ended up exactly the same.
So in order to protect the innocent,
The names have been changed.
I just got to get back to my music, to my music.
And I know that we both promised forever,
Forever didn’t last that long.
Maybe someday I will write you a letter,
Until then at least I wrote you this song, dear John.
I just got to get back my music, and all the things that go along with the job.

Joe Walsh,"Well a good man’s getting hard to find these days but there still a few around.
A whole world looks up to a good man, It’s hard to keep him down.
So if you’re going out looking for a good, good time,
But the boys all turn into clowns,
Focus your attention, don’t forget to mention,
No don’t forget to mention that the boys just love it when you dish it out.
Easy with the ones you’ve found.
And your wind up toys keep you busy for awhile until a good man comes around.

Well you can yell and scream, treat them mean, beat them up with words,
Throw them in the face you say.
Do this, do that what it is, where it’s at, anything to get you your way.
And you change your mood, cop an attitude, take them to the cleaners.
Just because you’re steaming, just because you’re hot,
Just because all the boys stop talking when you raise your voice.
Your temper ends up on the ground, you don’t mean nothing to a good man.
It’s hard to keep a good man down, down, down, down.
Well it’s hard to keep a good man down.

Go to war, slam doors, have a fit, throw shit, use every little trick you’ve found.
It don’t mean nothing to a good man,
Just because all the boys start shaking when the dishes fly,
Tremble as they crawl on the ground.
Well it’s hard to keep a good,
Hard to keep a good man down.
Yes it’s hard to keep a good man down.",Good Man Down,1985

In a shopping mall.
I asked my baby for her number,
In case I called her up, in case I called her up.
I called my baby on the telephone,
I said, “Hello” on the telephone.
I took my baby to the movies,
Sat in the front row.
Got her some popcorn, bought her some bon bons.
We sat in the front row.
I took my baby out to dinner,
A table just for two, a table just for two.
I took my baby to Las Vegas,
Chartered a private plane.
We took some naps, we shot some crap,
Chartered a private plane.
I took her shopping, next thing I know,
I took my baby to Aspen,
I broke my leg, she fell in love.
I broke my leg,
I got a letter from my ex-baby today, nice.",I Broke My Leg,1985
Joe Walsh,"Hey now, did you make a problem?
Didn't want to solve.
Until you do you do, that's the thing about them, 
Still got them, problems. 

Seems so small, they can tower over you.
Pile up, build a wall, 
Around you, surround you, oh and how. 
When you finally think they're through,
So they follow, follow?
I wonder who can solve my problem.
Oh how about them?

Problems can wait,
Problems get solved
Problems relate,
Problems revolve around tense situations, 
Tense situations left unresolved.
Something comes up, you get involved.
In justifications of foreign relations that have nothing to do,
No nothing at all with the problem.

Hey now did you ever have one,
Have a problem?
That you could not solve.
What did you do about them?
What did you do? 
Did you try and close your eyes?
Put the blame on someone else?
But the problem follows you around and round,
Up and down until it takes up all your time.
Til it starts to bother you, til you start to lose your mind.
Your problems, they love it when you do they do too.

Problems that wait, never get solved.
Problems relate to and problems revolve around tense situations,
Tense situations, left unresolved. 
When something comes up and got you involved with contradiction, 
Fictional frictions that have nothing to do, no nothing at all with the problem.

Hey now, did you ever have one? Have a problem that you could not solve?
That's the thing about them, problems.",Problems,1985
Joe Walsh,"Too long on the road, my friend 
Too long between rides 
Too long between homes again 
Too long without someone by my side 

And Lord, there's something 'bout a sad song 
That helps to ease the pain
Here I am, Lord, just singing up a storm 
And I'm all alone again

Too much going down today 
Just can't take it in 
Too much running 'round today 
Can't tell you where I've been 

Seems that just like singing in the only thing to do 
Only thing to help me pass the time 
Songs are just like ladies--can't forget them when you're through 
And they're always on your mind

And the rosewood bitters 
Help me meet the sunshine in the morning 
And the rosewood bitters 
Help me through the night 
When I feel blue 

Too few stop to pass the time 
Guess that's how it goes 
So sure that there's much more than this 
When really no one knows 

And easing into midnight 
As the bitters pass around 
Crying in my beer 
Singing someone else's troubles 
Help to ease your own

Help me meet the sunshine in the morning

Help me through the night 
When I feel blue",Rosewood Bitters,1985
Joe Walsh,"I catch your reflection though smoke-filled eyes. 
Begin my inspection I watch you.
Your smooth syncopation, 
You synthesize the beat and the vibration.
There's something about you, your sultry ways
That gives me a shiver.
Your style's so enticing, you wear it well
Completely inviting I watch you.

[Chorus]
If I smiled at you would you walk my way?
Would you have this dance with me?

Wouldn't that be fun? 

Fun 
And if anyone asks you I like having fun 
Fun 
I like having fun 
Here we go now 

Well if I was king I'd sign a proclamation 
And if I was president I'd pass a law

Makes it so hard to define 
Where do you draw the line? 

Seems like fifty percent's about the best you can do 
Based on latest projections

rules 
But then again there's always exceptions 
To the rules 

Amidst all this confusion

And sometimes I travel down Memory
Lane
With the Yesterday Daily Review

Memories carefully kept in a pile
Like newspapers stacked in a corner
To relive my yesterdays once in a while
Although they are faded and worn
They remind me
Once in a while
Of far away places and long ago names
Yesterdays back down the road that
You came
Somewhere behind you down Memory
Lane
Memory Lane, down Memory Lane

And when my luck comes to the end
Of the line
Like old men you see in the subway
I'll thumb through the pages and take
My last ride
With the Yesterday Daily Review
Right there beside me
To remind me
Once in a while

Of far away places and long ago names
Yesterdays back down the road that
You came
Somewhere behind you down Memory

I can't get no sleep like I used to do
All night long, the wild boys run through the streets

There's no peace in the jungle when the moon is high
Watch the war babies go hungry and cry
There's no peace in the jungle when the moon is high
Everybody's fightin', nobody knows why
Why, why, why?

At dawn the refugees are seekin' shelter
And from the violence of the night they run in fright helter skelter
From the volatile eruption and the wolves of war
Nurse their young famine and destruction

I like the way that it sounds 
On the radio 

I like to sit in a silent place 
When no one's around 
And listen inside it 

Inside the silence is a melody 
Voices singing harmony 
I close my eyes and listen carefully 
The silence starts to get loud 

It's like your favorite station 
Playing your favorite song 
Just like they do on the radio 
Like they do on the radio 

Inside the silence is a symphony 
Every note there is in every key 
The music tells me how it wants to be 
I help it write itself down 
I hear the way that would sound

All of a sudden something's wrong

You take it for granted

All of a sudden time is gone



You put a little distance in between it

Hope it makes sense later on



You don't know what happened

Dreams never turn out like you planned

The next moment you wake up

Stranded in a one night stand



You put a little distance in between it

Until you seen it hope that later on



I know it's hard to wait that long

But right now baby

We both agree, something's wrong

Something's wrong



All of a sudden

May be weak and try again

But baby, baby, baby I don't know when

Until then



You put a little distance in between it

Until we seen it

Maybe later on



I know it's hard it seems so long

We both agree, oh baby

I know, I know.

And so am I

With average kids

And average wives

We all go bowling at the bowling lanes

Drink a few beers

Bowl a few frames

We're just ordinary average guys

And every Saturday we work in the yard

Pick up the dog do

Hope that it's hard (whaf whaf)

Take out the garbage and clean out the garage

My friend's got a Chrysler

I've got a Dodge

One is right and the other is wrong

One man's pleasure is another man's pain

Good guys win bad guys get blamed

Another day tomorrow, tomorrow's just another day. 
Days turn into years, and time goes by, over and over, 
Again and again, and then, years turn into decades. 
Decades. Start another decade, times ten. 
Ten decades, one hundred years. 
Ten decades. And the first ten started going so much faster, 
Than the whole one hundred years before. 

And the second ten we started fighting. 
We fought the war to end all wars. 
So somebody named the twenties roaring, 
And in the thirties we fought some more. 
And the fighting went on and on (and on); 
Nobody could stop it (stop it, stop it) 
So somebody built a bomb (bomb); 
All you had to do was drop it (drop it), right or wrong. 
They dropped it; they dropped it. 
And toward the end of the forties, after the storm, I was born. 

I am calling, across a field, from far away, far away. 
This is my calling song; I am worried, I am concerned. 
There are reasons, can't be explained. 
And there are questions, that have no answers. 
That's the reason I want to know: how long, how long, can this go on? 
I want to know how long, how long, 
When so many things happen, nothing gets done. 
So many wars, no one ever won one, and no one
Ever will, 
No one ever will. 
I am calling, this is my calling song. 

And the fifties were the best I guess, except for the fighting 
And the sixties were unrest, oh yes, we went to the moon. 
We had hopes, we had dreams, 
And sometimes late at night it still seems like,
Camelot. 
And the seventies lasted 'til May. 
And on the hill, that day, I gave up and started writing Decades. 
And the eighties were a waste of time, and here we are, in the nineties! 
Nine in a row, one more to go, oh! Over and over, again and again.

Joe Walsh,"On a rainy Wednesday morning, on the day that I was born
In my old sharecropper's one room country shack
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just like to mention that my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning and a milking and a churning
Picking cotton raisin' hell and baling hay

I been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Carolina, I don't guess
I'll ever find another woman put together like you are
With your wiggle and you're walking and your big city talking
And your brand new shiny Plymouth rag top car

Hey, let's hurry up and wait in this world of give and take
It seems like haste it makes me waste every time
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll
You better know I get my share of mine

I been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

He whistles but he cannot sing

I find that i am whistling, too

That I sit beneath like a vagabond
Who wears his fear

Like a parade, it cuts a path
Light shows on our foolish way
And darkness on

Focus on health so that I'm not ruled out
Exercise my knowledge and abolish all stress
Get a good sleep and tomorrow I press

Today I'm...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Bicasso]
Now let's pretend that I was just born
A niggas first breath, heartbeat, a life with no scorn
It wasn't me, it was the egos of MCs they say
The mic tempt me too

But like the dollars makes 'em fishy dude ok
The average day I got the duties of a lifeguard for myself
When I'm swimmin' in a system makes it so hard
But at the rest I just post up fine,

Patrol my coastline and make the most of my mind
Create the envelope and push it to the people on the avenue
The ones stuck in they offices, this world is a vacuum
But my sauce it got some smack too

Like on a Sunday afternoon I got you tuned into the spiciness
Blended just right with this in the pocket like some jeans
Or the rhythm of these funk strings and I might just get
Another dosage of this slow shit

It's bumpin in my system and my soul too,
It's what I do when I'm alone, it's like some soul food
I wouldn't just get up from the table man, it's too smooth
This groove is better than any wrong thing

And if the phone rings I'm'a hit 'em back now
Let the song sing...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Pep Love]
I'm unavailable for comment
I'd rather go sail my boat and ride the tail of a
Comet, inhale of the chronic, a glass of orange juice,
Read a book, write a poem,

Hike a trail in the forest dude!
Breathe in fresh air
Release pressure
Extend and bend and strength yeah!

Burn a incense, silence my mind in a instant
Because now is the time and I'm in this
It gets me open like Halls Mentholyptus
Pine cones and eucalyptus leaves

Mushrooms and wild flowers bloom
And cool Cali breeze
Make me feel superhuman
I might fly a kite, go home rock the mic

Throw on a song I like, call up my girl to bone
I'm in my own world, a zone
And it be them days like this when I don't answer the phone
I'm clearing my space

Excuse me while I take this brief intermission
From out the rat race
No hustle and bustle though my muscles are strong
I just don't want to do nothing

But sing my song...

And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight, still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me

Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

From that day, we'd never ever part

If I should leave you, girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now",I'd Be a Fool Right Now,1970
Joe Williams,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

Ah yes, I was wrong
Again
I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough-ful of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1970

I fell in love with your heart and soul
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul
I begged to be adored
I lost control and tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing
But now I see what one embrace can do

Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Was my heart's domain

That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That un-felt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew

The shadows around me
Just disappeared from view
The world became rosy
Each corner so cozy

That love can be a paradise

You showed me the way",You Showed Me the Way,1992

Not a sign of people who wants people?

Then at least a million before
Was there any rare expectation
Like there was some kind of somethin' in store

Did the sky have to hold back the thunder?
Did the moon find new reasons to glow?
Could the children somehow sense the wonder
2000 Decembers ago?

Were the sheep as amazed as the shepherds
At the new star that lit up the sky?
Did the willow trees whisper excitement
To the rivers and streams passing by?

Did the joy ricochet off the mountains
'Til it filled up the valleys below?
Did all the world sense love abounding
2000 Decembers ago?

Was anyone able to look at the stable
And not see a child but a King
I wish, I could hear back over the years
As heaven and nature sing, heaven and nature sing

Did the walls of the barn start to tremble
With a glory they could not contain?
Did anyone wake with the feeling
Of peace that they could not explain?

Oh, the love must have been overwhelming
As it warmed everyone in its flow
For all of the earth is still telling

That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel
Little me with my quiet upbringing
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch
I'd start popping my springs
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding

Yes, I knew my morale would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Well, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a gate, I would swing
Have a fling almost any old thing
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong

Joe Williams,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you

An optical illusion too?

'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Joe Zawinul,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1963
Joe Zawinul,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1966

In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.

Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Takin' a Chance on Love,1992

That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1992

I won't waste any time
I'll strike while the iron is hot

If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk, and whisper, and look
I could write a preface
On how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
And the world discovers
As my book ends

You met this heart of mine
Would you unwind it?
Now you would shun it over a glass of wine

Friends knew it all the time
That no wedding bells would chime
I was just a young dreamer, no match for a schemer
Yours was a lover's crime

Folks gossiped--they said it was too good to be true
They even bet you'd search for someone new
This pendent world of ours was paradise
And I was blind by the star dust in my eyes

I know you will try it one more time
But I prayed like Napoleon Bonaparte

[ VERSE 1: Ice-T ]
Ice-T, let me kick my credentials
A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat""
The Dude is def no doubt, what can I say?
The man can roll with Ice-T or Michael J

I'm on the case, just like an attorney
The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Back up and give the brother room 
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction
I was once told by the Dude that knowledge is a food
To nourish, so to conclude
This from an Asiatic descendant, Big Daddy is shocked

[ VERSE 4: cool Moe Dee ]
An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

And planted some pines in the sand 
Every day I looked their way 
But just couldn't understand 

Why they never grew like I thought they should do 
I just couldn't understand why 
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through 
And today I just happened by 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I bet you wouldn't know me now

I'll never forget the morning I left 
The hum of the bees in the hay 
The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today 

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch 
Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone 
There waiting to join me in the shade

Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs",Tall Pines,1991

Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold
Her eyes were as blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose
And she promised she would always love me

Body and soul, body and soul
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
Her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are fallin' like rain

That's how she loved me, with body and soul
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

And I'm sinking in my thoughts again
And my life is pulled over a shoulder.

And I feel like I'm losing all my power.

When I'm down so low
It's so hard to find the top,
Hard to see the top.

I can finally breathe.
Because I feel like I've been under the water.

And you take my hand,
And you lead the way.
Help me up to the top of the water.

And I'm frightened by the present tense
In a world without pretense
And no longer a burden to shoulder.

What I fear the most is freedom;
All the glory and the kingdom come,
Because before all my dreams had been shattered.

When I'm down so low
It's so hard to find the top,
Hard to see the top.

Then you come to me.
I can finally breathe
Because I feel like I've been under the water.

And you take my hand,
And you lead the way.

You are never alone.
