Lonnie Donegan,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.",Nobody's Child,1977
Lonnie Donegan,"Sweet sixteen goes to church 
Just to see the boys 
Laughs and screams and giggles 
At every little noise 
Turns her face a little 
And turns her head awhile 
But everybody knows she's 
Only putting on the style 

She's putting on the agony 
Putting on the style 
That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while 
And as I look around me 
I sometimes have to smile 
Seeing all the young folks 
Putting on the style 

Well the young man in the hot rod car 
Driving like he's mad 
With a pair of yellow gloves 
He's borrowed from his dad 
He makes it roar so lively 
Just to make his girlfriend smile 
But she knows he's only 
Putting on the style 

He's putting on the agony

That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while

Preacher in the pulpit 
Roars with all his might 
Sing Glory Halleluja 
Puts the folks all in a fright 
Now you might think it's satan 
That's a-coming down the aisle 
But it's only our poor preacher boys 
That's putting on his style 

Putting on the agony

That's what all the young folks 
Are doing all the while

MY OLD MAN'S A DUSTMAN - 31/03/1960  
4 weeks at #1 - 13 weeks on chart 

Now here's a little story 
To tell it is a must 
About an unsung hero 
That moves away the dust 

Some people make a fortune 
Others earn a mint 
My old man don't earn much 
In fact he's bloomin' skint 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 
He looks a proper 'nana 
In his great big hob nailed boots 
He's got such a job to pull 'em up 
That he calls 'em daisy roots 

Some folks give tips at christmas 
And some of them forget 
So when he picks their bins up 
He spills some on the step 
Now one old man got nasty 
And to the council wrote 
Next time my old man went round there 
He punched him up the throat 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

I say I say Les 
(Yeah) 
I found a police dog in my dustbin 
(How do you know it was a police dog) 
He had a policeman with him 

Though my old mans a dustman 
He's got an 'art of gold 
He got married recently 
Though he's 86 years old 
We said 'ere hang on dad 
You're getting past your prime 
He said well when you get my age 
It 'elps to pass the time 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

I say I say I say 
My dustbin's full of lilies 
(Well throw'em away then) 
I can't lily's wearing 'em 

Now one day whilst in a hurry 
He missed a ladies bin 
He hadn't gone but a few yards 
When she chased after him 
What game d'you think you're playing 
She cried right from the 'art 
You've missed me am I too late 
Nah jump up on the cart 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

I say I say I say 
(Not you again) 
My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools 
(How d'you know it's full) 
Cuz there's not mushroom inside 

He found a tiger's head one day 
Nailed to a piece of wood 
The tiger looked quite miserable 
But I suppose he should 
Just then from out the window 
A voice began to wail 
He said Oy where's me tigers head 
Four feet from his tail 

Oh my old man's a dustman 
He wears a dustman's hat 
He wears cor blimey trousers 
And he lives in a council flat 

Next time you see a dustman 
Looking all pale and sad 
Don't kick him in the dustbin

Lonnie Donegan,"Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more
",Beyond the Sunset,1985

I'm gonna do some work on you

Whatever shall I do?
Hallelujah,
The question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
The bonny burning question,
What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?

On the bedpost overnight

I love you and
The one who holds you tight!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Sat'day night
On the bedpost overnight

Lonnie Donegan,"Tear drops fell on mama's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said, we miss you girl
We love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Lonnie Donegan,"This town is full of guys
Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,
If they lost that old ace down in the hole!",Ace in the Hole,1993

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Lonnie Donegan,"If you wanna get in trouble let me tell you how to do it
Get yourself a guitar and then you're right into it
You play all day and you play all night
People say you'll never learn to play the thing right
Always messing about, groaning at you
Moaning, won't let you practice

So I bought myself a guitar about a year ago
The man said I could learn it in a week or so
Gave me a little book, pick or two
Said, ""Here why'are mate, it's up to you""
Dirty rotter, cost me ten nicker, all the loot I had
Good guitar, though, called it a pluck it

Anyway, spent me dough
And I couldn't let it all go to waste, you know
So I took the book, guitar and all
And I went back home where the trees are tall
Down in Woodford, good place to be if you've got a guitar
Pretty rotten if you ain't

Well, for weeks and weeks I worked hard
And I tried to learn a few main chords
The book says they're easy as ABC
Cor, my fingers is killing me, got sore on the ends
Couldn't hold the strings down
Wanted to pack up, cor, I felt rough

Anyway, kept on playing with all me might
I could see Mum's hair was turning white
And her face was lined with discontent
She said her patience was pretty near spent
She was nervous, ears ringing, wanted to scream
You know, couldn't get no relief

So sister, anyway, she took it worst of all
'Cause she got married the following fall
She said ""For love"" but I got me doubts
I think the guitar chased her out
She's a game girl, though
Just couldn't take it, you know, limit to everything

Dad, he took it a different way
He said, you can turn your Mum's hair gray
Drive your sister away from home
But you or me boy's gonna start to roam
And I ain't going, never intend to
You figure it out, so I did, fast, you know

Anyway, next day had me clothes all packed
And I slung me guitar across me back
Caught myself a great long train
Searched the world for me share of fame
Ain't found none, just hardships, messing about

Whatever shall I do?
Hallelujah,

I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
The bonny burning question,
What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?

That he calls them daisy roots

And some of them forget

He hadn't gone but a few yards

In his great big hobnail boots

That he calls them daisy roots

And some of them forget

He spills some on the steps

I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

Or sue me when I cry,

I wish that I could die.

Where all blinds can see.

It will be a home for me.

In his great big hob nailed boots 
He's got such a job to pull 'em up 
That he calls 'em daisy roots 

Some folks give tips at christmas 
And some of them forget 
So when he picks their bins up 
He spills some on the step 
Now one old man got nasty

Get yourself a guitar and then you're right into it
You play all day and you play all night
People say you'll never learn to play the thing right
Always messing about, groaning at you
Moaning, won't let you practice

So I bought myself a guitar about a year ago
The man said I could learn it in a week or so
Gave me a little book, pick or two
Said, ""Here why'are mate, it's up to you""
Dirty rotter, cost me ten nicker, all the loot I had
Good guitar, though, called it a pluck it

Anyway, spent me dough
And I couldn't let it all go to waste, you know
So I took the book, guitar and all
And I went back home where the trees are tall
Down in Woodford, good place to be if you've got a guitar
Pretty rotten if you ain't

Well, for weeks and weeks I worked hard
And I tried to learn a few main chords
The book says they're easy as ABC
Cor, my fingers is killing me, got sore on the ends
Couldn't hold the strings down
Wanted to pack up, cor, I felt rough

Anyway, kept on playing with all me might
I could see Mum's hair was turning white
And her face was lined with discontent
She said her patience was pretty near spent
She was nervous, ears ringing, wanted to scream
You know, couldn't get no relief

So sister, anyway, she took it worst of all
'Cause she got married the following fall
She said ""For love"" but I got me doubts
I think the guitar chased her out
She's a game girl, though
Just couldn't take it, you know, limit to everything

Dad, he took it a different way
He said, you can turn your Mum's hair gray
Drive your sister away from home
But you or me boy's gonna start to roam
And I ain't going, never intend to
You figure it out, so I did, fast, you know

Anyway, next day had me clothes all packed
And I slung me guitar across me back
Caught myself a great long train
Searched the world for me share of fame
Ain't found none, just hardships, messing about

And so you're back from outer space

I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Oh, now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die?

I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Lonnie Gordon,"Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha' gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsiblity?
Will you spend your days and nights in the pool room?
Will you sell caps of madness to the neighborhood?
Little ghetto boy
You already know how proud life can be
'cause you've seen so much pain and misery

Little ghetto boy
Your daddy was blown away
He robbed that grocery store
Don't you know that was a sad, sad old day?
All your young life
You've seen such misery and pain
The world is a cruel place to live
And it ain't gonna change
You're so young
You've got so far to go on
And don't think you'll reach your goal
Young man, little ghetto boy, look at you

Little ghetto boy
When, when, when you become a men
You can make things change if you just take the stand
You gotta believe it yourself in all you do
You've gotta fight to make it better
Then you will see how others will start believing to
Then, my son, things will start to get better

Lonnie Johnson,"Little Jesse was a gambler, night and day
He used crooked cards and dice
Sinful guy, good hearted but had no soul
Heart was hard and cold like ice

Jesse was a wild reckless gambler
Won a gang of change
Altho' a many gambler's heart he led in pain
Began to spend a-loose his money
Began to be blue, sad and all alone
His heart had even turned to stone

What broke Jesse's heart while he was blue and all alone
Sweet Lorena packed up and gone
Police walked up and shot my friend Jesse down
Boys i got to die today

He had a gang of crapshooters and gamblers at his bedside
Here are the words he had to say

Guess I ought to know
Exactly how I wants to go
(How you wanna go, Jesse?)

Eight crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Let 'em be veiled down in black
I want nine men going to the graveyard, bubba
And eight men comin back

I want a gang of gamblers gathered 'round my coffin-side
Crooked card printed on my hearse
Don't say the crapshooters'll never grieve over me
My life been a doggone curse

Send poker players to the graveyard
Dig my grave with the ace of spades
I want twelve polices in my funeral march
High sheriff playin' blackjack, lead the parade

I want the judge and solic'ter who jailed me 14 times
Put a pair of dice in my shoes (then what?)
Let a deck of cards be my tombstone
I got the dyin' crapshooter's blues

Sixteen real good crapshooters
Sixteen bootleggers to sing a song
Sixteen racket men gamblin'

No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes, oh

I see a line of cars and they’re all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Painted black, black as night, black as coal

(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train
(I've seen better days)
What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away

I'm hanging on your every word

If I called us a cab right now?

Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
(I'm walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

Yo here goes some info on my flow and how I move 
to a def groove, I keep my rep smooth 
On the down-low, I travel with my mind to the street 
Concrete, like the gravel I'm in deep 
So I gotta hit ya from a real perspective 
Cause anyone who's talkin that crap, will surely get his 
I'm not the one to act flashy 
Cause man where I be at, we don't have to be classy 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I'm walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

Check it stupid 
While you're out there, on the main streets frontin 
Your game's week, so I'm huntin you down clown 
Cause you need to learn somethin 
All that bluffin, won't get you nothin but killed 
No mission fulfilled, because there's others who will 
get jealous, hell if they can take clout from you, they'll do it 
So that's what I'm about to do, I'll step to it 
and strip you of your pride (your pride) 
And then I'll stick and I'll rip you up from all sides 
or possibly I'll let you slide, slime 
Cause you'll set your own death in just a matter of time 
Yeah, and I'll be somewhere on the sidelines, y'know 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

So when you're lookin for me, here's where I'll be 
I'll be walkin down the backstreets in your vicinity 
Cause I been out here for a few 
So all that you're doin, ain't really nothin new (nothin new) 
I peeped the way you always perpetrate 
You're so phony, you make me wanna regurgitate 
Since you're ridin so high, you're bound to fall 
while I stand tall, and you don't get no props at all out here 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(It's the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(In your backstreets) 

Down the backstreets, is a mind state 
Cause I don't have to be a pop star to rhyme great 
I've been out here observin things 
So now all fake gangsters and pranksters I'm servin 
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm the king 
Come down the backstreets where it's dark 
I'ma snatch your heart 
So get a handle on life and quit livin so trife 
Or else we're gonna have to run up, and SMACK all the weak 
Comin straight from the backstreets 
And I'm out, ninety-three, it's all me ",Down the Backstreets,1993

She's a pretty thing and she knows everything

But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together

I'm nice to you, I could make it through
That you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me baby

Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight

But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too

Lonnie Lynn,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees

I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

Lonnie Plaxico,"Too young to go steady, too young
I hear him (her) say.
He (she) says I'm (we're) not ready
But then why am I (are we) feeling this way?

Too young so he (she) tells me
He (she) says we'll have to wait.
Why wait till it may be too late?

Can't he (she) realize he (she) drive me wild
Is he (she) made of stone?
Must he (she) always treat me (act just) like a child?

Won't he (she) ever own up
I'm (we're) grown up?
Some day he'll (she'll) be sorry
Some day just wait and see
He'll (she'll) wish he'd (she'd) gone steady with me!

Lonnie Plaxico,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2004

Dreaming in the color of the dress you wore
I wake up harmed and wanting more about you

I don't wanna… feel alive
I don't wanna… feel naked

When the dawn breaks
I can feel the heat of your sun rising
Rising up inside me
I can feel the waves of your heart rushing
Rushing over me
Rushing over me
Rushing over me
Rushing over me

And the subway dies
The clock stops ticking and the traffic sighs

Lonzo & Oscar,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All,1965

Looking Glass,"There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say: ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""

Made of finest silver from the North of Spain

When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its ragin' glory

And still not know what's goin' on

Stay lookin' for the loot to steal

Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'

Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits

Never say bye to me
I can't deny shorty love is official
Even though love ain't the issue
Shorty still smuggle the pistol
Pass you the gat then hug you and kiss you
Show you love when other niggas will diss you
You on the real
That's the type chick a nigga need 
The type smoke all a nigga weed
And still move at a nigga's speed
Never a victim of a nigga's greed
Especially if she runnin' 'round with a nigga's seed

I need a girl who'll ride for me (Keep her self real fly)
Damn near die for me (Staying by my side)
Go to court for me (Stand up and cry)
Pay my bail for me, make sales for me
Have a baby with me (This is what she'll do)
Not too industry (Be my baby momma too)
Someone who'll never leave (And always be true)
How I wish my wife could be you

I had a girl that would have died for me
I didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would have had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild, now these days that I reminisce
About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)
But long as you happy I'mma tell you this
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix (Mamacita)

I need a girl who'll ride for me (Keep her self real fly)
Damn near die for me (Staying by my side)
Go to court for me (Stand up and cry)

Have a baby with me (This is what she'll do)
Not too industry (Be my baby momma too)
Someone who'll never leave (And always be true)
How I wish my wife could be you

Now I done seen chicks come and go
Some in it for the love and some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low
I'm a tell you how it really be
'Cause I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be
This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the Prada mamis
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale
(But I'mma ride for you daddy) Then I got you mami
'Cause all I want to do is take care of you
And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do
Like if I rock ice you gon' wear it too
Fuck with me I have the whole world stare at you (You feel me girl?)

I need a girl who'll ride for me (Keep her self real fly)

[P. Diddy]
why y'all niggas still talking?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

[G. Dep]
This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you living an illusion, living in a used one
while I'm in the Limited, cruising
You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said, I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

[Black Rob]
Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice
the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga

Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I used to kiss them pretty lips

Since I heard your voice last summer
To be honest it made me smile
When I seen you not with her (hey, baby, you know I miss you)

Will you tell me what I should feel
Instead of being your regret (you know)?

Been mackin hos, nigga Loon a pimp go ask the hos
Nigga you's a simp, cause your smack the hos (yeah)
And lose your temper like John McEnroe
Me, I'm cool I keep my jewels intact (c'mon)
Loon ain't type of dude that'll move like that (that's right)
Don't compare me to no boozy cat
Cause Loon'll call them dudes, come use them gats
Remember the time when I didn't use to rap
You know me, O.G., O.T. movin past
As far as the street, I already proved that fact
Not to be rude, but I ain't in the mood for that
Movin on to bigger songs, bigger things
Use my arm for bigger charms, bigger rings
Usually calm, but when it's on, nigga trained
To drop the bomb, word to my mom
Ya'll niggaz playin

Yeah, Bad Boy
Yeah, come on now

[Loon]
Now what's your forte, chicks they all say
That they want a nigga, sip Cris' all day
This be all great, merely kiss for foreplay
When I slip and slide with this chick from Norway
Whips I push, make the bitch's jaw sway
Then I hit they bush, leave 'em drippin all day
Then I get like Bush, when I flip the war play
Fuck the horse play, hot sex in hallways
Pick your spot now, got you hot now
Since you locked down, roof put the top down
I know you eager to leave this hot town
Know how you feel we can leave or not now
First you was fiendin, but screamin stop now
Walls got knocked down, when I laid my cock down
Spendin my cheese while you breathin shop round
I can't believe that you screamin cop now

Yo, in one year I gave you bastards, two classics
Between me, Puff and Usher it was too drastic
Between me, Puff and Gin was true magic (yeah you remember her)
Cause everybody +Needed a Girl+ but who asked em
You was scured, basically you wasn't prepared
To gettin murried and havin a couple of chirls
I'm a grown man nigga, I ain't never concerned
About how nice your ice, or the money you earn
I'm the slim guy, spend years reppin N.Y
So you just start pullin on blunts, I've been high
You just start visitin spots, I've been by
And the hell with a throwback nigga, I've been fly

Definitely real, spend time in Beverly Hills
Been gettin money since Tiffany Mills
I've got a debt to fulfill

I might peel wole left of your grill
With no mercy, niggaz don't know I'm so thirsty
Sticks and stones break bones but don't hurt me
Niggaz want to clap they chrome but won't murk me
Niggaz keep frontin like Loon won't get dirty

Loon,"Ma, I tried so many years
But it seems like all I brought you is tears
I tried to eliminate all of your fears but it's conflict
Yeah, check it out, uh, yo

Aiyyo, the game keep callin', niggaz in the streets is ballin'
Tryin' to creep just to keep from fallin'
But the block keep hollerin', yellin' my government name
I tried to stop but the love of the game

They got my girl in a frenzy, my niggaz used to be friendly
'Til they seen me and Puff in the Bentley
Now, forced to stay, forces use force and spray
Coffins lay when I'm forced to play

Like an animal, dawg, if I put my hand on you
I'ma handle you, like I'm Hannibal, the motherfuckin' cannibal
All plans is through, dreams and goals
The block hot but why this shit seem so cold

This shit seems so old, tryna redeem my soul
The Feds roll and my team done fold
Like a bad hand of poker, even ya man'll smoke ya
For these crushed up leaves of coca, now

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Yo, check it out
It's been four years and you ain't shed no tears
And through the course of that, I lost four pairs
That's why I smoke more blunts, drink more beers
You never consider it, like you just don't care

The pain I feel inside, you just don't share
When I share my deepest thought, you just don't hear
Well aware of my fears of me losin' my life
I'm well aware of my fears of me losin' my wife

That's why I stay usin' my gun and usin' my knife
Gotta deal with this shit 'til my music get right
I buy you pretty things just to see you wear it
You sayin' I ain't shit, tryna break my spirit

I try to change my life but you just don't hear it
Guess I gotta find another girl to spend four years with
Damn, all that time got wasted but I guess I gotta face it

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Uh, yo, uh, aiyyo
The cops don't like me, they always eager to fight me
Even though I know they wanna be like me
'Cause they see a nigga icy, doin' a buck in the white V
Twizzy gettin' busy with wifey, gettin' head on the highway

I'm gettin' money to fly away
Pull me over just to fuck up my Friday
What could I say? Nothin', still they be frontin'
Throw a brick in the trunk and try to make up somethin'

But I'm not with the bullshit, that's why I roll with a full clip
Flint cock the hammer and pull quick
Don't care about your uniform or that bullshit you be on
Now who gon' really mourn when you be gone?

One in your head like a unicorn
You movin' on, your favorite suit is on
Moms singin' that stupid song, ""My baby ain't blast nobody""
But he still got smoked at Bay Bay's party, that's why

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Loon,"[Intro - Loon - talking]
Uh, check it out, yeah
Let me tell you a little story
A little couple street tales, ya know
On the shit I be seein
Cause yo I'm from Harlem and everyday I see shit yo
This, check it, uh

[Verse 1 - Loon]
Now here's a story about a young kid, had everything in life
Never had to ask for nothin more than twice
His pops was gettin it, moms was a lawyer
And his ball game almost got him draft to the Hoyas
He fell in love with this chick named Latoya
But little did he know, Latoya was a ho
Lotta shit about Latoya he don't know
She fucked with some nigga named Bo, who sold blow
But the day he found out, turned the town out
Ran up on Bo and his ass got pound out
But yo when he came through, he seen the devil in disguise
It was Bo with the devil in his eyes
Mack 11 on his side, him and seven other guys
And every last one of these niggaz ready to ride
Beside the fact, that this cat in the mix
His jaw all broke up but that could be fixed
Drawers all soaked up, cause that nigga pissed
Full force, cocked back the rap nigga shit
Now perhaps nigga flipped or perhaps nigga cried
But deep down this nigga didn't really want to die

[Chorus - Female voice]
Niggaz get a little bit of loot, then think they fly
Then they want to claim they thugs, but they really don't want to die

Niggaz get a little bit of loot, and then think they fly
Then they want to claim they thugs, but they really don't want to die

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Uh, yeah, uh
Now here's a story about another nigga by the name of Jermaine
This nigga pushin thirty and still in the game
He won't change, all he do is sniff cocaine
Recruit niggaz outta school and poison they brain
I'm sayin any nigga fuckin with Jermaine
This nigga have you hustle in the rain, or bust a nigga brain
This duke was a menace in fact
But these Dominican cats could finish him black
Cause he didn't finish them packs, didn't finish that weight
The kid he had picture, caught ten in the face
Him and his ace, walk around with Mack 10 in they waist
But pop never been a disgrace
Word to mother, he got contract killers, combat niggaz
They kill if a whole fifth of Coniac liquor
Skipped town thinkin they wouldn't harm that nigga
Found out they know where your mom's at nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Loon]
The last story Samantha, type of chick that you pamper
Got a lotta junk in her Pamper
Pops was a Panther, her mom's some happy camper
That thought the whole world of Samantha
Moved to Atlanta, at the age of 18
Got a couple girls and they formed the A-team
Some play things, specialize in blazin
Her and her girlfriend Mayling from Beijing
They was bugged, harrassin the scrubs
Everybody knew about Samantha and clubs
Gullible, get Samantha some drugs
And you could take her home, get Samantha some love
Back shots, yo Samantha don't budge
Probably all the niggaz that Samantha done fucked
Lotta kids, she done twist lotta ways
'Til she found out she HIV positive

Yeah I see you girl, why you lookin at me
And why your man in the club lookin trigger happy
It's a shame you don't hear me though
And I'm far from a lame, I'ma gigolo
I get paid just to spit the flow
And I can't even explain when I get at yo
You know how long I've been gettin dough?
Used to rock full length mink with the finger low (okay)
Yep that's my forte, and chicks know Loon best at foreplay
I get hugs and kisses all day, trips to Norway, sip Crisses all day (woo)
Plus wrists be all gray, plus five speed shiftin all day
And my mind is right, if you ain't about no money, better find a life, aight

[Chorus - Missy Elliott] - w/ ad libs

When they tell that money in your pocket, okay

(Female voice: Oh girl, that's Loon)

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Uh, check it out yo, check it out now
Why's you all on me, friends is all on me
Pissy drunks spillin alcohol on me
Tried to split but the chick keep callin me
Cause I be everything a baller be
Please believe me, my team is cheesy
Please be easy, me and Pee Wee easily
Like 'em red bone, short and sleezy
Get my second cup, start talkin greezy
We come consistent, young, relentless
No resistance, girls run from distance
When we come through, pimp hard like Michigan
And sip Dom, wrists armed, we glistenin
This chick on, this Dom, got Mrs. and
They silk on, that non new trenches and
High heel stilettos, I feel so ghetto
But switch to soft, couldn't get them off me

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
[Verse 3 - P. Diddy]
Hey yo, can I get some of this playboy

P.D. back up for par Dolce jar
Girls and Bob dog, what's up with the bar
Midori forty-five degrees with cigar (uh huh)

Bad Boy maxim with all of our splendor
Got some real shit for all why'all pretenders
Harlem heartthrob that's shock when it's slender
Flow like August, with arms like December
Twelve years playboy got more to remember

Loon,"Loon la lean aka young Marcus
Young, pretty and heartless
And my man CTzy
He make it seem to easy
And the general P D-I double D-why
See why we be fly

Now you can hum all you want to, cum all you want to
But I ain't Mase so run all you want to
Sit there act all dumb if you want to
Spend your whole life in the slums if you want to
I eat good, eat crumbs if you want to
And keep wastin' time with the bums if you want to
I got long though, you know how the song go
My name hold weight, far from a John Doe
It so strange how the game made my arm grow
Used to live in cell blocks, now I live in condos
And every morning I feel like Alonzo
Number one on the pop charts and your moms know
Every time I pull up, there's a car show
Young cats, stay lookin' like the head honcho
My escargot my car go one-sixty
The world's Fargo Parto
Me and Puff like the ""Lone Ranger, Tonto""
Leave the club and we leave with a whole car load
And we got better ratings than a new gong show
But right now you got to let my arm go, see'mon ma

[Chorus:]
I know what you've been through
Sometimes love is so cruel
(Sometimes)
Oh, yes it is
(Oh, yes it is)
I know I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you
(Gonna be there for you baby)
Oh yes I will (oh woo woo)

Uh, check it out
You choose to lose, only 'cause you confused
If you was with me, I'd probably go abuse them dude
But you runnin' 'round 'busin' shoes
'Stead of 22's that cruise
How you gon' abuse the rude
Girl you runnin' with some popular dude
Poppin' bottles of Voo
Now you seen me and you not in the mood
Girl he has you on the block with his dudes
Different watches to choose
Baby girl I think you got me confused
That's like a chair to a sofa
Ma tell her Oprah, seein' Russell in a pair of loafers
It's evident, that's irrelevant, you was elegant
Taught you proper etiquette, for the hell of it
It's like you feel me, but you not smellin' it
I try to talk but you stay on some yellin' shit
Then you complain about the things that Helen get
Leave me and get the same treatment a felon get

[Chorus:]

Uh, yo
Yo I'm the type when I come through
Mami I do what I want to
As far as you if I want you
Now I ain't come here to haunt you
So you can have a attitude if you want to
I'ma have you, reason why
All four seasons I'm fly
I'ma player, ain't no reason to lie
Ain't no reason for you breezin' on by
Without squeezin' a ""hi""
'Cause I could tell by the gleam in your eye
You like cats with dough that fold up
22's when they roll up
Ma you need to slow up, hold up
Here's a proposition, on the real ma, he got to listen
I know he's loud, cause the top is missin'
But you could be in the Tropics fishin'
By the sea, mami poppin' Crisses
Though it seem kinda optimistic
I got green and a pot to piss in
Fuck with me, you got a lot to witness
'Cause I'ma have you

[Chorus:]
I know what you've been through
Sometimes love is so cruel
(Sometimes love)
Oh, yes it is
(Sometimes, oh yeah)
I know I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you
(I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you)
Oh yes I will (oh, yes I will)

Wa hoo, I know that love
Don't give you a fan sometimes
Sometimes what you gotta, what you gotta
You gotta reach down and play it with your poker face

Loon,"Yeah, check it out, uh yo

Yo, I was sittin' on the block with the deuce-deuce, the bubble goose
Nigga popped up in the blue Coupe, this nigga Moose
This nigga fishy, this nigga he stay pissy
Run up behind niggaz, the blizzy and get busy
I seen niggaz resent, some nigga wrist be broke over this coke
Or pocket full of crispy
Dollar bills make nigga swallow the steel
And most niggaz can't swallow a pill, know how that feel?
But back to the skit nigga, in back of the whip
With the windows half way down about to clap on some shit
And I'm rappin' and shit to this platinum chick
It was fucked up, I got shorty back of the whip
I'm paranoid but still got the gat and the clip
If them niggaz spit, I got to spit back at the whip
If it go down, shorty whole back'll get ripped
And that's low down, real life theatrical shit
So I grabbed shorty hand, took a couple of paces
Said some ""Hail Mary"" maintain my patience
Oh shit, this nigga spit four quick
I threw shorty down and let off the whole clip
Then reloaded but holdin' the whole whip
In broad day, so niggaz done witnessed the whole shit
Had to flee this shit is blasphemy
I took a couple of steps and the nigga blasted me
This nigga Moose got loose from the caboose
Ain't thinkin' about a truce, try to knock my dick loose
My deuce-deuce ain't fuckin' with Moose point forty
I try to save the chick but the nigga done lose shorty
Two to her gut, one to her chest, one to her head
Now shorty layin' puddles of red, fuck it I'm fed
I'm tryna figure was it somethin' I said
That got this dumb nigga bustin' out lead, discussion is dead
I understand this man, he got a cannon in his hand
The sound alone, this shit is bananas
My one plan was to hit him and run fam
But God saved my life, when he made his gun jam
Time to leave but he still tryna squeeze
Instead of tryna buy him some time on his knees
Nigga please, you got no reason to buck up
Knowin' that you 'bout to get shot the fuck up
Duke was brave but his stupid ways
Is the reason why I'm 'bout to twist Duke toupee
And I'ma squeezin' but the gun wouldn't shot no strays
Now we even but the nigga like six two, what would you do?
I'm 'bout to out fox this nigga
Son at one sixty-five, I'ma box this nigga
But what he don't know, Loon 'bout to ox this nigga
Hit him dead in his fuckin neck, when I chop this nigga
But thoughts in my mind, tellin' me let it slide
So I'ma get in my ride and catch Duke another time
Just circle the block smoke a purple of choc
This nigga heart stop, nigga died right on the spot
No bullshit, collapse right on the block
Crackheads went in his slacks, hit him right in his knot
Save me the trouble, now my phone on bubble (they comin' for you)
Feds tappin' my line, like nigga condone the trouble
Walk out my motherfuckin' home is a struggle
Fuck them pigs, I don't own no shovel

What the fuck
Now all that bullshit I done been through with this nigga
I ain't lay a single solitary motherfuckin' hand on this nigga
This nigga drops dead, these motherfuckers is all on my ass
Like I did somethin' to this nigga
Word to my mother, this shit is some real bullshit man
This nigga killed my motherfuckin' bitch
Now I'm runnin' around like motherfuckin' Harrison Ford
Like I'm some motherfuckin' ""Fugitive"" or somethin' man
This is some real bullshit man

I like, hey, hey, I like
Oh, I like ya baby, I like
Ah, hey, baby, I like, yea

Check it out
There was a reason I like you
And there's a reason I wifed you
'cause I never seen nothin' like you
So sweet, my team even like you
There's no limit to the things that I might do

And that's why you stay in the finest
Everything major, never in the minors
We dine on yachts, far from them diners
I'm by your side far from behind ya

And I ain't gotta buy cars to remind ya
Gas you up and put your heart in the grinder
You don't know what you mean to me, girl
'cause you more like a queen to me

And I want you to cling to me
'cause you came here, you changed my scenery
It was just like a dream to me, that's what it seemed to be
You need a ring, it not a thing to me

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you

Girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave
I'm on my hands and knees

And now I'm back by popular demand
Rocks is in your hand, so let 'em know, girl, you gotta man
Even though you know I got a lot of fans
See me in the club with the bottles in my hand

Models on the side tryin' to holla if they can
Get a nigga home, try to swallow if they can
But you know they can't holla at your man
I'm focused so they can't bother without plans

White sand, we done, did that
London, did that, Sandrope, we done, did that
Went to Sydney and dropped dough
Trips to Morocco, Paris popped more, we did that

So ain't nothin' else left to do
But spend the rest of my life and invest in you
I know them haters be testin' you
But don't let nobody stress you, boo
You know they like that

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you, girl

Aeyo, now that we made our bond
It might sound crazy, ma, but it's time to get our baby on
It's time to get a life together
'cause you gon be my wife forever

'cause I made up my mind, it's crazy at times
Visions of you and a baby of mine
Half the hassle, livin' in half a castle
There's no way to act or pass you

I'm blessed to have you, pain that I loved done last through
Can't nothin in the world surpass you
I have to ask you, please be my only girl
I can't breathe in this lonely world

'cause I'm often hounded, concerts surrounded
By chicks that think Loon is astounding
But without you, ma, Loon won't be grounded
Loon would be runnin' round clownin'

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way the feelings good things from you, girl

I like the way you wear your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Way you kiss me I feel warm
Give me all your lovin' all night long

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way

[Verse 1]
How I'm gon' forget my muscle, I just had to switch my hustle
And try to make hits that crush you, and dance like Nipsey Russell
And have Puff doin the hustle, I do what I must do
I keeps my shit consistent, I keeps my listeners listenin
My rocks be glistenin, I come through blocks be hissin
But niggaz can't stop my mission
My main intention, is to make niggaz pay attention
I don't want to call my henchman
I got some French men, that come through put some French in
Or Muslim to burn nigga body like incense
If Loon dies, wolves come out like moon rise
And make niggaz hard to find like moon pie
If you wise nigga, you'll move like two pies
Then to stand here and keep on lookin in Loon eyes

[Chorus] - 2X (with second time starting with ""now"")
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
I'm just another brother that's out to get cash
The goal of the street is to hold ya own
If you smart, then you never got to hold no chrome

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, now this verse I feel I owe you
You tryna get dough I show you, even if I don't know you
Tell you couple things I go through
And maybe you can get some dough too, just spit your vocals
And do the shit Tone and Poke do, or get a nigga work the pro tools
I chose a local, nigga that's probably broke to
So this way a nigga could blow to
I beg to differ, you the type nigga bread get thicker
Top of that, nigga head get bigger
Go 'head then nigga, you don't know where you headin nigga
Last year you was a beggin nigga
Never said the nigga was even close to bein bred from nigga
You got a plan, get ya bread then nigga
I fed you niggaz, just like Moses when I led you niggaz
I could see why niggaz dread you niggaz, uh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ha, ha, haha, never find that funny (why?)
Girl you know I works hard for my money (hmm)
You callin me a thief please, don't even try it
Find ya groupie ass a seat and be quiet
She almost got cut short, you know scissors
For stuntin on that kid, who neck look like lizard
That young Harlem nigga, who lifestyle exquisite
And all the young ladies can't wait to come visit
Loon, I stay on ass like sassoon
Mansion with 22 rooms in Cancun
Handsome, I keep the girls glancin and dancin
Prone to rock stone when I blow my advancement
Never alone, either home or romancin
Nigga get in the zone when I'm rollin my Branson
And yo chances of you gettin this shit is no chances
You better get a drink and go dancin

[Chorus]",This Ain't Funny,2003
Loon,"[Intro - Loon - talking]
Yeah, see a lotta finger pointin goin on
A lot of judgment bein passed
Niggaz don't even know what their fuckin talkin 'bout
I go by the name of Loon
And I represent this Bad Boy shit
'Til the motherfuckin casket drop
Damn right, uh, aiyyo, aiyyo

[Verse 1]
Niggaz don't know me, it's time that I give you the first taste
In case niggaz suffer the worst case
Harlem my birthplace, I used to run with niggaz that hurt Mase
I started ""Harlem World"" in the first place
Niggaz was thirsty, jumped out the window
Indoed the fuck up, it cost they friends yo
Cause that's how friends go
But niggaz tryna get they ends yo
Forget about the nigga that lent yo
Ask for dollar, now you want to holla cause your ends low
But look at how far your friends go
Killer is doin it, nigga Loon drop bitches is losin it
Keep the tool cocked, niggaz is usin it
Only if it's a must, nigga front, put they dick in the dust
That's what you get, fuck with niggaz like us
Loon that nigga that bust, even though you think that nigga just lust
These chicks, after I hit, I put the bitch on the bus

[Chorus]
(Oh you don't know who the fuck I be?)
Oh it's the L, double O, N, representin the NYC
(Any nigga disrespect my G's)
Son a nigga get jacked, nigga get crapped, even dumped in the sea
(Oh you don't know what the fuck I know?)
When it come to the dough, nigga I'ma pro, when I step to them hoes
(Oh you don't know what the fuck I do?)
To a nigga like you thinkin your crew gon' do somethin to Loon

[Verse 2]
I'm glad Puff let me get to my gat
Cause now I'm 'bout to give 'em my pack
Get in the 'Lac, sit in the back
Ride around with my shit in my lap
The first nigga react, the first nigga act, nigga get clapped
I don't get down with you niggaz like that
So all that yikkety-yak, a nigga front, gun clickety clack
Make it hard for you niggaz that rap
Cause when you gotta pick up the slack
Pick up a pack or pick up a plaque
You ain't think my flow could pick up like that
The way I stick to a track, the impeller gettin hit with a bat
One swing'll bring your shit to your lap
And make you shit in your slacks
Your body shape forever zip and your trapped
Let me tell you about the difference in rap
And the difference is street, niggaz that creep
Bust your shit with the heat
If I find out a nigga soft and he sweet
I'm knockin 'em off their feet
Snatchin his bitch and ridin off with his Jeep

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uh, yeah, aiyyo you frontin like you seen stacks
Deep down, you's a clown and you don't need to feed back
Hey yo, y'all niggaz need to ease back
Now how you come with your guns and your ones, and your sons like you squeeze gats
Niggaz don't believe that, and them bitches don't believe that
That's why you ride with your seat back
Niggaz don't like you, they probably put a bullet right through
ya motherfuckin chest with they rifle, niggaz livin trifle
And last year 'round this time, we did it to a nigga just like you
Lean like the Eiffel, scream on you like your wife do
Gleam on you like the ice do, I might seem like a nice dude
Even though niggaz know, got a nigga eighteen that'll knife you
Split nigga ass crack, picture we waitin on ass cap
When you could get it like the last cat, rat a tat tat

[Chorus] - 2X",You Don't Know,2003

Is about a young man
Who's endured a lot of twists and turns in his life
Cause he always kept his head up, stayed focused
This man's name is Mario Winans, listen

[Chorus]
What makes you think I can't make it?
Put me to the test, I'll take it
I've been through more trials
But I've overcome all of them
And I've never been one for faking
I kept on moving and shaking
And that's how I made it

I've seen it all
But I never let no one
Tell me it's right, when it's wrong
Cause I heard it all before
And it gives me a reason to fight for
A right for, to do what I gotta do

[Chorus]

All of my life
I was told that you had to go through
Just to get where you want
And if you come across a storm
You just gotta keep holding on, and stay strong
And do what you gotta do

[Chorus]

Hey yo I came from the bottom, worked my way up
Ran wit big dudes, had to get my weight up
Now my cake up, now it's lights, cameras, make up
Trips to Jacob, foreign countries
Reminisce of times when we all was hungry
Now I made it, and all y'all niggaz can hate it
Seeing that I sound like Mase and
Knowing that I came from the basement
Did my own thing, so face it
Now they coming wit cases, now wit this hand I'm racist
I'm so close I can taste it
Sometimes I just wanna grab toast and take it
But I'm a keep moving and shaking

Cuenta una leyenda
Que una hembra gitana
Conjuró a la luna hasta el amanecer
Llorando pedía
Al llegar el día
Desposar un calé

Tendrás a tu hombre piel morena
Desde el cielo habló la luna llena
Pero a cambio quiero
El hijo primero
Que le engendres a él
Que quien su hijo inmola
Para no estar sola
Poco le iba a querer

Que te haga mujer

Gitano al creerse deshonrado
Se fue a su mujer cuchillo en mano
De quién es el hijo?
Me has engañado fijo
Y de muerte la hirió
Luego se hizo al monte
Con el niño en brazos
Y allí le abandonó

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Looper,"We kept seeing Columbo's car around. First of all we saw it outside Burger King on Byres Road, badly parked- about five feet away from the kerb and at the craziest angle, as if he'd stopped there in a hurry. Then my brother saw it outside the place where the swimming pool and the badminton courts are. And later again I saw it parked outside the off-licence, closer to the pavement this time, and parallel too. We only ever saw the car parked, but it always seemed to be outside somewhere I liked to go. And then, when we went out for dinner on wee Karn's birthday and we were hanging our coats up on the coat-rack, we saw Columbo's old mac already hanging there, in amongst all the expensive fur and leather and things. I had a quick look around while we were being taken to our table, to see if he was there, but I couldn't see him anywhere.

But then one night while I was sitting outside on the steps playing my Game Boy, I heard a car stopping on the gravel in front of me. And while I tried to decide which way round to put the L-shaped Tetris piece that was falling, I felt someone sit down on the steps beside me. And I heard them scratching their head. And then, on the reflection on the screen, I saw that it was him.

""Those really are the most fascinating little machines."" he said. But I'd built up a whole high pile, which needed a single line for down the side, and I couldn't look up in case it came. ""It certainly is nice around here."" Columbo said, and I heard his mac moving as he looked around. The single line I'd been waiting for didn't come though, and soon my screen was filled all the way to the top. So I put it down and asked Columbo if someone from around here had been murdered.

""Not murdered, sir. No."" he said, ""I don't think you could call it murder."" 

""Well what are you investigating?"" I asked him.

""Well, sir, it's a case of counterfeit notes. Perhaps you'd call it theft, but I'm not rightly sure. It's new for me, I'll tell you that."" Then he picked up the Game Boy and stared at it, all fascinated. ""Could I? Would you mind?"" he said, and I showed him how to start up a game. But pretty soon the screen was full and he shook his head. ""Well, well..."" he said, ""You know, Mrs Columbo- she's great at these sorts of things. But me, I just can't seem to get the hang of them."" And he stood up and handed it back to me. ""I'm sorry to have troubled you, sir."" he said, ""I'll let you get back to your game. You know, this really is a lovely area."" And as he walked off down the steps I watched until he opened the door of his car, and I went to start up another game. But then he stopped. ""Oh, I'm sorry."" he said, holding one hand up in the air, with a cigar between his fingers, and looking down at the ground. ""Just a little thing..."" he said. And he scratched the back of his head with the hand that had been up in the air. ""With something like that, sir- that little machine you have there- would someone be able to make samples with that, from records and stuff?"" I laughed and shook my head. ""That's fine, sir."" he said, ""I was just curious."" Then he got into the car and drove away. 

I didn't think I'd see him again after that, but I was very wrong. I began to see his car around a lot more, quite often outside the houses of people I knew. And not only that, but just lately he's started turning up wherever I might be, asking me all kinds of crazy questions about technology and sampling and stuff. Pretending he's trying to learn all about it. It got me quite worried for a while, but I think I'll be alright. I think I've got him foxed. I think I've been way too clever for him...",Columbo's Car,1999
Looper,"Drunk, and lying outside on the lawn-

Dave the Moonman.

He'd look up at the blurred stars, as the dew on the grass soaked through the back of his jacket and the back of his trousers, and then he'd look towards the moon. All that distance from the surface he was pinned down on to the surface glowing in the darkness, with nothing but space all the way in between. Nothing to hold onto. And yet, someone had managed to get there. Someone had managed to do that. A truly impossible thing. So he'd get up out of the grass, light-hearted again. It made everything else possible. Anything you could think of, anything you were stuck with, it could be done. Because that had been done. Someone had got up and gone to the moon. And nothing else was more impossible than that.

Dave the Moonman.

But sober and playing around on the internet he started to find bits and pieces, Dave the Moonman. Things about the Van-Allen Belt, and about Kodak film and dual light sources. And he talked to people who knew about similar stuff, and he read bits in magazines and books.

The first time I met him was at a party. He was surrounded by a group of people and he was giving short lectures about all the stuff he had learned, going round the party one group at a time with all the energy of someone newly-born to a religion. You had to wait your turn if you wanted him to tell you about it, so I waited my turn.

The first thing was the Van-Allen Belt, he said; an outer layer of the atmosphere that all the shuttle flights stay inside, that protects the earth from radiation. He raid somewhere that if the astronauts had really gone beyond that, and gone all the way to the moon, the radiation would have killed them soon afterwards. Then there were the photographs of the astronauts walking on the moon. He said you could tell from the shadows that the light sources were all wrong, which suggested studio lighting. And there was something about the photograph of the footprint too. If a moon boot could leave such a deep impression on the surface of the moon, then the thrust of the rocket when it was landing should have forced two big mounds up on either side of the rocket. But there are none in the pictures. 

There was a whole load of stuff. A whole load of stuff more than that. And so he was coming to believe it was a hoax, and that no-one had ever been to the moon.

I thought he had a mission, Dave the Moonman, to prove to everyone that no-one had ever landed on the moon. But that wasn't it at all. He was telling everyone all this stuff he'd learned cause he was hoping someone could prove to him it was wrong, and it wasn't just a hoax. Cause dreaming was so much harder otherwise. And it was so much harder to find the belief to get things done- lying out on the lawn at night, drunk, with the dew soaking through the back of your jacket. And all that distance between here and there. And he really wanted to believe that people had travelled to the moon in that crazy rocket, that looked as if it was made out of tin-foil and cardboard. He really wanted to believe that they'd managed to get it there, just by strapping enough fuel on, even though today you probably wouldn't trust it to get you down the shops.

Looper,"There are some days that catch the light,

Days like diamonds.

I saw a girl amongst the pillars, as I was climbing up the stairs. But just when I saw her she hid behind one of the pillars, so I went to see if I could find her. But she kept walking around the pillar at the same speed as I was walking, so that she stayed invisible. Then eventually she stopped and I caught up with her- and that was how the day began.

There are some days that catch the light,

As if someone's put a magic spell on them,

So that all of these kind of ordinary things

Seem like magic things.

We went to this pub that was very dark inside, me and this girl from amongst the pillars. And while she was telling me this story about someone's belly-button, this looper-man came up and said to me, ""Can I get in to use the phone there, unless of course you have a pigeon.""

And then we tried to get in to see a play which didn't start until the next day, and after that we queued for a different one beside a sign which said it was sold out.

We ended up at a street market, looking at curious bottles, where a woman behind a hat-pin stall mistook us for a couple in love, me and the girl from amongst the pillars. And we saw a man walking along the pavement with the most incredible moustache in the whole world, and another man rode a penny farthing along the street.

Some days are good,

They're like an adventure.

When it got dark some people were putting on a show outside, and we stood outside the fence thinking about climbing over it cause we couldn't afford to pay to get in. But just before the show began the ticket collectors moved away from the gates, and we managed to sneak in for free.

It was a great show. There were skeletons and beggars on high stilts, and they set fire to a tower they'd built while loud bells rang and sad cellos played. And then, near the end, they tied candle-lanterns to balloons and let them go up into the air. And I watched the lanterns instead of the show til they disappeared, which took a long time.

And two of the candles were still burning when they went out of sight.

Looptroop,"[Verse One]
Even when we not on tour I'm sleeping on the floor
Always on the road, on the couch, or with some girl I don't know
Hear myself say - I gotta go, I gotta leave, we gotta roll
a restless soul, mom I love you, promise I'll give you a call
once we checked out, sound checked, checked in the hotel room
Yeah, I know you want that same kind of perfume
off course I'll get it, get my brother on the phone
Tell grandma I'll help her with that garden stuff as soon as I'm home
We'll sit down and talk when I'm in Västerås
I don't know when, but once I'll get, I'll send you my schedule for shows
I'll call the booking right away, I'm going down to Jay in Malmoe
meet up with the guys in Gothenburg, work on the album
They say, home is where you're heart at, don't know where to start at
got loved ones all over, cross oceans and borders
I mean I love to travel, hate to fly, I want to go, but hate goodbyes
plus it's getting worse - Looptroop is on the rise
At times you'd like to press pause, no more ciaos and adios
but I'll be back in bit, now I'm out, business calls

[Chorus]
I gotta fly away. Gotta catch the train. We gotta catch the plane
but I really can't complain. We gotta fly away. Pack my bags today
We gotta ride the wave. See you in a couple of days

[Verse Two]
I'm sorry for all I'm sorrys that came too late
I'm sorry for the times that I went away
but yo, I'm still here cus my love came to stay
Remember that even though the weather is grey today
I know we had some situations and I hate to say
that I don't know the answers and how to erase the pain
Close your eyes for the things that led us astray
Then open them up towards a straighter way
All I ever wanted was to hear you say my name
Capture this second we'll forever stay the same
I take the blame for all my great escapes
there's a high price to pay for travellin´ state to state
I'm gone right now but you won't wait in vain
I'll be back before you know it to put the aches on layaway
Don't be afraid I know we'll remain ok
till I'll be back keep in touch through the radio waves

[Chorus]
Sometimes I fly away, but don't cry babe, cus you know I love you girl and
you know that you're my world. It's just you and me, that's the way we
supposed to be

[Verse Three]
You flew away like you were scared that I would clip your wings
after five years we haven't kicked it since
but straight up this ain't no pimpin' thing:
You a true queen baby only fit for kings
Maybe I couldn't see in the midst of things
now in my chain of life you're the missin' link
Just to hear your voice used to lift my chin
and I still feel the taste from when I kissed your skin
I'm looking at your picture wishing we'd click again
next time I make sure to get our shit in synch
next time I be your man through the thick and thin
I promise no more committing wicked sins
I buy you a house with a picket fence
get you everything you could give me twins
No bullshit on tour never hittin' skins
chasin' no groupies with chicken wings
Not the type to chain you between bed and kitchen sink
I merely praise the place where your lips begin
Your hips begin - I know you're quick to think:
It's pathetic, but I'd be the richest prince
if you once more unzip and let me sip your drink
Addicted to your love worse than nicotine
But there's too much pain for me to dig within
so I'm a let the music massage my crippled limbs..

[Chorus + Outro]
and just fly away, into my hideaway
sometimes I lie awake and cry the night away
why you had to fly away?
Now you miles away
You took my smile away
why couldn't you have stayed?",Fly Away,2002

Get ready! Live 'n let live for a sec!

But get ready! Your kind will debate bout you
Get ready! Don't mind what they say bout you
Get ready! You'll find it true when you grow up a little

Move into mountain hilltops
Leave Babylon cus on the route we on
We're heading for disaster faster than the Autobahn
I'm out to warn scream and shout: it's on!
Start the revolution now or ain't no doubt we gone
Then what good did it do to rep our hoods little crew
Dis other rappers say: I'm better than you!
When music is a mission not a competition
Now I hear you dissin' frontin' and bitchin'
About: he probably wack can't make a partytrack
Fuck that I pump the beat till the beast get a heartattack
A part of rap like battlin' and all of that
But before I kill emcees I kill the police
I'm really for peace love and equality
But it seems the police love to follow me
Because I' m hiphop I never felt the pressure from the hype
Not the type to give a fuck  spit it in the mike!
'Cause I never aspired to be the best of all
Only here to inspire the rest of y'all
to stand tall Get up stand up for your rights
My people know what I mean Yeah sure you're right!

Stay away from all irrelevant things like:
Who got the most dough? Who got the best flow?
Who gives a fuck when it's our turn to go? Get ready!

Who cares if you're a millionaire rap star or bum?
What's that car gonna do when you lost your girl?

What good is cream when happiness never come to stay?
When shit just don't seem to go your way
Who is there tellin' you everything is gonna be okay?
While you were talking about whether this or that's true
We gave the people a voice and somebody to look up to
I don't live and die for diamonds and ends

Yeah I rap but is hip hop my life?

Looptroop,"[Promoe:]
I write with a great vengeance
Sort of like I'm innocent, facing a death sentence
Like I might not even finish my next sentence
Like all I got left to live is ten seconds
The clock's ticking, this could be my last song
My last will if you will before I pass on
I'd like to pass on some words that'd last long
And mean something even after rap's gone
Despite all the wickedness in the wilderness
And the fact that my life kinda been a mess
If I die tomorrow, I feel no bitterness
No sorrow and not one bit of stress
I'm feeling blessed that I made it this far
My 26th year, my 14th bar
I see the sunshine, feel the bass-line
Listen to it, telling us not to waste time 'cause...

[Chorus:]
[R:] If I die tomorrow
[P:] And this was my last song, I would
[R:] Feel no kind of sorrow
[P:] Nah, I would shatter no tears, but
[R:] I'd smile at my memories
[P:] Yes I, how you feel Supreme?
[R:] And pray for my enemies
[S:] Feeling good, P

[Supreme:]
Man, tough I'm sad, I had to go and all
I'm so glad I got to know you all
Don't feel bad, I hope I told you all
We had one hell of a ride so far
If I did die (Oh Lord), no need to cry (Oh Lord)
'Cause I've been around
I've been around friends who's been around since
My story begins, seen my flaws and sins
I had the women (Loved them all)
Most the bads was my fault
Hope you forgive me and remember me by our happiest memories
I tend to be afraid to give me heart away (But you was my light)
And if it's dark today, I know you'll rise and shine someway
I went away on my way up, but that's a good way to leave
Believe me when I say, ""You made it easy being me.""
[R:] (So easy-ah)
Darling you made it easy being me
Ranto, help me out
[R:] (Uuh, so easy-ah, I want to thank you)

[Chorus]

[Supreme and Promoe:]
And mom, you taught me how to see things from the bright side
That's why my brother survived, why you and dad stayed tight
Though you divorced and broke up, now I ran out of luck
But I know you grow stronger when the going gets tough
Hope I made you proud, hope you didn't worry too much
About my drinking and drugs, it never came between us
Didn't keep no secrets, I always told you about stuff
And I know you know I love you and to me that's enough
So if I die rich and famous in the hall of fame
Or in a prison nameless with a ball and chain
Sky high above the clouds and the falling rain
Making love to my woman, hear her call my name
Or banging my head against a brick wall in pain
If the last days of my life I was called insane
It's all love 'cause it's all the same
And if I'd get a new life, nothing at all I'd change

[Chorus]

[Supreme and Promoe:]
I wouldn't undo if I could... Hell, maybe I should
But it's one life to live, one love, it's all good
Think I did okay, at least enjoyed it while it lasted
Think 'bout how we laughed, shit, I'm smiling in my casket
Though I may have caused some beefs
And indeed I regret all
May have pissed off my peeps
Best believe I won't forget y'all
When I'm chilling in hip-hop heaven or spitting burners in hell
Hope you got your health and you're at peace with yourself
Became older and wiser, I hope you toast to my name
I sit beside you guys even tough my bones in the grave
I got so much more to say but this the end of the song
So just rewind the tape and don't mind singing along
Come on!

[Chorus]

[Ranto:]
If this was the last song
And these were the last days
If the show really can't go on
Then I'm catching the train (And I'll be gone)

Looptroop Rockers,"Hey yo, the cars looking blurred in my rear view mirror
When, the base so loud, it could tear through ligaments
I was bumping on pills, stressed too
Man I was digging it
Taken by surprise, when the blue lights flickering
One pulled me over, hand me over for 
Taken directly to the station
For my DNA, not no fingerprints
Not because I'm speeding, but I look so different
He must be high behind the wheels, what you figuring
I ain't saying that I'm innocent, 
Guilty of another crime
I'm denying to the bitter end
I ain't saying I'm a model citizen
Still I can't comprehend this cup that I'm pissing in
They sample my blood, they sample my urine
So those above can control what I'm doing
Down from my DNA, to my bodily fluids
So, Mister Judge, let me know if I'm pure enough

Mister Judge, let me know if I'm pure enough
Am I clean, or was it a dirty cup
Was it good, I don't know how they serve it up
But a joy, 'cause I know that you thirst for blood

Mister Judge, let me know if I'm pure enough
Am I clean, or was it a dirty cup
Was it good, I don't know how they serve it up
But a joy, 'cause I know that you thirst for blood

Like a vampire in a uniform
This evil in out the form
Forget what drugs I'm on
Forget it what would matter
To use substance of harm
But I ran away from that, yesterday
I guess it's payback time
I see those fangs for sure
Hey, mister, thanks for showing
Such an interesting little guy, feel better knowing
You looking out for me, on the look out for me
Wasn't a criminal before, but I'm about to be
My boys keep clean piss under their walls
In a little soap bottle, hidden in their drawers
But this time, I did it, and of course
I'll pay a little fine, I'll be fine 
Find out what it cost
Man, that's not the issue here
I mean that's fucked up to, but listen here

Why do you need my DNA
I'm not running away, it's probably for my good taste

Mister Judge, let me know if I'm pure enough
Am I clean, or was it a dirty cup
Was it good, I don't know how they serve it up
But a joy, 'cause I know that you thirst for blood

Mister Judge, let me know if I'm pure enough
Am I clean, or was it a dirty cup
Was it good, I don't know how they serve it up
But a joy, 'cause I know that you thirst for blood

They want to increase the birth rate
The prime minister is interested if 
I hit it on the first date
Raw, and if I shook it like an earthquake
Erupted like a volcano, perverted the third state
They want to control my bedroom
All up in my head, soon
They can alert and fly up to the dead moon
That's why the need more tax payers
They need more soldiers
In their war, 'cause the terrorist's attacking us
They need to find us an advanced technology
And a science that's based on races and mythology
So I spit with no apology
It's bigger than integrity
It's race biology
So I think twice before I plant the seed
Before I bring life into this evil fantasy
It's like an unwanted pregnancy
I feel like they don't want to 
See more people, like you and me
So, they sample my blood, they sample my urine
You never know who's next, who they are pursuing
Copyrighting DNA and your bodily fluids
You want to be god, let me know if I'm pure enough

Here my sperm, let me know if it's pure enough
Am I clean, or was it a dirty cup
Was it good, I don't know how they serve it up
But a joy, 'cause I know that you thirst for blood

Listen Judge, I don't know if I'm pure enough
Am I clean, or was it a dirty cup
Was it good, I don't know how they serve it up
But a joy, 'cause I know that you thirst for blood",Blood & Urines,2008

And when we are overcome with grief

And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be

Non-bogus brothers shake the hip and toe and just 
Get involved, roll with the souled, make the head nod 
Look at the bash slash back I kick the abstract 
Make brothers say ""Damn, that rap's fat,"" recline that ass back 
A smack-back and slap from Wild Child with the ram shack

Face the truth, my fists are guided to knock your left tooth
Lyrically, ya moms rhymes better than you and she's deaf mute
Step two times to the left, throw up ya fists
Direct 'em towards those wack MC's please as I reminisce
You might have more dollars than you have common sense

But then you change 'cause you can't be the same around the clock
You be actin' like a Amazon when the camera's on
But when the camera's off, you be actin' soft
'cause you be in that mental state, thinking that ya great
But everywhere around the gates people saying that ya fake
Like dropping out of weight while you're trying to have your cake
But ya jams ain't got no weight and many niggas won't debate
(Hey, how we do?) we keep it hot like Benihana (word)
With no drama, while you try to bite like a piranha
I'll make you wanna...

[Madlib]
...bounce, bounce when you come to see the Pack
I'mma carbonate ya flow 'cause yo' style be sounding flat
Jack A.K.A. constructor of a rhyme on a track
Conducted by Madlib invade ya face like blah
Bring it back as I rock it slow, with my lip socket lyrics,
scratch as I rock a show with simultaneous functions we create
'cause we're the sure shot
The flow got you all hypnotized but if you're not...

(Chorus)

[Wild Child]
Yo, Wild Child straight rearranging on ya drums
Ya niggas from the slums step up ya want to hum
As I take ya ass way back when blacks was like chilling
(To late for that now) Why? (Brothers mad killing)
Yo, I live in hip hop day to day because I feel it
Can't understand wack MC's out there, they try and kill it
I'll steal it, take it home, package it and seal it
Bring it out on a daily basis and fry it on a skillet
Question: Will it, will it last forever?
Can't compare it to the past...never!
We're used to touch the mics, uplifting MC's on the rise
Come with the abstract and then straight up vocalize

[Madlib]
Most people now a days talk about representing
They strictly smoking Philly's, acting ill, getting bent and
The ways of the industry's mad shady tinted (yeah)
Most niggas tripping off the ill joints we invented (right)
Whether you're in L.A., Texas or Trenton
Alaska, Nebraska, Japan you have ta
Know the difference from a fake MC to a real MC
Before you play that Loot Pack CD

We're gonna ""Break dat party, rip dat party"" 

[Declaime] 
So you choose to dance with I, the rhyme wise 
Who flies by over all heads at a fast rate, from the west state 
South Cali poet, you know it to be a Madlib Invazion 
And it's gonna take a nation 
To hold me back when I attack from all angles, 
Setting out traps that entangles, strangles 
All you got chokes, can't cope with slow folks, 
Break you down like po' folks 
Mad aggression while in session, never slip or sleep 
I be Declaime when I rain down with pain 
Cool with these ways of rhyme, at the drop of a dime 
My niggas creepin' from behind, 
Here's where I draw the line, you dare cross it 
I think you lost it ya losing your mind, also your soul I control 
Got ya tranced and confused, burnt, battered, and bruised 
Simple minds get used when they snooze 

""Break dat party, rip dat party""

Hahahah... my fantasy is to line MC's in chronological order 
Tell 'em I'm mad at all of ya brothers, check out my strategy 
The time shifter as I inflict this rhyme constructor, 
You all are illusions so, peep out my mind state 
My agenda is to round you up and cause mad friction 
Take out you fiction MC's and then bring it back like treason 
I'm talking realness, everyone's speaking hip hop, but can't feel this 
I yield with my vibe 'cause I'm insured like Blue Shield 
I'm the Wild Child, I hear wack styles, time to get agile 
I'll come back with thumbtacks 'cause hip hop's mad fragile 
And then I'll cause accidents, mind state of a chameleon 
So I can come back and say Larry Parker got me one million 
Now Lootpack and Declaime represent MC's 
That'll set it off for Oxnard and my whole posse 
Wild Child with the style that'll wreck your body, 
I'm here to ""Break dat party, rip dat party"" 

[Madlib] 
Hey yo, niggas always trying to figure out what this style is 
'cause we go the extra milage 'cause your lyrics skeptic so just forget it 
It's Madlib the bad kid to bring the antiseptic 
My chemical warfare letting off hydra right beside ya 
Inside ya, it might ride ya 
Off the atlas, out this atmos, rappers becomin' like actors, the fact is 
You take a risk if you copy like a disk 
You stand alone if you tryin' to be a clone 
Rule number 4180 
It ain't only the record companies that's shady 
But they are a big part of this watered down art form 
Till Lootpack release the storm wave 
To ya commercial slaves 
I engrave my name to show you who's to blame 
For this '98 rain

Lootpack,"[Kazi] 
I'm down with all the illest  ain't no crabs all around me 
So put your head together  you still couldn't find me 
Where I be and how I live is ill 

[Madlib] 
Hey yo  niggas always talkin' bout there shit is real 
""I gotta flex with a Lex in my video"" 
That's what half of these rappers be thinking in every city, yo 

[Kazi] 
Yeah, you want to fight don't ya, you want to bite don't ya? 
The involvement of a new coast is here 
To take your soul, rearrange it with flows 
You're unknown, come across our line, you get blown 
Too many bids, ain't no puttin' together 
Restorin' your body parts, leaving the rest for whatever 

[Madlib] 
You talking bout you want to freestyle, you want to flow 
But your flow be like oil and water, it don't mix 
And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids 

[Madlib] 
Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner 
Cause we on a war path, droppin' math 'cause we only want to 
Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real 

Episode #2: God's Gift 

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass 


Episode #4: Medaphoar and Oh No 

[Chorus: Medaphoar] 
Everyday it's like a level in this game that we live 
Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed 
Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold 

[Medaphoar] 
Straight in all black on the attack be Medaphoar so freeze back 
So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La""

Never on the bandwagon at any time

For y'all niggas that be strictly braggin'
Up at the spot so eager to grab the mic with the breath of dragon
Niggas be walkin around waggin' there tail taggin'
Along trying to get their mail laggin'
Make me want to disrespect and check
Grab that nigga's neck and start gaggin'
I drop a pound of discussion and drop a rhyme to leave you with a concusion
And have your whole crew commence to hushin'
Down with the Master race of emcees
Who terrorize, whoever flies up in the face talkin' lies
I give a shout to the unseen at the lost gates
While you're makin' mistakes, we make them hot plates

Expand my lung with the chronic smoke then proceed with the plan

You out for fame talkin' about my name, I aim atcha like a gat ya
Thought you were my rapture, watch your mental fracture
You're just an actor, playin' the rap game, total shame
Nothing really gained when you shell framed is all in vain
I hitcha with that shit that make ya neck snap
While goin through my SP1200 with memory that's stacks
The beat conductor keep your speaker shakin'
I got your amp'll quakin like a vacation on Haiti
Relaxin', I'll take you on a mental trip, grip

When the first Lootpack era began a demo tape was formed
Unexpectedly, wack A&R's swarmed and started a cosmic storm
Everywhere I turned got burned thus learned I must earn
Full acknowledgement of this whole rap game on my own
Realizing I couldn't get mad at labels, labels weren't able
To see the rhythmic era Wild Child was throwing at the table
I said, Honestly, I couldn't get mad at a little blind person
Who would sleep on a Lootpack LP and ask me to define versing
I defy rehearsing, specifically I defy all those who apply cursing
To their limited freestyles they kick
When it's time to unlock those lyrical glock flows, I dip dip dive

The disadvantage of being two-faced, you can't be in two places

Like Jack Nicholson at Laker games, it's time for the Pack to enter
An atmosphere where most record labels be making clones
Preprogramming their artists so it's like it's all about making bones

Come with some unstereotype of rhymes that mad unpredicted

To break MC's in half, there rhymes be like illusion
My conclusion, Lootpack's the group that cause Likwit Fusion
Brothers mic check 1 but can't get with 2's and
I take levels of the treble, embrace the bass
And grab a hold of the steel and come face to face
Silly mortals, coming through portals yabbin' at the lip
Even if their ass was Asian, they still couldn't flip
Some old lyrical, my spiritual rhymes be physical
Kickin' metaphorical, my style's historical
It's better for a cool brother to say he saw me in an article
I hear wack rumors, but yo, it's hard to cool Wild Child down

My backbone attack wack poems, got mad rap tones
I destroy fake Madlib beats and Crackerjack poems (Ha-Ha)
It's time for lunch already, yes past lunch
I eat MC's like Captain Crunch, I attack and then punch
Rap in such different styles that's unlike yours
Wack MC's, I'll point you out and point out all of your flaws
All of your jaws get broken, styles no jokin'
Battling straight up battling is what I'm provokin'
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect thee
Hip Hop industry to the point I cannot breathe

But if Wildstyle dies before Wild Child wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake
MC's, pretty please
""'Cause when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely""

[Chorus]

Down with the Liks, Jump straight from the bass onto the kicks
Non-freestylin' MC's fall straight down in the pits
My name be Jack, spontaneous freestylist when I catch wreck
Brothers bite me so hard saying my rhymes I ain't even wrote yet
So I take it to the max, take out Fake-Funkin' Jacks
Get to the point as I rock over Madlib bumpin' tracks
""You used to get busy at open mics?"" Nah, I still do
I kill crews, lyrically, spiritually, yo I will do
Anything it takes to bring be	-boy style back
And the thanks for you to make ya say my rhyme style's phat
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect these
Hip Hop industry to the point I cannot breathe

But if Wildstyle dies before Wild Child wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake
MC's, pretty please

The long awaited  most accommodated  
Could never fade it 'cause it's always hip hop related 
Wack MC's please or you'll get annihilated 
The LP's and the Peoples called the Dilated 
Long Awaited 

[Evidence]
Freeze  this shit is outta control 
For example  an actor who never snapped out of his role 
So many try to hold me back  in the end  yo I prevail 
Watch for subliminals cause devils in the detail 
2020, no doubt will be confusing 
Catch the story of my life on VH1 Behind The Music 
(Ladies & Gentlemen), The starting line ups at home 
We got four emcees and that's five with DJ Romes 

[Rokka] 
B-boy mission in life is to add creativity to the battle scene 
Got Dilated to detonate mic weapons for mic check fiends 
Yo, Evidence (What's Up?) What's that in your hand, is it a guidance missile? 
(Yes it is) Call up ya man Rokka tell 'em it's time to blow da spot up 
With metaphors, lyrically I slap MC's up with my ten inch 
Pull rhymes right out my chest like Popeye does spinach 
Because my song must stay strong with each bomb that we deploy 
Destroy fake decoy be	-boys for those who can't avoid 

[Chorus]

[Rokka] 
Yo if my peeps' are in the trenches then I'm where the battle is 
Rokka Iriscience A.K.A. the Catalyst 
The weight of the world's on my shoulder like I'm atlas 
Dealing with the villainous tactics of the facists 
Real heads gotta rock the Lootpack shit 
Defiant Dilated, yo I'll shoot back quick 
Vocab like refugees but I call it vocap 
Spit it, ventilate 'em, leave 'em laying on their back 

[Madlib] 
It's mostly snakes handing out contracts 
Trying to see where I at 
Innovations on the Dilated, Lootpack format 
We freak the physics, break emcees on contact 
Madlib don't lack, we'll be waiting for that payback 
You better get hitting, your soul when I drop my compound on contact 
All that played out shit will have you knocked out in the first round 
cause too many frauds walking around 

[Rokka] 
If you're not making ends meet than it's not healthy 
To be representin' like the wealthy 
If you're not knowing that my name is Rokka 
Dilated platform representin' with the LP 

[Evidence] 
Yo, I take control grab the horse by the mane 
I'm that New York type of driver on this L.A. terrain 
Make it rain, when it pours we flood, cover your system 
Intuitive, straight up, avoided you by instinct 
You could take cover, dodge radar detection 
But try to dodge weeded out by natural selection 
It's finally here, the moment of the long awaited 
We represent the West, Lootpack and Dilated 

[Wild Child] 
So, better back up 'cause DJ Romes is gonna go off and 
Bringing his Technics turntable style straight out of his coffin 
I'll continue to pull out my menu of styles and bend you 
In half then laugh on behalf of my whole Lootpack staff 
Brothers be like ""I want to hear y'all ish"", at least you've waited 
First heard it hear, negative criticism is mad appreciated 
My direction takes course of a fraudulent, fake endorserer 
Thinking he's a dope rhyme style enforcerer (to the world of hip hop) 
If you don't support, you're amongst those who's gonna get dissed 
And dismissed when we come back with 10 times the force of a 

[Rokka] 
Earthquake, we laugh in Cali wild so watch the earth shake 
From the first take, pop in your box, the Long Await 
We rollin' like Juggernauts, plug in spots, 
Not talkin' bout runnin' glocks preparing for incoming stocks 
Yo it's the Pack with them Triple Optic kids 
While we keep this art real, y'all worry bout your pocket lids 

[Evidence] 
Hey yo, some are goin' Platinum, skills are still lackin' 
I meditate and coach, action like Phil Jackson 
Space invaders faded, undisputed Dilated 
Highly anticipated, Lootpack the long awaited

Lootpack,"Hah Hahahah... 
From the dungeons of darkness 
Comes God's Gift to Hip Hop 
Representin' with the LP 

We'll hit 'em hard and fast in a straight line 
Concentrating all firepower to their blindside at sunrise 
Operation sunray  UV radiation 
First breach their outer barriers then continue penetration 
To their central point  crushin' their nucleus 
Rushing their central brain command 
Planting a virus that expands 
Through your whole nervous system shutting down all communications 
To your ya bodily functions Handicapping your defenses 
Swiftly attacking your unit, Neutralizing MC's 
By ripping 'em apart before they even know what hit 'em 
Style blitz 

Jack gets pissed off, wack MC's step up and get lost 
The rhythmic boss, Jack spits rhymes through my teeth like floss 
I bust with motivation to uplift MC's with 
High above controlling stratus clouds, my man God's Gift 
Come down, assist us, wack MC's must be reminded 
Get a Lootpack tape, rewind it, for those closed minded 
To the abstract we kick, we rock all places 
I found out MC's aren't human 'cause they got two faces 
They be chillin', willin', always time killin' 
Wack rumor spillin' while Jack be still in charge 
Asking me if I smoke chronic, niggas it's ironic 
I'm Wild Child, 80% human, 20% bionic 
My main occupation is to step up and rock the nation 
Focus up upon my jam and blow up just like inflation 
So if you ain't down, don't front, worry about your health 
Worry about your wack crew and ya wack ass self 

Ay yo, here comes the Master Don, here to renovate 
My style hits ya like marble weights so pass the dinner plate 
But pass up the swine like money ya rhyme lime 
Madlib done told ya time and time again 
Find the mental maze, faster ya plaster your instrumental 
With lyrical disaster till you scream out ""Who's the master?"" 
I flip it up rip it up to raw addict, 
Crate diggin' for the static when I mad beat shop 
Impulse down to prestige and Black Jazz 
21st Century enja got mad 
Record labels of the old, ill loop and take 'em out 
I keep it secret when a nigga tries to peep shit 
My beat hit like a Roy Jones Jr. skit 
Your girl starin so now you want to flip 
I rip it down to the Loot while ya yell peace 
While I pull out my piece, yell peace but now leave ya in pieces 
But at least you escaped this beast 
Smokin' on a cushin' leaf while ya try to bring grief 

Now something's shaking in the palace, can't you feel the Santa Ana 
Switching currents and building velocity, it got's to be 
God's Gift and Lootpack, mentally superior master race of lyricists 
Conductiong verbal experiments 
With open and imaginitive creativity 
Fathering styles from infancy to be lyrically 
Complete, grown and fully developed adults 
Trained in mastering total blitz coastal, total assaults 
Also we launch all out war when we tour your area 
First destroying your local underground spots 
Rocked your major clubs and plugged into your theatres 
Advancing as hip hop's vocabulary leaders 
Hostile take-overs is our main focus 
As the deadliest of CDP special attack forces 
Basically, MC's lack division is appalling 
Third rate styles with the nerve to say they're vocalists 
Out of focus, often it's the people they run with 
Coupled with their own wackness, they're futureless!

No sé que aventuras correré sin ti

En un viejo Cadillac segunda mano

A mis pies mi ciudad
Y hare un momento que me ha dejado
Aquí en la ladera del Tibidabo
La última rubia con quien iba a probar
El asiento de atrás
Quizás el Martini me ha hecho recordar
Nena, porqué no volviste a llamar
Creí que podía olvidarte sin más
Y aún a ratos ya ves
Y al irse la rubia me he sentido extraño
Me he quedado solo fumando un cigarro
Me ha sentenciado, nostalgia de ti
Y desde esta curva donde estoy parado
Me he sorprendido mirando a tu barrio
Me han atrapado luces de ciudad
El amanecer me sorprenderá
Dormido, borracho, en el Cadillac

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well we're doin' mighty fine I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believen' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believen' that we all were on their side

When she was nine years old
She had a little trouble
Doing what she was told
Strong-willed, spirit-filled, innocent, wild
Not your typical yes ma'am, no ma'am child
It was her life and she was gonna live it
And if it took her heart and soul
She was gonna give it

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge

That's just how she is
That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

She instinctively knew
Love is the teacher
Life is the school
And she figured it out one fateful day
That if she played it safe she would never play
And in that moment hearts dream about
A girl walked in and a woman walked out

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge

Lord Belial,"In the beginning of all time, when I was born
A shadow crawled all over me
The shadow, shadow of the northern son
Which filled me with darkness and majestic hatred
Join the darkness of the northern son 
Belial
I stared onto the dark prince of evil, 
Enwrapped in a black gown a great malignant shape
With a dark voice as cold as ice
My blood froze when I stared onto this prince of evil 
Belial
Nowadays, thousands of years later I have become one with the darkness in
This mighty kingdom, 
I obey Belial
He is the lord over all living creatures He shall rule for eternity 
He is the master of masters

Once again... the voice calls for me to come for my reward - another kingdom
to rule.
Once again... I´ll create a new world and enslave the souls of my enemies as
I’ve done since the birth of time.

Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'ma inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Fuck, shit up on the hurry up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowin' niggaz back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill

Hit you with the blast

If I had the whole world
I would give it away

Lord Finesse,"Chorus:
(Mad brothers know his name) (Yeah, it's him again)  Repeat 4x

Lord Finesse got something for your eardrums
Back on the scene, long time, no hear from
It's the funky man, the brother with the same sound
I've been coolin about a year and some change now
So hand over the microphone cause it's my turn
The brother with a fade, half-moon, and long sideburns
Nice, dope, and keep the girls scoping
Say the funky shit and get all the niggas open
So heed that, don't try to yap and give me feedback
I'll get in that ass, believe that
Can it, I'll steal your show like a bandit
I get papes while you're broke like mass transit
You're not as smooth as this, so what can you do with this
Brothers need to stop and step with that foolishness
I'm the type to interrupt a party
I don't need a phone to reach out and touch somebody
Gimme a mic, it's just as good as one
Leave the party is what you wack MC's should of done
Cause y'all starving, I'm living extra large and
I'm swinging shit as if my name was Tarzan
Yeah, cause I'm on some old new shit
Got more styles than you see in a Kung Fu flick
Mic the seas, wax opponents off with ease
I'm more deadly than a venerial disease
So think twice, those who think Imma fall
I'm shining more than a tire full of Armor All
It's Lord Finesse and I got shit planned
Hot damn, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Chorus

Brothers get cash, but I get way more
In the 90's, I'm getting paid for
Rhyme and envy, 21st century
When asked, ""Who's the funkiest?"" You better mention me
I go all out while a lot of crews be fronting
I know and they know that they can't do me nothing
Cause I'm smooth and wise, the skills I utilize
Lyrics all advanced you'd think my brain was computerized
So who needs a partner or a sidekick?
When it comes to being funky, I got all that old fly shit
The rough and rugged, plus the pimp smooth rhyme
I polish opponents off like a shoe shine
They be fronting like they on the crazy tip
Trying to hang but they softer than baby shit
Fronting like they wild with they bullshit style
I'll put they ass on trial, pull they card and they file
I'm hardcore, but I still keep the scene pumping
So all that singing and dancing, that shit don't mean nothing
MC's suffer Lord Finnese lately
Some of them hate me, think that they can take me
I'll take on some of them, bring a whole ton of them
I'll take em all on and stomp each and every one of them
I just chill, relax and flaunt my cash
You want to riff, I'll be quit to stomp that ass
And let you know that you can't get with this
Come one come all and get burnt by the quickness
Greater, creator, drop stupid data
If I ever got served it had to be by a waiter
I lounge in the rest until my song is done
I plan to be straight with papes in the long run
Cause when it comes to rhymes I give you more than you ask for
Bring a whole task force, I rhyme my fucking ass off
I stand in command with the mic in my hand
Aw shit, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Chorus

Stand back, I'm about to flip here
Got dissed last year so I kick ass this year
Brothers were stressing me, strictly overworking me
(They showed you last year)  Yeah, that fits perfectly
Cool, cause I'm still kinda fed with them
Who gives a fuck, I'm about 20 steps ahead of them
Now I'm established, they feel all embarrassed
Cause I'm with Warner Brothers and my man Gary Harris
Spread the news or should I say buzz?
(Finesse is paid!) Thought I wasn't when I was
The last label was confusing me, jerking me, fooling me
Now that I'm paid, you know what y'all can do for me
Since I sound funky a lot of labels want me
But I'll be damned to be another man's flunky
I can never be a stool pidgeon, I'd rather be a full pidgeon
Fuck the bullshitting
Cause in the 90's I got more than a little game
I'm Lord Finesse and funky is my middle name
Plus my title and everyone wants mine
It's the brother with the compounds and punchlines
I can still put my foot all in your ass
I'm smooth and funky plus smoother than Teddy Pendergrass
It's the man to put words in a simile
(He's a funky technician) Yeah, y'all remember me
I'm real and actual, the man out taxing you
I got rhymes and Mike got a scratch or two
So ain't no use trying to eat us for din-din
Brothers better off trying their luck with Win-Ten
To the opposition: I'm the man out burning ya
I dust a rapper off like furnature
So take our stand, I foil your plan
Goddamn, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Chorus",Return of the Funky Man,1991
Lord Finesse,"Check it out, for those that know me
Ya wonder why I always play low key
I know I got people and fans that like me
But all the noise and attention don't excite me

So I just lounge and play the D.L
In the crib with just me and a female
I'm still slick besides the others
'Cause a player like me

Yo, I'm smoother than the Isley Brothers
When I'm on the scene I get feedback
Brothers runnin' up, wassup, where you be at?
I be by myself just coolin'

'Cause I don't have time to sweat what someone else is doin'
'Cause their not equal to me

What'cha gonna do

Hey yo, that ain't nothin' new
But my fame is stressin' others

So you always got some that always want to test a brother
But I'm wildin' at home kid
I'm straight makin' papes, so tell me what ya problem is
Ya talk about unity, but when I turn my back

You talkin' about what ya want to do to me
Yeah, you could keep riffin'
I ain't the one, I sent ya home with ya teeth missin'

I'm out to get dough
Makin brothers petro
Some suckas don't like me
But I could care less though
Cause I'm a command why'all
I'm smackin' brothers up like Puerto Ricans play handball
But I ain't the funny type that joke around, huh
I gotta get my money right
And I got the right game
I'm definetely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin head cracks, trips
And makin all the brothers mad at me
They might as well give up
The way I'm takin all the dough, this might as well be a stick up
Cause it's a mans thing
The way I got things sold
Yo, they can't do a damn thing
Tryin to gain props
I ain't the one to see
Ya clowns mess around and get played like a drum machine
You gotta find a better way
I'm pullin everything from your car to your resume
Cause I don't play clown
I'm tryin to get mine 
That's why my face stay frown
I don't smile or try to play my foul
I light your boys like ?tile?
Hey yo, you know my style
So just slow down, cause why'all can't throw down
And why'all can't accept that a brothers makin dough now
And I'm livin better, true
I makin more noise than the loudest heavy metal group
It's the cool man, brother with the smooth plan
That's why I'm seeing more papers than a newstand
So peep it, don't try to run and speak it
Point blank that keep my way about secret
While brothers is packin still, actin ill
I'm on the D.L, with a female
And I'm stackin bills
How ya livin?  Yeah I'm livin swell

Gettin' men lynched, too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well

Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step

Come on, I know you like it
Don't font on me, I read your whole card like a psychic
(Yeah, you got clout) No doubt, plus I'm getting money
Ain't a brother out teaching when I'm kicking, honey

[ VERSE 1: Lord Finesse ]
I'm real like the Son Of Sam while other are soft like Richie Gun-In-Hand
Their styles is outdated like the _Running Man_
A tough vet, I'm the roughneck that drops logic
The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks
I got thumpin raps that'll have you niggas doin jumpin jacks
I come with the fat songs, put me on any platform
Watch me get my muthafuckin rap on
A top cat that rocks rap
>From the part of Boogie Down Bronx where the cabs don't stop at
The Asiatic rap fanatic that don't have it
My style's tighter than a virgin locked in traffic
You get ripped like a cardboard
Because you watch gangsta flicks, you write rhymes, don't mean you're hardcore
I'm so devine when I flow and rhyme
I blow your mind when I go for mine

Be on some hip-hop shit, cause the music like hypnotic
I can't stop it, oh Lord, so I just drops it
Till the slayings leave abrasions, hot like cajun
Trails be blazin behind this chinky-eyed non-Asian
Female bringin it to ya like e-mail
With advanced techniques off these New York streets

Strong as a bull, while you be slackin like a 76er

Now, you say Grenada, and I say Grenada
Big up to Greeny Greeen, I meet your black ass later
But wait a, minute, cause I'm in it to win it
With the freestyle flow I steal the show like John Benett
But then it, really wouldn't matter to a nigga
You figure you have to sneak up cause I'm bigger
Yo jigga, take down the beat just a little
Far from brittle, chew a nigga like a skittle
But it'll, be a cold day in the Caribean
At the Meridian, I swim through girls like an amphibian
I'm witty and, versed with the lyrical blessin
Never fessin, and keep the chickens second-guessin
Known for stressin engineers in my session
I flake in one take, and slide like Wesson
So learn a lesson, I make the episode brief

Try to spark this, you'll get torn, cause you never win
I'm through, I'll take you, through hell again

Stay legit cause we're veterans
Proceed what I don't achieve
Leave up to my seed, teach him that he gotta bleed
Don't fall victim to greed
That you give is what you're blessed with
Find it, put it to use, have faith and don't stress shit
Meanwhile I hit the ganja, now watch it kiss my lips
Bless it, then pass it, like Magic's top 10 assists
It's the cheeba-cheeba, another neighborhood news feature
Who can see the, Giant? Not a known creature
Or being alive that can see me on this rap vibe
High off of hip-hop, can't die, I got cat lives
Abuse this, get smuddered is how you'll be discovered
Give me 20 years in here with no dough, I still love it
It's in my heart, when I bled, it was red
Won't stop till I drop dead, or catch some led to my head
Some search for bread, loot, cheese, or whatever

On the block all alone and put the glock to his dome
Tell him ""Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split""
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me

A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky

But yo, I am not one to down another

Because 100% is what I give it (Say what?)

I tear it, repair it

Save all your crocodile tears, grin and bear it
And with all your other brothers you're gonna share it
You hear me, junior? Cause soon you'll
Be a grown man with the mic in your hand

Lord Flea,"Long time ago in Trinidad
Happen such a thing to make you sad
Had a big fire where they make the rum
For miles around all the people come
And they shouting

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

A little old woman past eighty eight
Running in the fire thru the burning gate
Before you could beat on a funeral drum
She was rollin' out a peck o' rum
And she singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

The way de woman runnin' into the flame
Man you would think was a Carnival game
I Tell you friends it was a sight to see
I never had known such bravery
And she screaming

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

The way de woman runnin' with a bucket and line
Man she was working overtime
She work up her sweat and never complain
She was drinking rum and prayin' for rain
And she singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

You could see the fire way down the road
Everybody waited for the thing to explode
The distillery burnt down to the ground
Not a single drop of rum could be found
And they singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

Although it all happened a long time ago
There is one thing that I don't know
She was eighty eight there is no doubt
How she get all the rum in she mouth
And she singing

Out the fire down there
Out the fire down there

Lord Have Mercy,"Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife


Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

My twenty block radius, think we need some barb wire fences
Stop bitch niggas, like you from easily trespassing
Nickel-nine, shine on your eye, then you see fire blastin'
Get off my premises, aye yo, Lord, is you a friend of his?
Mouth him back to John and show this nigga, just who the winner is
The presence of a small town, I diminish and blemishes

When chickens twist trees and dick tease

School your army, ya squad weak
Remove four camps when I say
Pumpin arms like nor plants

Home sweet home down with monster control
Still they in the cut like Ron and Nicole
And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Blind feelin nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
Con scrimmage, woke up Allah's children
Dirty-ass Vietnam village

Drown violators in buckets of piss water

A tattoo of pyramids, puttin hollows in clips
Peeped your gat, jammed tight, Ross your lookin to riff (what the fuck?)
QB's type shit, cause we runnin your clique
See me in the drop, with your six, sayin she snitched
But never that, 'cause-o, high beam through the window 
My lookouts move slow, they heard you never blast though
Got a safe in your crib, sham, you know the code
Search, spoke out, 3, 2, 1, that's zero
Took the see notes and flip mode left on the quietest note
Swallowed these then cleared your throat
Bitch ass, you should have spoke

Closed coffin with flags folded in half
Triangular shape, blow out the candles with grace
For fabulous tastes, some will, battle for space
Pay the ultimate price, poltergeist
Put the holy ghost in your life, bring you closer to Christ
Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight
Resculpture the mic, then smash heads like the opium bite
Prophet in vein, Metropolis claim body and soul
ID's controlled in the optical frame

Staking  whole lot of money get me before I finish my rap

Never head wobble with fool 
Tomorrow was cruel to flock on the moon 
La La bye messaging your crew
Travel at high speeds

God on the move
Pardon me duke
Nationwide thick base collide 
The gritty groove, smash fifty-two 
And levitate your side
Who want it? 
Your back weak running like athletes
Get on it

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor

Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.

Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.

Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.

Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.

Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.

You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us

Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme

Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon

Lord High Fixers,"I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)

Lord Huron,"How long have I known you, brother
Hundreds of lives, thousands of years
How many miles have we wandered
Under the sky, chasing our fear

Some kind of trouble is coming
Don't know when, don't know what
I will stand by you, brother
'Til the daylight comes or I'm dead and gone

I've shared my life with you, brother
Since I recall, you've been my friend
You say we're not like the others
Still we must die, all things must end

I know we can't stop what's coming
But I will try, oh how I'll try!
Will you fight with me, brother
One last time, one last fight

Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same

I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted

Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm-a wanderin'
Not while we're both still alive

There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me

I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me

Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' a life you've been given

Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore

Where the great waves break
And the night runs right into the day
I wanna be with the ones I left
But I'm way out west
And the years keep on slipping away
I wanna run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins
Where the fires of my ancestors burned
I remember that fateful day
When I ran away
And you told me I couldn't return

You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again
I will be back one day, and I'll find you
There by the great big lake

Trying to flee that life
But I can't seem to leave it behind
Wanna visit the windswept shores
Of a time before
When the moon and the stars were aligned
I remember the bright spring day
When you sparked that flame
And a fire that continues to burn
I remember the day I left
Headin' way out west
When you told me to never return

You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again

You've been in the wind, you've been on my mind
You are the purest soul I've ever known in my life

Take your time, let the rivers guide you in
You know where you can find me again
I'll be waiting here 'til the stars fall out of the sky

When you left I was far too young
To know you're worth more than the moon and the sun
You are still alive when I look to the sky in the night

I would wait for a thousand years
I would sit right here by the lake, my dear
You just let me know that you're coming home
And I'll wait for you

Years have gone but the pain is the same
I have passed my days by the sound of your name
Well they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby?

Death is a wall but it can't be the end
You are my protector and my best friend
Well they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby?
How do they know? Well, they don't",In the Wind,2012
Lord Huron,"Minor changes and grammar I land on an island coast
Where the only souls I see are ghosts
I run through a wooded isle
And I chase the sunlight mile after mile
And I feel like I know this place
As the tree line breaks into wide-open space
I stare at a bright red sun
Though I search all day, I never find anyone

I walk on a winding road
In the deep of the night, near the edge of the known
I pass by a moonlit lake
And a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake
And I feel I should know this place
As the road winds on into wide-open space
The wind plays a haunting tone
As I make my way through the night all alone

I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
And a road that don't never end
I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
What am I destined to be? It's a mystery baby
Just please don't leave me alone

I lie under starlit sky
And the seasons change in the blink of an eye
I watch as the planets turn
And the old stars die and the young stars burn
But I don't really know this place,
And it's lonesome here in the wide-open space
Can it be as real as it seems?
Maybe this time I won't wake from the dream",Lonesome Dreams,2012
Lord Huron,"You arrive along with the sun
Where have you been darlin'? What have you done?
You were out finding trouble again
There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands

Come inside and lie down to sleep
You ain't gonna run and you know that you're beat
Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do

Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever

I was heading back out west
Trying to keep my eyes open wide
I'd gone days without any rest
Saw him lying in the road looking bad about 20 yards ahead
You come back from a trip to the east
But you don't come back from the dead

Sure as hell he was dead as they come
And he was already starting to smell
Just a kid with his hair slicked back
And a knife tucked into his belt
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life
That never felt like his?
Though I was was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
And lay his soul to rest out in the desert night

I laid him down in a grave in the sand
And he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand
He said: ""I know I'm dead but I don't wanna lie
In a grave out here where the coyote's cry

I stared right into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
And there ain't no thrills in the afterlife

So lift me up out of here my friend
And I'll wander the night 'til the ages end.""

Way up north to have taught you to stand
Before I commence my ride

But he ain't gonna delay my plans

I know she's gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love I'm gonna live my life with her
You know I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him cause I'm a fool for love

I've come far to find Big Jim
Well here I am and I guess you him
I see how you got your name
You're tall as hell and broad as a train
They say you a hard-broiled man
And the baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well I'm not afraid to fight
Let's step outside and I'll show you why

I'm humming like a revved up truck
Never mind the odds I'm gonna try my luck with her
Just tell me when you've had enough
I'm dangerous cause I'm a fool for love

You know you don't hit half bad
For my love I will lay in the grave tonight
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you off to an early death

I lie in the drifting snow
Bleeding out as it covers me up
If Spring comes before I'm found
Just throw my bones in a hole in the ground

I lost friends along my way
I knew I'd need them eventually
No I'm not afraid to die
Just mad I left Big Jim alive

I know I should've never looked back
But you ain't gonna win a woman's heart like that
I never should've called his bluff
I was born to lose cause I'm a fool for love

I stare into the endless sky
And I saw a tale of my life go by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don't know where I'm going

Lord Huron,"Deep into the night
With the moonlight as my guide
I will wander through the pines and make my way to nature's shrines

And I look up to the sky
And I know you're still alive
But I wonder where you are, I call your name into the dark

I wake up in the morning, oh, and I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside and huddled in the wind

And it feels like I've been away for an era, but nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you but, oh, what did you you do and where have you gone?

On the night you disappeared
Oh, if I had seen you clear
But the strange light in the sky was shining right into my eyes

There was no one else in sight
Just the endless frozen pines
But I wonder how they know, cause they don't die if they don't grow

I am ready to follow you even though I don't know where
I've been waiting the night until you decide to take me there

Cause I know I don't wanna stay here forever it's gotta be moving on
Oh, I don't wanna be the only one living if all of my friends are gone

I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through, there's another light beyond the lie

Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick outta thunder and lightning and
Tearing through the night hollering your name

I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I drive fast and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight

I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreaming and you wake up dead
It's a long night can I spend it with you
Cause you're oh so pretty when you stand on the edge

Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

Oh little darlin' don't you like falling down
Through the sky like a diving plane
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

What is life? Only visions
When I die, I'm coming right on back for you
Who am I? An illusion
Would I lie? I'm coming right on back for you

Then you came into my life with come hither in your eyes

Turn him into the walking dead

I hear the river say your name
I have only ’til the night is over",When the Night is Over,2018
Lord Huron,"I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you

Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river

I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees

If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life

Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again

And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher

If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river",Wait by the River,2018
Lord Infamous,"[Chorus]
If you had a choice of colors 
which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which one you perfer to be right

[Verse 1]
Another day means another way
I can get some pay guys are gray
but the turning blue for a player true
to the game all aboard the train
those who kept it real couldn't hang I'm a holler man
this one you feel well I feel choices I made
ways to get paid if I lay down on my back
then I won't get jacked Project Pat
never fake the deal all about a meal 
keep a strap for the wolf pack out here trying to steal
cause I still think some of y'all 
want to see my fall but I ball that's in any weather 
can we stick together all is one but I know its some
always want to preach that I'm wrong 
cause I rap a song lyrically I reach
to the youth and I'm getting paid and I'm out the slum
legally ghetto fabulous player give me some
count my props cause I never stop trying to get laid
feeling good stacking dollar bills choices I made

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Here I go with a steady flow finally it last
on the bricks not behind bars come back in the past
had no cash and I had no car so i had to do anything 
just to maintain sipping on the brew not a fool
keeping hazards down to a minimum staying cool
down with my hood Memphis Hollywood understood
everybody can't play the same role
make a choice do it legally or you slang dope
but I hope that the choice made is the one for you
have a clue gotta know yourself 
hustle to your death making wealth
with a pad and pen walking out the pin
making steps to be right on top of my game again
 see my friend you the master of your destiny it can be
what you want it to man it's all on you player who
want to blow a dub ease on the brain
ain't no pain just a lot of love curving through your vain

So yo check this out
This is Ice Cube from the Westside Connection
Callin all the way from Johannesburg, South Africa
The world has never seen a million black men in one place
But on October 16, in Washington, D.C., a million black men will gather

""This is a mission, not a small time thing"" (sample repeats)
[Mobb Deep]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, word up son, check it out though
YaknowhatI'msayin? Word up son
Listen up son, knowhatI'msayin?
(Watch out for them man) Listen up son, check it out though, yo

Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Windows 95 updated high tech lynchin
Crosses of the colored man who claims he holds the keys to the safe
Secrets of the world, blow him in his face
Who's the master of the universe, galaxy and planets
Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in two thousand)

[Ice-T]
Brothers gonna have to put themself in check
Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck
Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone
You tell me brothers got no options today
You best to listen to the Ice closely fool, crime don't pay
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent

[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene knahmean
But I've been knockin em out the box like ??
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

[Chorus: all together]
So where you at why'all?
Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at why'all?
Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air

[Smooth B]
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
My people with braids waves dreads and baldheads
A million strong doin duty, wisdom strength beauty
Ummah Ahs they are, sun moon star
And it's a holy day, come sober
Smooth be	 in D.C., sixteenth of October
In unity there is power, none can devour
Hour after hour, we shower

[RZA & Killah Priest]
Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth
Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

[Chorus]

[DA Smart]
Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

[KAM]
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause why'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
The homies say that they rollin
Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin

Up north to the down south 
Live wires connect 
So if you swangin' on thangs 
(Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar) 
Or down to gangbang, or waitin' on the train 
It's still the same thang 

You cut your mind and your body with the rhyme and the shotty 
Go and find me or hidin', with wine and Bacardi 
Get down like John Gotti then I gotta get lost 
I'm gone in the wind 
My momma keep on tellin' me there's Bun in the sin 
I guess I'm hell-bound destined 
To learn my lesson, sess in my chestin' 
It burn but I keep on puffin, no bluffin' 
They don't call me Big Bun for nothin' 
No homeboys you come dead, well put em to rest 
Bumba clocks em all dead, wit two in his chest 
Botty bwoy you come dead, and if in all die 
Will you run dead em again? Well go on buddy let em fly 
That's how it is in my city, and your city 
Sir it gets no prettier just more gritty per capita, all around 
From the five boroughs on down to the mighty Bro town

Now watch this current rock it current for a sentence 
For a triple homicide, cripple any drama that reside in the mind 
Of those livin' outside of my state line 
Let em know we all the same kind 
With the same crimes, catchin' the same time, which translates to hang time 
Organized gangs slangin' dime 
Lord Jamar is black G-zuz, I sees this 
Everywhere I go, brothers hustlin' to make the doe 
Fast or slow, ya want to see your cash grow 
Like grass, but meanwhile take a blast of the el 
And let the smell resonate, never hesitate 
When it comes to puttin' food on your plate 
Devise schemes by all means 
Like a sunrise when it beams, keep your eyes on the cream 
Live wires on the team Connect, get respect for they realness 
I know you feel this 

[Chorus]

Uhh, now who that tryin ta claim they be thumpin' 
That's only when your funky little fake tape be bumpin' 
You can catch a square and get done unfair 
Because aah, I'll be there, I'll be right there 
Cocoa butter, got that, make em all for 
Real life hustler movie maker, I know how y'all feel 
But long as I'm alive I'ma do the right thing 
And block out this stress my past criminal life might bring 
The only way I use to nip it in the bud 
Was ta try and put some bullets in some of you joker's guts 
I got victims, G it ain't about the face you make 
It's all about the place you take between yourself and snakes 
Now everybody open up your arms for the cocoa- 
Mr.Former Football Player-ex drug dealer-gold digger-
Killer with scrilla, they be missin' me with the bomb breakin' 
'Cause I gets busy like no cornwheat 

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' ta stack paper, these pigs can't stand me 
It's all about my family, it's all about my candy 
It's all about the crush, all about the feelin' good 
All about the rush, all about us, the first family 
Somethin' that a young fool never really planned to be 
But funny situations, do bring change 
And young fools do out here in this wicked game 
That's how I'm gon' starve when fools eatin' steak 
Man, I can't stop now, too much money out here to make 
Now you could turn your nose up and you can suck your teeth 
But I gotta get this money, ain't nobody gonna get it for me 
And I might have to do shady things 
Stick up kid all out, no shame 
Run your rings, ear ring in change 
Don't make me give it to ya 'cause it ain't no thang 
I do it for the glory man, cuff the thangs 
I gotta let em hang, I'm stuck in '87 tryin' to regain my brain 
Too many undercovers know my name 
A phone line like fire 'cause I'm a live wire

Who is this with malicious onslaughts?

And we bustin' on all you losers 
Ridin' twenty-deep in two black Land Cruisers 
Recognize or get paralyzed with the drum 
Where I'm from they promise you a fair one, then blast you with the gun 
And everybody standin' around like it's funny 
Junior L.O.D pickin' your pockets for your money 
The checkered, I slide off and make a funky record about it 
No more than four minutes and some seconds 
And live wire connected, from my peoples on the street who respect it 
And the jeeps, hoopties, Benz and Lexus 
My squad stretches from New York to Portland to Texas 
Let's see who's next to test this 
Some herbs, ready to get their heads served 
To the hard curb

For my case on appeals, it took over a year
In that time, a nigga didn't see nor hear
Got to the point, there was no respect at all
I was shocked when you did not collect my call
Spent nights in my cell just beatin' my dick
Thinkin' bout, how we used to fuck and shit
I took you out, bought cha' ass a bunch of shit
When I get out
I'm gonna fuckin' punch this bitch right in her mouth

As I do it like that, do it like this
Shorty watch your step or you might get Rocked like Chris
Are you feelin this? You dig the way it's going down?
Now we back in town watch all the chickens crowd around
Niggas try to duplicate my flow but it's difficult
Like a game of Yahtzee
Chickens stress me out like paparazzi
As I flip a flow you desire
Dattie blaze those trees and let's start this forest fire
My rhymes carry like the weight on Barry
Stack cheddar like Combs and buy homes like Larry
I be smoother than Tal, Sharp-ton like Al
When you ballin everybody want to be your pal
No dilly-dally, baggin up the shorter alley
Bouncin in German cars, still playin shot-ball
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you
For sure dog cause this is how we do

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Sadat X]
Ah , I see men mitts (?)
Watch the green van cause inside's the dicks
The prayer beads bleeds from the crucifix
Went tight comin out boy I be down in six
Or when the sun go down, or when it's round in the BX
(?)
Cats on the concourse, still holdin dx (?)
Bums on the street often ask me for change
What's change when I'm tryin to save up for the Range?
I want the whole world and my old back
Change that -- I want half the world, and my old 
You can play the hell out, like those that came before ya
Your style is butt, similar to a cobra
That's your pimp strut
But what you foes is really doin
Is leaving your empire in ruins
I'm the problem solver
I got the brand new revolver
But I got a new album too
I want to be here for that money and the rest of my crew
Y'all know it's true-- a nigga like me is due

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Puba]
Now you know I gots to come back strong
See I been doing this too goddamned long
For me to ever try to come back wrong
Check my pockets and my empty light just came on
Don't wanna do wrong so I think I'm best to make this song
Undeniably satisfiably master microphone mutilator
None greater, ain't no Automator
Grand Puba and Dattie, riding shotty in the Mazarati
As we come and blaze you with this body

[Sadat]
Corner poets get smacked and hit, savagely bit
I go git and then you out of it, permission to quit
I mean right, I keep the green light specials
Half price a slice, you blink twice
I done picked up the dice
I'm that nice, Dattie X the party-starter
Number one heart-ripper-aparter
More vice and than Las Vegas, Nevada
I try harder every day
It's all work and no play

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio

Up Against The Wall they caught me 'cause you can cp
And you ain't suppose to die of natural death, that's that
Got the world carved on mines, fuck who's underslines
Watchin' all these niggas in the street for a while
Break it down more than motherfuckin' third port south
I keep it real ou keep it to yourself and don't say jack
Every time I turn around and you're all in my back
For what? I don't know
These others won't leave me alone
I've been here for 20 years 
I'm here to stand my ground
And these devils gettin' open but they can't get down
Checkin' lyrics to the city like a newport see's
These types of lyric that's mine that's organized with the time
I'm on the road checkin' my V.I.
I just wanted cut
But the seasons enough to touch got 'em all fucked up
What you want right now you many see mad later
Yo my word is devine you got to seek and find
And took place to rest my mind ono petyy crimes
Yo I'm up against the wall

Yo the world is falling
Death is calling
I don't know MC's be brawling
On the mike, when I get hyped
Whenever you want yo whatever you like
bite on my style, I like that
Yo here is your feedback with one smack
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
No time to be playing 'cause these niggas be delaying
Word yo when I get busy
Here and over there to New York City
One for one, one for all
I'm on the wall my back is on the wall

Yo is a wonderful world, a world of wonder
I thunder and thunder I won't go under
Won't get in the trap I'm passed all that
You stupid mothefucka my rhyme is phat
Phat as can be on the M-I-see
In the place to be, if you can see
You don't know then go ask your momma

One of one, one for all

That's what I see in these stree rockin' rugged and hard
In this end five standers is gettin' pop this car
Niggas not keeping it real and they will get par
5-O form my back thinkin' that they're in guard
Brothers keep on deviding and we won't get far
The devil's on some slick shit ready to hold us down
But I maintain my focus and just hold the fort down
You all know a situation funny thing like this
Unsuspicious yellow cb riding through the East
Stereo-type brother make the undercovers wonder
Got lawyers all in the East ready to shine my light
Nutcracker get 'em pen for his spark the night
for my brothers and my sisters in the streets dong their thing

Had my back against the wall

There were times life felt so easy, I make it harder on myself
Sabotaged the pursuit of rap wealth, cause cash is dumb whack
I dug myself a hole, just to make a come back
Was writing daily 'til that honey dripper's drum cracked
To the point that when I came out, they thought I was someone else
Ain't planned it like that, but it helps
Remember recoding every week, just to get my tops up
And fools acting like I just popped out (what)
Before I ever made a project, I would go to projects out there getting busy
The fuck was suckas talking 'bout ""who is he""
Son they been tryna tell you but you didn't listen, walking contradictions
I made it pop without y'all, I was on a mission
Now herbs come around acting like they made us
They in a state of envy like Vegas, Nevada

Every day a different city I be flying through
This stress gives you gray hairs, I just found a few
Found me a little bad bitch and she 'bout it too
Grinding hard, making sure this bank account is full
Had my back against the wall, fought my way through
Watched a couple cats profit off my wave too
Still running with the same crew, cause I stay true
Term and Statik established 1982
This must be heaven, being a dad plus a legend
I got a seven figure dream, that's a lucky seven
I hit the dutch, exhale, then sip this cup
Tryna take away the pain so I'm liquored up
Listen up, every day you wake is a blessing
That's another twenty-four to grind for this cheddar

Back against the wall
Uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh

My life was a mess, I guess that's when I perform best

Had the back against the wall, oh
Yeah, I got my back, I got my back against the wall)",Wall Flowers,2015

Woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
There was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He met a young girl who suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said, ""Son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
And soon another girl on the island, he found
He went to his papa to name the day
His papa shook his head and this time he did say

""You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
That girl is your aunty but your granny don't know

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Now, he went to his mama and covered his head
He told his mama what his papa had said
His mama, she laughed, she said, ""Go man, go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know""

I represent the real hip-hop, I ain't no freakin' country bumpkin 
Hooparistic, freakaristic, poetic frenzy with conception 
I got more flavor than a mystic 
Fringe benefitic, urging y'all to get wit it 
Style postulates, now pause while you gets splitted 
I'm not just taco, I'm the whole enchilado

Together we provide a ton of better on the way and 
We rhyme related 
Very under-estimated, that's why I'm winnin' 
In this world of sins, steady grinning, money boss spendin' 
Distanced from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influential 
Spiritually and mental, what you into I'd a been through 
Preachin' my words and don't know it, you owe it 
It shows you want to be me but won't show it 
Ain't nothin' changed but the playas 
The game remains the same 
I had a ten year run, hey, I can't complain 
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi 
From the B.X., we ridin' to South Beach on jet ski 
Play to survive, you ain't live, you just livin' 
You breathin' a good one, but where I'm from y'all forbidden 
Come around, bad decision, you'd rather be in prison 
Ain't no duckin' when I'm delivering, won't be forgiver-in' 
Layin' there shiverin, half the night 
You gotta walk towards the light, everything is aight 
Make sure, everything you endure stays tight

In a quarter,
On the way of the manslaughter,
So I approach the man,
The keys to the car, cash and the coke,
Get the fuck on the floor,
Or get smoked motherfucker,
Starin' at the trees on my trucker,
Jumped in the 3, I hit a bruptner,
I must've been doing about 80,
Some niggas gave chasin' a Mercedes,
I'm laughin', (ha ha)
Cocked my nine, and start blastin',

You know what they say
God forgives all sins
Except suicide
Then I guess I'll be alright
'Cause I ain't goin' kill myself
You know

I was raised atheist, God was a myth
Never prayed 'cause I never seen, and I was never with
Kneelin' on my knees, just thankin' Jesus
For stuff that I received when I wasn't receivin'

It's like
Thanks for the lights that ain't on
Thanks for the food that's gone
And my stomach's tight empty

Thanks for the clothes that ya sent me
They tight and kids laugh, so I be cuttin' school, a'ight
I want to thank you for my brother smokin' crack
I also want to thank you for my cousin gettin' shot in his back

I want to thank you for my friends that's gone
I mean they all under thirty right, but life goes on
I want to thank you for my moms being sad
Thanks for the house with the swimming pool I never had

I want to thank you for my Uncle Bill, smart enough to get his PhD
He got HIV
I want to thank you for my pops, what a joke
Work hard all of his life and got nothin' to show

I want to thank you for the lives that you moved
I also want to thank you for the cancer that you gave E-Smooth
And I'm sorry my belief is low, can you tell me where to go
Heaven or hell, eleven to twelve

And I'm ready when you ready, just tell me don't breath
Will you forgive me 'cause I didn't believe?
All I know is that...

[Chorus]
When it's my time to go
All I want to know 
Am I gonna see him or see you?
Give me a clue, tell me what to do
Will you open the gates or am I through
Forgive me for my negatvie thoughts and all my sins
From what I know now Lord I wish I knew then
I seen a lot of bad, never had reason to believe
Now I simply thank you for this air that I breath

[Lord Tariq]
Yo, you know people used to say this kid's really crazy
That religion and forgivin' church stuff never fazed me
Livin' off the word of a teacher
My friends up the block gettin' fat sellin' crack to the preacher

Johova's witness says he witnessed, but he never seen
What he seeks is forever green, and he forever fiend
I used to hit the mas now and then
Me and X used to bill with these guys that was five percent

But see, one thing I learned in life being hard
Is no matter who you serve in life, there's one God
Whether you're black or white, Chinese, Japanese
You breath the same air I breath, bleed the same blood I bleed

That's why I'm sayin' you're wrong
If you're sayin' my song is blasphomy, just ask of me
I got God in me just like an artery
If I offended you then pardon me

The things I seen in life hardened me
Want to treat the next man like a slave
And go to church shoutin', holy ghostin' and
Claimin' you're saved

Then you think because the offer that you gave, you forgivin'
But you better fix the life that you're livin'
You want to be God-filled, steady sinnin', change your ways
'Cause you know it's really money that you praise

It's time to wake up, drop yo' blunt and put away the beer
'Cause I'm feelin' like the last days is here
For real

Who am I?
You can find me on a corner of your block
And I'm boning powder-forming transform into a rock
Who am I?
I suck the life out of a nigga put your dick in the sand
I'm transported through borders for grams
So who am I?
Small and white like shining so bright
Might take your son's life in the middle of the night
Who am I?
Chopped down a hundred packs for hundred stacks
And I'm sold through a hole through the wall
I'm controlling you all
So who am I?
My pipe game is wicked
And an hour get you by and it can be kinda fitted
Who am I?
I might last for five minutes, but that's all right
Because that 25 Mitch will get you high all night
So who am I? I'm born to kill blacks
And I'm made in the U.S. I'm known as crack

So who am I?
Very small, and I stashed in walls (who am I?)
I get you high and I'm smoked in halls (who am I?)
You must come if hear me call
So who am I?

That hang around Bloods and Crips
Mostly found around your drugs and whips
Find me in a artery
Somewhere in your body
While your lying there leaking looking at Lord saying ""soddy""
I was shot at the best
(fly) Hit many vests
But 9 out of 10 I pierce through many chests
Colorblind, hell if I'm not like fuck it
Kids and ladies and even babies kick the bucket
S'more like a rich bitch in the store shopping
Seven I pop, there'll be a lotta niggas dropping
Majority, minority die when I fuck
But I mean I'm just a bullet and I don't give a fuck

Now I pray on the ones who lust for sex and drugs
Shooting out dicks and needles polluting your blood
When I see you, and I see you
Corrupt and I'm up and who you fucking, who she fucking...

Yo I'm the biggest nigga on your block
And I kill more niggas than your glock
Like or not
I'm outta control
Pull your body outta your soul
Than I laugh as I watch your family watch you fold

Now you can catch me but can't kill me
Try to scare but you can't feel me

Probably be the end

And it's crazy how you say I make my money in vain
'Cause I talk about guns and drugs

But I rap what I see
But is this whole tree the clown cat that you see
And the ka-chap in me?

On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam

Hoe, damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat

Splat like Deja Vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Don P, Mo' with pistol
Just 'cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should mis doubt

Keep 'em near da fifties and hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich but bitch, I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope

From this freelancer contorted like a breakdancer
All over this place, wait, a mikes in his face
Finishing top five in the human race
No narcotic, just our product rushed to market
Dollars in the bulls-eye, charging red carpet
Ole, here to stay until tribulation or rescue me from eternal damnation
You chasing freedom, then clinch your fist
Put 'em cloud bound so opposition can't miss

There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature

It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most

Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member go on your great adventure again
They will be waiting at the end

And my necklace is of opal, I tie it and untie it

And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes

So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me

Don't hang around as the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when I'm the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a sarlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle till dusk sky
See now the stars burst
Looks just like a blood orange

All we need is lightning

Striking down the prophets of false

Rock 'n roll angels bring thyn hard rock hallelujah
In God's creation supernatural high

Thou shall be saved
Brothers and sisters keep strong in the faith
On the day of Rockoning
It's who dares, wins
You will see the jokers soon'll be the new kings

All we need is lightning
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising
Give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe

Rock 'n roll angels bring thyn hard rock hallelujah
Demons and angels all in one have arrived
Rock 'n roll angels bring thyn hard rock hallelujah

Wings on my back
I got horns on my head
My fangs are sharp
And my eyes are red
Not quite an angel
Or the one that fell
Now choose to join us or go straight to Hell

Lordi,"This is an SCG3 Special Report with Sam Romero.

""Good evening, I'm Sam Romero. We continue our special rapport now on the so-called monster invasion. As of eleven AM today, the president has declared the nation to be under Marshall law. Reports coming in now indicate that mass hysteria continues to spread throughout the globe. It is not yet confirmed by officials what is causing these horrific events, but it is suggested by certain sources that these creatures that are now being spotted throughout the world, are neither human... nor are they wild animals. It is strongly advised that people should stay indoors and if you encounter one of these beings, do NOT try to make contact with them... They will attack without warning! Our very own William Tracey in the sky is now reporting.

Will?
Sam! We're here hovering over down-town
where the monsters are litterly swarming the city!
The freeways are glocked
There is absolutely no way out of down-town.
These creatures, they are incredibly strong.
A few minutes ago we saw one actually pick up an SUV and throw it in a clump of people.
And then, zoom in on that, yeah.
Are we getting that? It's actually looking at us!
It's, it's climbing. It's
No, pull up, pull up, pull up!

[Sam:] Will? Ehm, we seem to be suffering from technical difficulties. We'll get back to William Tracy as soon as we get the satellite feed repaired. Hm... In the meantime, we now go live to Joan Carr at the Hellbender Plaza. Joan?...
[Joan:] Sam! I'm standing here with thousands of citizens. The first thing that greeted us when we drove up was the smell of decomposing flesh! The dead are litterly walking the streets! Aah... Even though the people know about the curfew, there is absolutely no trace of police or the military yet. It's understandable that the people feel the urge to get out of their homes and go look for their loved-ones. They don't know what to do and how to cope with all of this. Aah... Something is happening. Eehmm... Oh my God! RUN!!!
[Yelling]
[White noise]

[Sam:] We ehm... seem to be experiencing some more technical difficulties with Joan as well, so... Ehm... I'm just being told that someone is infiltrating our broadcasts. Eh... Are we going off the air?..

[Strange monster voice / Dee Snider:] Good evening, you puny little humans. Don't try to adjust your sat's, we control the transmission. Your deminion of the earth has gone on far too long. You've had your chances, you've blown them all! Now it's time to cut the bullshit. You are a plague! We are forced to take disciplinary action. Behold the sounds that will grind your insides, the sights that will make you blind. Your walls of iron will bend and the seas will run red with your blood. The earth will quake and open its fuming maw swallowing all the heretics and fools on the wide path to hell. The skies will open with a thunderous raw! My little pets will fly out in swarms that will block the sun. They will kiss the flesh off the bones of those who still choose to follow the false prophets. Join us or forever drown in the pit of despair. The Scartic Circle Gathering is now. This is the day of reckoning. This is...
