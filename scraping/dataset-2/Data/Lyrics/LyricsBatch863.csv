Prinz Pi,"Morgens auf dem Schulweg schon, nahmen wir die gleiche Bahn, 
Gleicher Stundenplan, gleicher Tag, gleicher Song, 
Sponnen uns unseren Plan, wo sind die verschwundenen Namen', 
Die wir all den Dingen gaben, lang bevor die Wunden kamen,
Hassten die gleichen Lehrer, schwärmten für die selben Weiber, 
Ich hör' Rap noch heut', doch damals war er 10 mal geiler.
Teilten uns Minipizza, später dann die Wunschkippen, 
Starter Caps, schwarze Tags, auf Parkbänken rumsitzen, 
Zäune war'n zum Rüberklettern, 
Jeder Tag Abenteuer, Boot stehlen, 
Notraketen in die Nacht über der Havel feuern, 
Nichts wärmte mehr, als die unerlaubten Lagerfeuer, 
Als jede Story nagelneu war, und nicht wiedererzählt, 
Und wiedererzählt, und in der Erinnerung wiedererlebt.
Oder wie hier, von mir, konserviert in Lieder gelegt,
Wie man's auch wendet und dreht, der gerade, bleibt der schwierigste Weg.

Alle Welt will den Neubeginn, 
Doch ich will nur, dass der alte Wagen weiterläuft, 
Wo sind all die Freunde hin,
Auf den Fotos lachen wir für immer, und niemand kann uns nehmen, 
Was schon lange nicht mehr da ist.

Alle Welt will den Neubeginn, 
Doch ich will nur, dass der alte Wagen weiterläuft, 
Wo sind all die Freunde hin,
Auf den Fotos lachen wir für immer, und niemand kann uns nehmen, 
Was schon lange nicht mehr da ist.

Wie sich halt immer die Wege trennen, nur unsere nicht, dachte ich,
Bis dann der nächste aus der Rufliste verschwunden ist,
Guck durch mein Telefonbuch, 
So viele Nummern die ich lange nicht mehr anrief, 
Und ich vermisse die Momente die wir teilten, 
Mein Gesicht hüllt sich in Dampf dann, wenn ich langsam, 
An der Kippe zieh', heb mein Glas, ich trink auf uns, 
Doch trink allein, 
Die eine alte Freundin die noch immer da ist hinkt herein.


Wo ging' all die Freunde hin, wir rufen an, 
Irgendwann, doch sehen uns bei Facebook am häufigsten,
Wo ging' all die Freunde hin, bis dann
Irgendwann, sagen wir und denken, dass wir nicht käuflich sind.
Doch das Leben kostet jedem dann am Ende doch sein Leben, 
Und besteht auch im Ganzen gesehen nur aus tausenden Details, 
Und in jedem, wirklich jedem, steckt bei Licht besehen, der Teufel drin.

Hab Freunde verloren an Weiber,
Freunde verloren ans Geld, 
Freunde verschwanden und wohnen am anderen Ende der Welt, 
Freunde verloren durch paar Freunde, die gar keine waren, 
Freunde verloren an den Suff und die kleinen weißen Bahnen, 
Freunde verloren an Zweisamkeit, an Eigenheim, an Frau und Kind
An den wesentlichen Sinn des Lebens an sich, 
Freunde verloren an ihre Chefs, an Ehrgeiz, an den neuen Porsche, 
Geld ist erste und ewige Pflicht.",Asoziale Kontakte,2013
Prinz Pi,"Sonnenlicht scheuert an Holzstühlen
Drei Wochen noch bis zu den Zeugnissen
Und noch wurden aus uns nicht die großen Arschlöcher und Teuflinnen
Die wir heut' sind
In den Sommerferien geht es endlich los
Zeit und Freiheit grenzenlos
Es beginnt bestimmt, nach dem Sprung vom Dreier
Dem ersten Wu Tang-Songtext runterleiern
Dem ersten Mal was klauen, dem ersten Kuss mit Zunge
Der ersten Schlägerei, dem ersten Zug auf Lunge
Dem ersten Mal ihren Busen sehen
Nachts auf dem Dach rauchend, beginnen alles zu verstehen
Dem ersten Mal auf Demo gehen, Harten machen, Stein schmeißen
Wegrennen, Herz schlägt bis zum Hals einscheißen
Dem ersten Konzert, teil sein eines Lifestyles
Schwitzen, tanzen, dabei sein, Freiheit!

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Nach roten Lippen, nach großen Klippen
Nach Gauloises Kippen schmeckt der Kuss der Freiheit
Nach Kiffen schmeckt der Kuss der Freiheit
Mama, ich muss los, muss dabei sein
Es beginnt, auf der Abifahrt, ab nach Prag
Im Bus Wodka Bull, egal, was der Lappen sagt
Nach der ersten Dieseljeans,
Nach dem ersten graumelierten Apparel-Hoodie, sicher nach dem Zivildienst
Nach dem ersten Streit, wo Mama sagt „Pack dein Zeug!”
Nach dem ersten Mal, wo dich dein bester Freund krass enttäuscht
Weil er die Frau, die du liebst, küsst
Nachdem du dein Zuhause mit dem Waschmittel aus der Jeans schwitzt
Und du lernst diese unheile Welt kenn'
Von Zuhause komplett bis zum Melt renn'
Nicht mal sich selbst kennen, werde ein Felsen
Mit Nathalie Portmans Zwilling im Zelt penn'
Nach der ersten großen Liebe, die gescheitert ist
Nach der zweiten Woche, wo der Regen weiterpisst
Nach der Diplomarbeit, nachdem der erste Lohn beweist
Dass es diesmal fast bis zum nächsten Monat reicht

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Ich warte, dass mein Leben beginnt
Und ich weiß, was ich will und ich weiß, wer ich bin
Bald nicht mehr Fähnchen im Wind
Lauf schon so lang, nur weiß nicht wohin

Hat nie richtig angefangen, immer nur irgendwann
Nach dem Nächsten dann, wann fängt's mal wirklich an?
Bin nie angekommen, nur einmal angenommen
Dass nix mehr andres kommt,
Dann war's das schon
Es hieß „Leb dein' Traum“ Doch was ist mein Traum?
Haufen Frauen? Dann Job und Haus, mal schauen
Es hieß „Leb dein' Traum“ Und ich träume noch
Auch heute noch, mach meinen Pseudojob

Nie richtig angefangen, immer nur irgendwann
Nach dem Nächsten dann, wann fängt's mal wirklich an?
Bin nie angekommen,
Nur einmal angenommen, dass nix mehr andres kommt
Dann war's das schon

Hat nie richtig angefangen, immer nur irgendwann
Nach dem nächsten dann, wann fängt's mal wirklich an?
Bin nie an,
Nur einmal angenommen
Andres kommt,

So treibe ich verloren in ein unbekanntes Morgen

Die ersten sind gescheitert, die ersten was geworden
Die ersten wurden Eltern, die ersten sind gestorben
Bob Dylan gab mir einst einen Kompass ohne Norden

Erst gestern war der Abiball und unser Direktor sprach
Von unserer leuchtenden Zukunft am letzten Tag
Das Gruppenbild, beliebte und Randgestalten
Foto hat die Zeit für ein Hundertstel angehalten
Die Jungs trugen Anzug, manche haben sich reingezwängt
Fühlten sich eingeengt, manche haben ihn anbehalten
Noch beisammen wie die Kugel eines Löwenzahn
Bevor die Böe kam und uns in die Höhe nahm
Schule verblasst, Himmel so weit
Zivi verstreicht, Uni erscheint
Und der junge Mensch treibt
Er treibt, er treibt es gerne zu weit
Neue Freunde finden an den Fakultäten
Um auf Erstsemesterpartys einen Fuck zu geben
Das Mensaessen sehr gut um abzunehmen
Samstag Laster leihen, mit Eltern zu Ikea gehen
Viel Sommer gesehen durch Fenster von Bibliotheken
Anstatt zu leben wie in der Stadt daneben
Trotzdem nichts verstehen, Sex im WG-Zimmer
Nach Erstsemesterpartys, Irgendwas geht immer

Gestern paar getroffen, zwei Tage in der Heimatstadt
Hatte nach nur zwei Stunden meine Heimat satt
Zwei alte Lehrer kamen, vier Leute aus der alten Klasse
Auf seinem Jugendzimmerboden lag die kalte Waffe
Als ihn sein Vater fand, auf einer Karte stand
„ich bin zurückgegangen“
Ein anderer hatte gerade seinen ersten Tag im Außendienst
Als sie ihn abends aus dem Wrack von seinem Audi ziehen
Noch einen Monat lebte er weiter auf Bildern
Bis seine Pinnwand, letztendlich still war, das Pärchen seit der Zehnten
Von dem alle sagten
„die werden heiraten“
Sind seit zwei Tagen Status, es ist kompliziert
Und es wird komplizierter
Mit jedem neuen Tag wird das noch komplizierter
Wer das nicht kapiert hat, bisher nicht kapiert hat
Kann nur jemand sein, der noch nie geliebt hat

Meine Eltern sind enttäuscht von mir
Und deren Eltern sind enttäuscht von ihnen
Und ganz egal, welchen Weg man läuft
Mit jedem Schritt tritt man auf Minen
Meine Kinder werden mich enttäuschen
Und deren Kinder werden die enttäuschen
Und deren Enkel werden die enttäuschen
Wir jammern gern, so sind wir Deutschen
Hab gestern ein' wieder getroffen mit ihm paar Biere gesoffen
Den ganzen Abend hat er durch meine Miene gesprochen
In den Spiegel hinter mir, er ist jetzt sehr erfolgreich
Redet von teuren Uhren, hohen Steuern und dem Goldpreis
Wie er stetig steigt und über viele Frauen
Die ihn alle wollen und er selber will immer
Über den Aufsichtsrat, sein neues teures Auto
Nach dem vierten Bier wird er für mich lautlos,
Und ich schrei' „Was hast du schon erreicht?“
Du bist nur der größte Hai in deinem kleinen Teich
Doch es kommt stets ein größerer, besserer, stärkerer, cleverer, Hai
Sei ein Mensch und kein Hai, Mensch!
Zwischen den Beinen von den Sekretärinnen
Findest du keinen Lebenssinn, verlierst nur deinen Ehering
In deinem Lebenslauf

Wenn wir mal Hemden tragen, dann bleibt der Kragen auf
Sneaker aus den 80ern, Musik wie in den 70ern

Leben nach der Formel „Je retro, desto neu“

Im Apple Store da zahlen wir Raten ab beim weißen Gott

Chats, Text-Messages und Touchscreenberührungen

Schnelle Ergebnisse, easyjet-Wochenenden
Es geht „Profilbild geil“, Status liken
Dann in Chat, alles klären
Treffen, trinken, kurz ins Bett, wieder weg
Immer fertig sein, man, war das gestern heftig
Szene Make Up, Augenringe, jeden Morgen übernächtigt

Akku auf dem letzten bisschen

Pack' den Jeep voll mit Pasta und Konservendosen
Guten Filmen, guten Büchern, musikalischen Idolen
Einer Axt für das Brett vor meinem eigenen Kopf
Alles was mir wichtig ist, passt in eine kleine Box
Die vergrabe ich und schreibe Pandora drauf

Kein weißer Blitz aus Tod
Kein Präsident im tiefsten Bunker tippte seinen Code
Kein Kampfgas tränkt die Luft mit Tod

Kein David gegen Goliath kämpft solang er kann

Wenn die Flüge billig werden, dann freut euch das doch auch

Natürlich zieht die Firma weg in ein fernes Land
Und baut auch unsere deutschen Autos hinterm Sonnenaufgang
Es ging noch nie so lang so gut, irgendwann ist Schluss
Ihr wurdet reich, ihr wurdet weich, für niemand gibt es Schutz

Heute bin ich schon etwas weiter: Abi gemacht, Uni geschafft
Tochter kann sprechen und nennt mich Papa
Doch bleibt eine Wolke, ein dunkler Verdacht unter mei'm Dach
Mein Lebenslauf ein unregelmäßiger Slalom

„Denk mal an später, du hast ja keine Ahnung, Junge“

Höchste Höhen, tiefste Tiefen

Macht mich klein, sie wird mich stets verfolgen

Ist's schon wieder so nah?
Die Schatten kommen aus den Ecken
Schwarze Gedanken fluten den Raum
Momente von Glück ertrinken
Die Lichter verschwinden, in dumpfem, pochendem Grau
Wege heraus versprechen Tabletten
Verschrieben von Männern mit schütterem Haar
Trips wie das Leben sie schrieb, sind dann so nah, bitter und wahr
Manchmal sind mir die Menschen zu viel, ich will nicht mehr reden
Sie fragen wie's geht, ich denke zu Ende doch sage „ok“
Ich kann nicht tanzen, kann nicht Smalltalk
Kann nicht singen, nur lallen
Kann nicht schleimen, kann nicht lügen

Doch es ist nur die kurze Strecke, Straße vor dem
Nächsten Tunnel, auf dem Weg in Richtung Nichts

Höchste Höhen, tiefste Tiefen
An warmen Tagen glaub ich wirklich

Prinz Pi,"Wir haben einen Platz, der nur uns gehört
Einen geheimen Satz, der nur uns gehört
Und der bleibt für den Rest der Welt unerhört
Damit uns kein Zweifel unseren Wunsch zerstört
Denn, einen Wunsch hat jeder frei
Der Druck fällt, Brust schwingt wieder federleicht
Kein Monster mehr, das aus dem Nebel steigt
Mehr Monster werden komm',
Doch sie komm'
Erst mit dem Dunst raus aus dem Abend
Und sollen sie doch komm'
Denn, wenn sie komm', werd' ich alle erschlagen

Der erste Stich von der Nadel, wenn sie die Farbe
Zehn Zentimeter über mein Herz sticht
Schmerzt mehr, als ich dachte,
Doch niemals genug, um zu zeigen, wie sehr es mir ernst ist
Bis dein Name auf meiner Brust fliegt
Narben beweisen nicht Schwäche
Sondern nur, dass uns keiner kaputt kriegt
Dass uns so schnell niemand mehr klein macht
Mit dir ist es endlich, unendlich einfach
Erst teilen wir Kippen, dann teilen wir Lippen
Wir schreiben unsere eigenen Hymnen
Wissen, dass unser Leben ein Kinofilm ist
Zwei Stars ohne Make-Up im schmierigen Licht
Pedal auf das Blech, uns kriegen die nicht
Der alte Revolver fällt aus dem Bund
Ziel auf den Nordstern, Rebellen ohne Grund
Erst blitzt Licht aus dem Lauf, dann hallt Donner
Und alles verstummt

Neben den Lichtern der Tanke
Leuchtet grün „Exit“ in dunkelster Nacht
Doch wir renn' durch das Loch im Zaun, das nur wir kennen
Zu unserem Platz (zu unserem Platz)
Die haben uns Tag für Tag runtergemacht
Kampf ist verloren, die Wunde noch nass
Doch wir renn' durch das Loch im Zaun, das wir nur kenn'
Zu unserem Platz (zu unserem Platz)

Was die Welt auch macht mit uns
Die gibt einen Fuck auf uns
Doch das ist nur unser Platz
Und hier, gibt es nur Platz für uns

Nur wir beide kenn' den Weg, der zum Platz führt und schwören uns,
Wir werden ihn niemand' verraten
Wenn alles zu viel wird, dann renn' wir hierhin
Um endlich wieder zu atmen das Braun, deine Haare,
Das Braun, deine Augen werd' ich nie
Gegen ein anderes tauschen
Was du sagst, mildert das Rauschen von draußen
Und sind wir umstellt
Von unserem Scheitern, dann bauen wir auf Räuber-Art Leitern
Das Leder der Jacke schon rissig und alt
Der Kragen, der schützt gegen Stiche am Hals
Wird das Feuer mit der Finsternis kalt
Und stirbt von gelb zu rot zu schwarz
Dann auf die Toten in die Glut ein Glas
Neun Teufel und ein Engel raufen in mir
Lerne zu glauben mit dir, brauch' kein Foto, mein Schatz,
Denn du bist auf den Lidern der Augen von mir in die Haut tätowiert

Neben den Lichtern der Tanke
Leuchtet grün „Exit“ in dunkelster Nacht
Doch wir renn' durch das Loch im Zaun, das nur wir kenn'
Zu unserem Platz (zu unserem Platz)
Die haben uns Tag für Tag runtergemacht
Kampf ist verloren, die Wunde noch nass

Die gibt einen Fuck auf uns
Doch das ist nur unser Platz und hier
Gibt es nur Platz für uns

Ob du den schnellsten Carrera oder schrottigsten Golf hast
Die Wand bleibt Beton, betrachtet bei Vollgas
Sechs Kugeln haben im Colt platz
Ob im Morgengrauen Bier auf der Parkbank oder Champagner
Nachts auf dem Golfplatz, scheißegal, wie du dich voll machst
Sechs Kugeln haben im Colt platz

Neben den Lichtern der Tanke(Lichtern der Tanke, den Lichtern der Tanke)

Prinz Pi,"Dumpf ist der Nachhall in einem Korridor voller Stahlspinde
Und scharf an den Rändern der Bifokallinsen
Gebäude wie aus Level Editoren, surreal
Gezeichnet mit dem Lineal, runde Menschen sind egal
Matt ist das Metall vom Schlitten, lang ist der Hall vom Klicken
Nach dem letzten Schuss, in eine zerfetzte Brust
Tausend Fragen, hängen wie warmer Atem in der entsetzten Luft
Vor dem Absperrband
Vor den Kreide-Markierungen auf dem Tartanboden
Stehen die Trauernden neben den Ahnungslosen
Und errichten ein Meer aus kleinen Fotos in Rahmen und Rosen
Während die Kameras sich nähren am Grauen
Die Bilder im Magen der Medien verdauen, die Story zerkauen
Zu einem Brei aus Worten, der beschreiben will, was man nicht beschreiben kann
Wie das Gefühl in seinem Bauch, von seiner eigenen Angst

Ich hab ihn gesehen, ein Blick in ein fernes Nichts
Weit hinter die Häuser, irgendwohin, wo Wärme ist
Ich hab ihn gesehen, wie er vor mir lief
Als wäre die ganze Welt um ihn herum nur vorgespielt
Ich hab ihn gesehen, für ein Tausendstel, einen Augenblick
Trafen seine leeren Augen mich
Ich hab ihn gesehen, im Gegenlicht, rote Farbe tropft
In seine schmale Silhouette aus seinem schwarzem Stoff

Blicke betäubt vor Angst, passiert ist, was deuten kann
Ich sah ihn noch fahren die Tragen, wie ein schwarzes Loch — so
Blicke nur verzweifelte, dieses mal holte er sich jeden einzelnen
Für jeden kranken Gedanken in seinem Hirn, war nichts wert
Hat er gedacht, Emotionen sterben ab
Ich sah ihn jedes mal, als ob ihn jemand auf den Fersen war
Er schrieb sich heimlich seine Listen, blieb zuhaus
Sagte stets er ist gefährlich und nun wissen sie es auch
Sah ihn noch, jedes mal als er alleine in die Schule ging
War kein ruhiges Kind, keiner der mit den Coolen hing
Schoss solang um sich, bis man die Gesichter nicht erkennen kann
Nun muss es der Wagen mit Antennen dran, oh
Man denkt, wir wussten es dich, dass seine Wut ihn verlockt
Halt, dass sie besser Menschen wären mit ‘ner Kugel im Kopf
War nie glücklich und die Tränen fließen neben seinem Handrücken
Doch er hat gelächelt, als er abdrückte, Kidd

Das was ich höre, hörst du das auch?
Stolz fängt es an, ganz klein hört es auf
Dein Gesicht in der Mitte vom Rauch

Aus prunkgroßen Sternen sickert das Licht
Einmal durch die Galaxie, uns direkt ins Gesicht
Bist von den Füßen bis zu deinem Hals mit Tinte geschmückt
Solang wir beide uns sehen können, verschwinden wir nicht
Du bist Gift, doch gegen dich weiß ich kein Mittel
Deine Augen drehen mich auf dreiunddreißig und ein Drittel
Und wenn ich wieder zu mir komme, dann ist es zu spät
Wir finden immer unser Bett, ganz egal wo es steht
Standard Ikea-Gitterbett hält uns gefangen
Das Feuer braucht niemand sehen, nur den Schein an der Wand
Und wenn es brennt, lass es brennen, lass es brennen verdammt
Wir schreiben mit der Asche uns hat keiner gekannt!

In unsrer besten Zeit
Da waren wir immer zu zweit
Und das Bett, das wir teilen, war nur dein, war nur mein

Stehen vor den Betten im Laden, du sagst wir brauchen mehr Platz
Der wird dann am Telefon für das Rauschen gemacht
140cm, unser Rechteck von Licht
Wenn die Matratze breiter wird, dann wächst der Riss, der es bricht
Wir haben diverse Differenzen
Das ist der Grund warum die Menschen denken
Wir beide würden immer kämpfen
Doch die Momente direkt nach dem Streit sind die Engsten
Und die größten Hoffnungen, die liegen hinter Ängsten
Haben keine Ohren, für was man über uns sagt
Die werden noch lästern, liegen wir schon im Sarg
Die Fäden wirken dünn, aber halten wie Stahl
Doch wie die wirken ist uns beiden egal

Prinz Pi,"Die Sonne geht wie jeden Abend langsam unter, ohne Grußwort
Orangenes Licht lugt dort über der Tanke, kurz vor
Bevor das blaue Neon den Namen Aral schreibt
Autos kommen, tanken, fahren, Ampeln schalten
Der Tag weicht
Kreuzung atmet im rotgrünen Rhythmus, stockend
Paar Kids jetzt, mit grad geholten Sixpacks hockend
Auf den Stromkästen, Handylautsprecher werfen Tonfetzen
Zu denen LEDs in Bremsleuchten zu Rot wechseln
Meine Finger ziehen das Silberpapier
Von der Flasche eines billigen Bier
Dessen angenehme Kühle sich niederlegt
Sie durch Windungen im Inneren rinnend in meine Tiefe trägt
In der Mitte, wo Gefühle schlafen wie graue Schatten
Es bedarf noch einiger Flaschen, um sie hinauszulassen
Leichte Vibration in meiner Hosentasche rechts
Und dann weiß ich, was die anderen Idioten machen jetzt

Mein Kreislauf und der Akku halten beide nicht den Abend durch
Die unbestimmte Angst, die mir seit Tagen durch den Magen kurvt
Verflüchtigt sich, Gedanken schweifen
Bleiben hängen in verdammten Schleifen, die Laternen fangen an, zu scheinen
Stadt zugedeckt von weichem Schatten, der noch Rot enthält
Verdammter Hund, steht mal wieder da im Hof und bellt
Heiser und hysterisch, in einem Rhythmus, den nur er versteht
Während eins der Kids da unten etwas fertig dreht
Bis das Purple Haze in blauen Wolken seinen Duft zu mir trägt 
Benzin und alter Regen teilen die Luft
Mit Rosmarin auf dem Balkon, das Beck's 
Mit seinem eigentümlichen Grasgeruch, eine weitere Nuance
Die Stadt strömt ein in meine Nase, Augen und Ohren
Dringt bei meiner Haut in die Poren
Aufgedrehte Mädchen in Schuhen, zu hoch, um gut zu laufen
Versuchen cool zu rauchen, Kippen leuchten, Lippen leuchten
Begafft von drei Männern mit dicken Bäuchen
Und Trainingshosen die Lebensfrohen und Lebensmatten
Die Leben wollen, die schon Leben hatten
Unter den Augen beige Schatten
Unter uns allen leben Ratten
Schluck rinnt die Kehle runter
Haar mit Haut, mit Gewebe, mit Schädel, mit Seele drunter
In den Ecken webt das Dunkel den Beginn der Nacht
Um drei Minuten nach neun heb ich den Hörer ab
Und deine Stimme ist so nah, als wärst du neben mir hier
Als du Schluss machtest, war neben der neun die vier
Deine Stimme ist so nah als wärst du neben mir hier

Prinz Pi,"War grad Schluss, nach sechs Jahren, als ich dich traf
Hab’ gedacht, bin nur zu einem, nämlich Scheitern, begabt
Dein Leben war Chaos - meines ja auch
Noch mehr Stress hat da keiner gebraucht
Schlaf’ bei meinem Kumpel jetzt allein auf der Couch
Konto im Minus, weiter ziellos, noch eine geraucht
Kein Auto, keine Wohnung, grade Tochter geboren
Mein Album floppt, hab’ fast alles in ei’m Monat verloren
Kohle reicht grade so für ein kleines Büro
Veschanz’ mich hinterm Mac, ganz allein und bedroht
Gehe weg, bisschen raus, ende weinend im Klo
Denk’ an dich, fühl’ mich weit unter deinem Niveau
Und dann treffen wir uns unter einem scheinenden Mond
Alles passt und ich gewinne meine Million
Fahr’ auf Tour und du weißt nicht einmal, was ich mach’
Denn wir sprachen über alles, aber nicht über das
Denn wir sprachen über alles, aber nicht über das
In einem schäbigen Hotel eine weitere Nacht
Ich schlafe gut, weil ich weiß nun hab’ ich’s geschafft

Das Leben zieht in Streifen von Licht
Vorbei am Gesicht, jeden Tag verlieb’ ich mich neu
Es sieht aus, als wenn es nie wieder klappt
Dann sind wir wieder im Takt, jeden Tag verlieb’ ich mich neu

Vorbei am Gesicht, jeden Tag verlieb’ ich mich neu
Es sieht aus, als wenn es nie wieder klappt
Dann sind wir wieder im Takt, jeden Tag verlieb’ ich mich neu

Wir ziehen zusamm’ viel zu früh, Streit wie nie
Diese dumme Art Streit, wo dann keiner siegt
Bin auf Tour wieder mal, wollte nur wieder mal
Anrufen, doch vergess’ meine Uhr wieder mal
Und du weißt, wo ich bin, die Groupies sind da
Die mit Herzen meinen Tourbus bemalen
Und in nur einem Jahr immer Krach und Streit
Doch ich liebe jede Nacht zu zweit
Durch die Scheibe in der Koje fällt das erste Licht
Und in mei’m Kopf ist nur dein Gesicht
Weil ich weiß alles wird besser werden mit dir
Und wir kaufen einen Hund, denn der pennt neben dir
Auf der Couch, doch ist da, dann, wenn ich’s nicht bin
Weil mir meine Songs verdammt wichtig sind
Bin ich Tag und Nacht weg, Kopf fällt in Krisen
Würde mich dann am liebsten doch selbst erschießen
Neben Licht ist Schatten
Und die schlimmsten Sachen hört man nicht auf Platten
Neben Licht ist Schatten
Und die schlimmsten Sachen hört man nicht auf Platten
Sondern nachts bei uns

Doch ich zahle auch für jeden ein’ Preis
Brauche all die Täler und die Krisen und das Drama danach
Alle Extreme und Probleme und den Wagen in schwarz
In dem ich durch die Stadt fahre, nachts ohne Ziel
Letzte Johnny-Cash-Platte läuft ab auf Repeat
Hab’ noch Umwege vor mir, Fehler dabei
Doch ich weiß, dass du jeden verzeihst

Die jungen Eltern nach dir ganz verrückt, wie wurdest du zu dir?
Deine Haare waren immer kurz, Schnitt wie die G.I.s
Deine Augen waren wie meine zwei Kreise blaues Eis
Dahinter mehr Eis und dahinter Ehrgeiz
Und ein Geist, der in einem eiskalten Meer treibt
Deine Kinder sitzen am Tisch, wo du nie saßt
Kauen lange auf jedem kleinen Wort, das du sprachst
Familienfeiern immer ein durchlöcherter Kreis
Auf dem großen Herd köchelt das Fleisch

Tankstellen und Golfplätzen, wir lassen deinen Namen in Gold setzen

Sollten jeder ein, zwei rauchen auf dich
Und wenn die Asche eins wird mit der Asche von dir
Bricht Licht durch die braunfarbene Flasche vom Bier
Und wenn der Wind dann die Asche zerstreut

Menschen können das nicht von selber, darum üben die das

Ich geb’ dir mal ein Beispiel von ei’m typischen Satz
In guten wie in schlechten Zeiten und so weiter im Gelöbnis
Weil wir wünschen, dass die besten Seiten uns bestimmen
In den Schatten lauert das, was man nicht gerne zeigt
Doch wohin es ohne Beobachtung wie von selber treibt

Doch bei ihr haben sie alles gemacht konserviert
Ihre Jugend für Jahrzehnte gestreckt
Was die Natur nicht selbst schafft, macht das Skalpell

Nur im Innern ist das Chaos noch viel größer, die Schnitte
Die keiner sieht, ziehen sich durch die Mitte

Wie viele Fehler hab’ ich früher gemacht? 
Wie viel werd’ ich noch begehen in der Kühle der Nacht?
Mit dem Alter wurde auch aus mir das übliche Wrack
Illusionen sind Drogen, für unsre Psyche gemacht

Bei all den Boten und Katastrophen die sie zu uns schicken?
Hab' doch das Gestern noch nicht mal verstanden
Kau' immer noch drauf, Ängste wuchsen so wie Kinder im Bauch
Hab’ angefangen wie jeder hier, Atme ein, atme aus
Eltern alles geglaubt, und dann Einsturz des Kartenhaus’
Meine Welt aufgebaut mit massig Songs und Textzitaten
Arme zugehackt mit Assen, meinen versteckten Karten
Weitergemacht wie jeder hier einfach durchgezogen
Rock- und Rapmusik nahmen mir die Furcht vor Drogen
Die vielen Strophen sparen mir den Psychologen
Und wenn die Ängste wiederkommen, muss ich sie nur wiederholen
Der Geruch von Parfüm hängt im Raum nach dem Abschied
Keine Spur, nur das Laken, das man am Ende nochmal glattzieht
Jede Rakete, die man abschießt zerplatzt wie ein Traum
Bis dann der Trümmerberg herabfliegt doch

Es ist alles nicht so schlimm, wie du denkst
Denn das, was wichtig ist, kriegst du geschenkt
Wir kommen und gehen ohne Gepäck, uns bleibt nicht mal ein Hemd
Es ist egal was alles hinter uns brennt

Letzte Reihe, krasse Spinner, beste Zeiten, blass erinnert
Tische bekritzelt mit Pac und Fuck Rektor Skinner
Ist mir auch heut nicht peinlich, jede Zeile passt für immer
Würd’ ich tätowieren, Platz ist genug
Auch die dreckigsten Fluten von Blut, die waschen den Bug
Denk’ ich auf dem kalten Flur, zehn Jahre nach dem Abitur
Bin ich wieder der unbeliebte Junge mit der Kackfrisur
Atme einmal durch, atme zweimal durch
Die Tür geht auf, die Augen geradeaus, zeig ihn’ nie deine Furcht
Wie es geht, irgendwie, danke, doch
Frag’ mich nur, wie lange noch frag du dich mal, wie lange noch?

Die Jungs sind kahl geworden, Mädchen sind bequem
Bisschen fett, bieder, nett, runde Rädchen im System

People around my age 
Had always been looking for something, I didn’t know what it was
And anything that was out of reality anything that would change 
The state of my mind
Seemed to be what I was really looking for
Only I never realized how mistaken I was

Da parken die SUVs, Leder riecht neu
Das brave Heer, atmet Teer, ich hab’ noch Federn für euch
Die meisten sind verheiratet, die wenigsten treu
Ich würd’s nicht geschenkt haben wollen, das Leben von euch
Wenn das Alter kommt, der Alltag sie frisst
Man lügt sich, weil’s bequem ist, ins Faltengesicht
Die allerbesten Weine die halten sich nicht
Und ich so: Klasse Sex, Flasche ex, nicht einmal abgesetzt
Atme nochmal durch, atme rasselnd durch
Die Tür geht auf, Augen geradeaus, ich mach’ die Sache kurz
Die eine Hälfte kaut weiter, die andre verstummt
Keine Krawatte, meine Platte, Rebell ohne Grund

Werde nie einer von euch, bleibe einer von denen
Die zu meinen Konzerten kommen, um mich weinen zu sehen
Einer von denen, die meine Zeilen verstehen
Weil man ihr Leben lang vor ihnen stand, wie vor einem Problem
Manchmal komm’ ich nach Hause, um die Kleine zu sehen
Um in dem Spiegel ihrer Augen meine Eignen zu sehen
Doch meine Schuhe stehen halt da, um damit weiterzugehen
Und die Frau mit meinem Namen muss es leider verstehen
Bleib du mal besser da in deinem kleinen System
Aber wenn du alleine weinst, hat das keiner gesehen
Bleib mal da in deinem bequemen, heilen Leben

Und an den Wänden prangen selbstgemalte Bilder der Kids

Auf der Brust, was man mir verlieh für die Siege
Körperlich topfit, bin eins mit dem Cockpit
Weiß im Schlaf wo jeder Schalter und Knopf ist
Kenne meinen Jet wie ein Teil meines Körpers
Reagiere aus Reflex ohne den Umweg durch Wörter
Jedes System funktioniert, doppelt gecheckt
Und auch ich funktioniere wie ein Uhrwerk perfekt
Gib mir Koordinaten und ich drücke den Knopf
Und ich drücke ihn sooft, wie man mir sagt, dass ich drücken soll
Wie man mir sagt dass ich drücken soll

Prinz Pi,"Hinter grauen Türmen Morgenrot
Von den Stürmen des Lebens in Kneipen getriebene, hier seitdem gebliebene
Zerriebene, trinken noch immer ihre Sorgen tot
In ihnen wogt
Auch nur hochprozentig vergorenes Brot
Lichtstrahlen in unbennenbaren Nichtfarben
Ziehen, biegen und schieben erste Schatten von sichtbaren
Toten Objekten, in denen die Lebenden schlafen
Wo Rollläden gelbgraue Barcodes auf sie malen
Ihr gleichmäßiges Atmen gestoppt von Alarmen
Gekappt von nach Geräuschquellen schlagenden Armen
Die Füße tragen noch müde Gestalten vor Spiegel in Bädern
Cremes ebnen Falten aus dem uns versiegelnden Leder
Farben verstärken Konturen der sich bewegenden Lieder
Die im Sinus der Tage Gefallenen erheben sich wieder
Augen, deren Blickachsen an sich selbst abbrechen
Haare landen auf der weißen Weite vom Waschbecken
Geformt vom Messer des Rasierers
Oberkörper deklariert mit der Beschriftung des ihn verhüllenden T-Shirts
Ein schwacher, Kreislauf mit in Wasser
Gelöstem Koffein und Glukose in täglich steigender Dosis
Hochgeholt und wieder mit von hastigen Fingern 
aus der Packung gefischten Zylindern voll Tabak gemindert
Bis das Herz einen geregelten Schlag gibt
Der beginnende Tag liegt
Unentschlossen vor uns
Wie eine noch nicht abgeschickte Nachricht

Und Elektronik wechselt in aktiven Modi, Antennen empfangen Daten
Die unsichtbaren Ketten legen sich auf die Sklaven
Keine Wand scheint die sie treffenden Blicke zu spüren
Böden getreten von Füßen
Schlösser öffnen klackend die Türen
Funken entzünden Gemische gestorbener Echsen der Urzeit
Mit Luft von Heute in Sphären aus Aluminium
Radios wandeln Wellen, in massengeschmackskompatible
Kompakt portionierte Lieder zum Spielen um
Blinker schlagen im Takt eines ruhenden Pulses
Nadeln zeigen wie weit entfernt die stets drohende Null ist
In metallenen Körben, dem nach außen projizierten Status des Fahrers entsprechend
Fahren Millionen in Körpern voller Hormone vom Ort wo sie wohnen
Ihre Atome in Richtung unerreichbarer Versprechen
Nach jedem neuen Auto kommt ein neues Auto
Nach jeder Scheidung kommt das Glück

Und ich stehe auf dem Dach des Hochhaus, über der Stadt voll Verbrechen
Die Sonne streichelt mit millionenkilometerweit hergereistem Licht ihre Dächer
In meinen Augen Explosionen
Und auf mein' Lippen ein Lächeln
An meinen ungeborenen Sohn
Ich kann dich nicht retten

Nur ein weiterer Tag, im Innern der Brust
Tut ein Muskel jeden weiteren Schlag, nur weil er muss
Was er tut bis zum Schluss
Was er tut bis zum Schluss
Da kommt nicht mehr, ich hab’s immer gewusst

Kampierend vor Türen, hinter den' die Bühnen aufgebaut

Sitze sind so dreckig wie einst
Brauchst nix sagen, weiß genau, was du meinst
Fuhrst zu zweit los, große Reise, aber kamst heim allein
Brauchst nix sagen, weiß genau, was du meinst

Uns're Zukunft haben wir so nicht gewollt
Blicken immer lieber zurück in ein Gestern voll Glück

Werden in weißgemachten Leinensachen hereingelassen
Ins Paradies, Paranoia vor der Alternative
Doch von oben gesehen, sind wir alle nur Parasiten

Prinz Pi,"Wir stehen ganz fest, während sich die Mode dreht
Man die alten Shirts auf den Boden der Kommode legt
Wieder ein neuer Slang, wieder ein neuer Trend
Ist mir alles scheißegal – unser Feuer brennt
Um mich die treue Gang, trennen um keinen Preis
Was wir auf den Rest geben? Einen Scheiß!
Wir sind wir und wir bleiben uns treu
Die gemeinsamen Tage, haben keinen bereut
Jeden gemeinsamen Abend, haben keinen bereut
Und wenn wir einen begraben, bleibt er hier als ein Freund
Weiß, dass er mit bei uns auf der Terrasse sitzt
Dass er für immer bleibt, auch wenn sein Körper Asche ist

Was ist von unsern Träumen übrig geblieben?
Hundert Prozent, wir haben nicht übertrieben
Wir haben geschworen, „Für immer!“, und das heißt für immer
Wenn dich irgendeiner fragt, Mann, dann sag, „Für immer!“
Für immer und immer, immer und immer
Für immer und immer, immer und immer
Für immer und immer, immer und immer
Wir haben geschworen, „Für immer!“

Wissen, wer die Freunde sind und wer die Feinde sind
Wissen vor allem, dass wir niemals alleine sind
Wie die Welt sich dreht, macht einen manchmal schwindelig
Bei allem, was passiert und wer weiß schon, was dahinter ist?
Alles ändert sich, Richtung ist falsch
Die alte Warnung ist noch nicht ma' verhallt
Wenig, worauf man zählen kann und darum halt' ich jeden Mann
Der es wert ist, in mei'm Kreis für ein Leben lang
Ich weiß, dass grade die Besten gehen ohne Grund
Ich höre jede Nacht im Flur noch meinen toten Hund
Und wenn das Abendlicht in dieser Farbe ist
Dann seh' ich auf meinen Arm an die Stelle, wo dein Name ist

Was ist von unsern Träumen übrig geblieben?
Hundert Prozent, wir haben nicht übertrieben

Für immer und immer, immer und immer
Wir haben geschworen, „Für immer!“

Wir leben unsre Träume aus
Schmeißen jeden Tag ein Scheit auf das Feuer drauf
Und nie geht dieses Feuer aus
Sondern brennt, wärmt mich und meine Leute auf
Ein paar haben's nicht bis hier geschafft
Und auf die geht unser letzter Shot
Den wir heben noch mit letzter Kraft
Euch gehört der Rest der Nacht!

Prinz Pi,"Die Leere uns'rer Wohnung lacht mich aus
Die Medizin in der Flasche macht mich aus
Für viel zu wenig Stunden und hinterhältig und verlogen
Wie sie ist, lässt sie mich mitten in der Nacht heraus
Vor dem Fenster leuchtet blau das Neonschild der Tankstelle
Unwirkliches Licht belächelt meine Anfälle
Allein im Zuhause, zuhause im Alleinsein
Jede, die sich angesprochen fühlt, wird auch gemeint sein
Im Kissen neben mir noch der Abdruck deines Kopfs
Dein Lippenstift frisst seine Spur im Stoff wie Rost
So weit, wie der Wagen fährt, weg aus dem zerbrochenen Traum
Tank ist voll, Tasche ist im Kofferraum

Ich geb' das zu, ich bin einfach weggerannt
Richtung Nord an einen Ort, wo ich mich verstecken kann
Hinter hohen Brücken und langen schlechten Straßen
An ei'm See klar wie Glas kann ich besser atmen

Die Nacht ist schwarz, da draußen ist es kalt
Das Feuer scheint im kleinen Haus im Wald
Die Monster, die uns jagen, wechseln die Gestalt
Ich bin sicher hier im kleinen Haus im Wald
Die Nacht ist schwarz, da draußen ist es kalt
Das Feuer scheint im kleinen Haus im Wald
Die Monster, die uns jagen, wechseln die Gestalt
Ich bin sicher hier im kleinen Haus im Wald
(Hier im kleinen Haus im Wald)

Ein grün-grauer Himmel vor der Frontscheibe
Das Auto ist mein Rettungsboot, mit dem ich davontreibe
Das meiste Gepäck, was ich mithab', ist in meinem Kopf
Die ganzen Sachen auszupacken hab' ich keinen Bock
Irgendwann fließt es doch alles raus und ordnet sich
Im Spiegel steht mein altes Ich mit Messer und ermordet mich
Bin reduziert aufs Minimum, Boxsack an der Fichte
Bandagen auf dem Schaukelstuhl plus eiserne Gewichte
Burger im Gefrierfach, Dosenbier im Kühlschrank
Auf der alten Anlage hör' ich mir Vinyls an
Die Stimmen toter Helden fließen aus den Boxen raus
Karohemd, Timberlands, Schrotgewehr mit Doppellauf

Ich geb' das zu, ich bin einfach weggerannt
Richtung Nord an einen Ort, wo ich mich verstecken kann
Hinter hohen Brücken und langen schlechten Straßen

In Funken aufgelöst verschwindet meine Chance
Die Flammen essen meine Briefe, alles war umsonst
Blick' zu tief ins Feuer und du weißt, wohin du kommst

Prinz Pi,"Ich habe keinen Bock mehr, keinen Bock zu haben
All diesen Ballast in meinem Kopf zu tragen
Es läuft beschissen, Mann, ich weiß, muss man nicht nochmal sagen
Ich will ja gar nicht viel, nur auch mal wieder Hoffnung haben
Etwas kitzelt mich, auch durch die Jalousie
Neues Licht, das sich fix über alles zieht
Eine neue Energie, die mich packt
Der ausgelutschte Akku ist nun wieder intakt
Ich mach' die Fenster auf, es riecht nach was Neuem
Ein anderer Wind weht, er zieht durch die Bäume
Er bringt mir Glück mit und ein paar Träume
Vielleicht sollt' ich wieder öfter unter Leute
Ich hol' die Sonnenbrille raus, die verstaubt im Etui
Zieh' nur meinen Pulli an und lauf' durch meinen Kiez
Die erste Sonne fällt auf meine Schultern – so gut
Tret' auf den Bahnsteig und schon kommt mein Zug

Und es ist Sommer in der Stadt
Nach jedem Tief kommt ein Hoch, Hoch, Hoch
Wir waren grau, wir waren matt
Aber jetzt ziehen wir los
Und es ist Sommer in der Stadt
Alles leuchtet hellrot, -rot, -rot
'Ne Menge Glück liegt auf den Straßen
Komm, wir heben es hoch!

Ich hab' die Schnauze voll davon, die Schnauze voll zu haben
Vor allem, wenn die Sonnenstrahlen die Stadt mit Gold bemalen
Alles sieht besser aus, alles sieht fresher aus
Ich höre aus dem Rauschen von der Stadt heut kein Gemecker raus
Das alte Ehepaar da sieht frisch verliebt aus
Selbst die alten Pflastersteine sehen frisch poliert aus
Mit andern Worten, hier sieht wieder wie hier aus
Sogar der DHL klingelt überall im Mietshaus
Etwas juckt mich im Gesicht, ich hab's vergessen
Ach, ich weiß, was das ist, das ist ein Lächeln
Hab' Lust mich auf die Bank zu setzen
Die Leute hören auf mich anzuätzen, die Hunde hören auf mich anzukläffen
Wir wollten 'ne neue Chance haben – hier ist sie
Die Depression von gestern, niemand vermisst sie
Die Sonne bringt Temperatur in mein Blut
Die Luft tut gut und ich nehm' noch einen Zug

Wir haben gedämmert, jetzt wollen wir wieder brennen
Von unserm Glück kann uns niemand trennen
Die Flieger warten nur darauf mit ihnen zu rennen
Aus alt wird neu, wenn wir's nicht erkennen
Der Akku rauf auf hundertzehn Prozent
Nie müde, jeden Abend Openend
Yeah, die Sonne gibt's geschenkt
Es wird alles noch viel besser als man denkt

Prinz Pi,"Parisienne, zu viel Rotwein
Weil ich weiß, du gehst mit irgendei'm Idiot heim
Cardigan, ein grauer Mondschein
Ich wünscht', in mir drin würd' alles tot sein
Feuerzeug, letzter Zug
Irgendwann bist du nur noch ein Dreckstattoo
Dein neuer Freund, Fleck von Blut
Faust schmerzt, vielleicht deckt er dich grad zu
Vielleicht war ich nur sowas wie 'ne Probefahrt
Vielleicht war als wir zusammen kamen nicht, der große Tag
Der das für mich wahr, was man so alles sagt
Wenn man zusammen ist, für mich war das alles wahr
Ich wollte mit dir Kinofilme leben
Der Cast war komplett, aber niemand will sie sehen

Wahrscheinlich ist er schlauer und viel reicher als ich
Die Sachen, die ich bieten konnte, reichten dir nicht

Prinz Pi,"Ich hab' mir mal ein Blatt genommen in meiner ersten Wohnung damals
Wo ich noch kaum Erfahrung, doch einen riesengroßen Plan hatt'
Hatt' keine Ahnung, doch viele Visionen
Pornobi Wan Kenobi geht auf Riesenmission
Auf DIN-A4-Papier hab' ich meine Ziele aufgeschrieben
Das erste hatt' ich grad erreicht: endlich auszuziehen
Dann viele Reiseziele, Finden von einer Liebe
Die nicht zerstört werden kann, von keiner Krise
Die so hält, dass wir noch Händchen halten bis zum Ende
Wenn wir auf Krücken gehen, wir lieben die Legende
Nach der Schule kommt die Uni, dann der Beruf
Und spätestens ab da wird leider jeder Tag zum Loop
Wir klettern eine Leiter hoch, irgendwann wird uns schwindelig
Denn hinter uns, da windet sich der Nachwuchs schon im Kindersitz
Doch im Hier und Jetzt ist alles Provisorium
Junger Rebell ohne Grund, lange Sätze ohne Punkt

Schon so viel Listen gemacht, so viele Kisten gepackt
Hab' mir viele Ziele aufgeschrieben bis in die Nacht
Den Sinn des Lebens geahnt, alles kam wie es kam
Und wurde irgendwie gut, aber nie, wie geplant
Schon so viel Listen gemacht, so viele Kisten gepackt
Hab' mir viele Ziele aufgeschrieben bis in die Nacht
Den Sinn des Lebens geahnt, alles kam wie es kam
Und wurde irgendwie gut, aber nie, wie geplant

In meiner kleinen Küche Billigrotwein für Romantik
Gucken kurz durchs Internet aufs unbekannte große Ganze
Alles Provisorium, vor allem die Beziehungen
Wir sagen, wir werd'n alt zusammen, dann fühlen wir uns wieder jung
Meine Lieblingsfilme: Utopien, was ist real?
Die Träume passen nicht ins Billy-Regal
Manchmal stolpert dir das Schicksal einfach rein in deinen Tag
Wenn es klopft, kommt es rein und bleibt da, das ist wahr
Alles, was kam, kam irgendwie in Slalomfahrt
Kam ungeplant, nicht angesagt, aber war dann da
Was kommen sollte, ist verschollen wie mein DHL-Paket
Was immer noch unabgeholt in der Filiale steht
Wir sind schon in so viele Sackgassen gegangen
Haben vertraut und uns aneinander furchtbar verbrannt
Die letzten Jahre, da war alles nur verflucht und verdammt
Doch das mit uns, das fängt grade erst an

Schon so viel Listen gemacht, so viele Kisten gepackt
Hab' mir viele Ziele aufgeschrieben bis in die Nacht

Ich übersehe die Millionen Hater

Treff' ein paar Brüder hier am Bergmannkiez
Es riecht nach Linden und nach Sternanis
Ich bin Gewohnheitstier, jeden Tag Falafel
Mein Leben ist 'ne Serie, jedes Jahr 'ne Staffel

Heut wird in fünf Sterne deine Haut gebräunt
Deine zweite Frau ist ziemlich jung
In ihrer Handtasche ihr Lieblingshund

Weiß, wie kostbar das ist, wenn man gemeinsam was macht

Denk an den Sandstrand, du riechst das Meer
Wellen brechen an deinen Füßen für den Südsee-Flair
Palmen wiegen sich im sanften Wind
Die Gischt schäumt, wenn man in der Brandung schwimmt
Ich könnte den Sand schon zwischen meinen Zehen spüren
Würde ich nicht dieses stinknormale Leben führen
Wo morgens der Wecker schreit, der Wecker kreischt
Wand fleckig, wohin ich jeden Morgen meinen Wecker schmeiß
Welt bleib bloß draußen, Nachrichten wieder mies
Alles was man liest sind Berichte von Hass und Krieg
Ich könnte Bände füllen mit was an einem Tag in dieser Stadt passiert
Doch ich hab nur dieses eine Blatt Papier
Und muss es komprimieren, Ordnung in das Chaos bringen
Während ein Zuckerwürfel im Kaffee in das Schwarze sinkt
Der neue Tag beginnt, ich sehe nur Probleme
Mann, wir waren mal blind wir waren mal Kind",Sandstrand,2017
Prinz Pi,"In der Straße vor mei'm Haus sind noch Spuren von den Donuts
In dei'm Lieblingsmantel hast du dich gefühlt wie Humphrey Bogart
Hast Mist gebaut, bist abgetaucht, warst U-Boot für einen Monat
Wir hörten einmal „Group Home“ im Loop tot in Verona
Wir haben Pläne geschmiedet, die waren riesengroß
Haben in der Nacht gelebt, war'n tagsüber klinisch tot
Haben das wiederholt, für mich war's zu viel irgendwann
Du bist noch immer auf der Party, du bist niemals gegangen
Trinkst noch immer für drei ohne einen Cent zu bezahlen
Deine Nummer tot, wohl wieder mal Handy im Arsch
Neue Türen erschienen, nur weil du sie sahst
Und du hattest auch für alle schon die Schlüssel parat
Oder kanntest den Türsteher, brachtest uns rein
Sahst das Vielleicht und schließlich Ja hinter dem Nein
Wir kamen als Niemand, standen nie auf der Liste
Gingen als VIPs und hinterließen Geschichte

Wenn ich in unserer Straße bin, dann spür' ich dich
Auch dein Ende war nur eine neue Tür für dich
Ich dank' dir für die Stunden, die wir hatten
Nachts hast du gebrannt, am Tag warst du ein Schatten
Wenn ich in unserer Straße bin, dann spür' ich dich
Auch dein Ende war nur eine neue Tür für dich
Ich dank' dir für die Stunden, die wir hatten
Nachts hast du gebrannt, am Tag warst du ein Schatten

Ich lebe noch in dieser Stadt mit allen unsern Plätzen
Dein Name ist an jedem Ort, wie könnt' ich dich vergessen?
Bin ich in dem Späti an ei'm Abend für Schnaps
Seh' ich dich noch um die Ecke laufen,  gerade verpasst
Ich renn' dir nach, doch du bist mir zehn Schritte voraus
Und unter einem gleichgültigen Mond gebe ich auf
Dein Leben war ein Feuerwerk mit Blumen aus Licht
Vorbei viel zu schnell, aber unglaublich hell
Jeder, der dich kannte, hat von dir noch ein Stück
Manchmal treffen sich ein paar von uns, sonst wären wir verrückt
Bringen jeder unser Puzzleteil und legen's zusammen
Dann ist es, als bist du nur mal kurz nebenan
Du bist nicht der erste meiner Freunde, der ging
Ich blicke in die roten Lichter, die da leuchten im Wind
Und bete, dass der Puls von uns allen noch schlägt
Wenn sich morgen wieder neues Licht über uns legt

Wenn ich in unserer Straße bin, dann spür' ich dich
Auch dein Ende war nur eine neue Tür für dich
Ich dank' dir für die Stunden, die wir hatten
Nachts hast du gebrannt, am Tag warst du ein Schatten
Wenn ich in unserer Straße bin, dann spür' ich dich
Auch dein Ende war nur eine neue Tür für dich
Ich dank' dir für die Stunden, die wir hatten
Nachts hast du gebrannt, am Tag warst du ein Schatten

Auf dem Friedhof hier sind circa tausend Leute
Und jedem von ihnen hast du etwas bedeutet
Jeder hier würde sagen, du warst anders als andre
Immer zweihundert Prozent, solange man dich kannte
Von deinen Kippen hebe ich mir noch die letzte auf
Auf meinem Handy ist noch unser alter Chatverlauf
Wir reden dann beim nächsten Mal, ich muss dir so viel erzählen
Ich kann es kaum erwarten, dass wir uns bald wiedersehen",Schatten,2017
Prinz Pi,"Ich bin allein mit meinen Sorgen, die am Tisch sitzen auf den leeren Stühlen
Früher saßen Freunde hier, gefühlt war immer Frühling
Wohnung kalt, Frau ist weg, dieses Jahr kein Weihnachtsbaum
Wir können den Untergang von unsrer Welt dieses Mal live anschauen
Ich würd' gerne aufwachen aus meinem Traum
Wirkt alles so unreal, bin Passagier in meiner Haut
Sitz', nicht fähig mich zu regen, auf dem Beifahrersitz
Ein andrer lenkt uns weg, aus der Heimat ins Nichts
Heimat war mein Hund, mein Sohn und meine Tochter
Heimat, das war Penny Lane, war Leni und Oskar
Heimat, das warst du, bevor Chaos in meinem Kopf war
Jedes Foto, das ich habe auf meinem Handy, ist so kostbar
Nachts, wenn ich im Bus lieg', irgendwo im Nirgendwo
Unterwegs zur nächsten Show, während meine Brüder schlafen
Lass' ich meine Seele los, blicke auf die Autobahn
Ins Schwarz, bis mich der Nebel holt
Ich hab' mir nie verziehen, wollt' sein wie Steve McQueen
Doch selbst mein letztes Hemd ist weg wie Supreme
Wer kennt schon das Gewicht von den großen Worten wie Depression?
Ich treib' allein durchs All an meinem Rettungsseil, dem Telefon
Stern um Stern wird ausgeknipst, ich zähle schon die, die noch brennen
Sich umkreisen, lieben, streiten und letztendlich wieder trennen
Ich hab' die Gedanken in mir selbst so satt
Manchmal wünscht' ich mir, es wär' für immer Nacht

Ich steh' im Trümmerfeld
Das war mal meine Welt
Ich würd' gern träumen, doch bin wach
Der Tag fühlt sich an wie die Nacht
Ich steh' im Trümmerfeld
Da, wo der Schutt noch raucht
Ich komm' hier irgendwann raus
Da vorne schimmert's schon hell

Es ist wieder so 'ne Nacht, wo ich im Auto sitze
Die Welt außerhalb der Scheiben eine graue Skizze
Hier hab' ich immerhin Kontrolle übers Lenkrad
Wenn ich nur wüsste, wer mich jahrelang gelenkt hat
Ich mag den Wagen, denn er ist was, was noch funktioniert
Ich hör' ihn atmen, wenn mein Fuß das Gaspedal berührt
Wenn das Schloss klickt, dann ist draußen draußen
Die Farbe von der Nacht ist genau wie deine Augen
Hier ist alles an sei'm Platz, Ray-Ban und Wrigley Spearmint
Ich mach' die Tür zu und es riecht wie Zeiten, die lang her sind
Wir haben getanzt auf diesen Sitzen, wenn unser Song im Radio kam
Brauchten kein Navi, denn wir hatten unsern Masterplan
Wussten, wohin wir fahren ist besser als woher wir kommen
Denn wir waren alle hier zusammen in diesem leeren Kokon
Jeder Sitz war voll, sogar unser Hund dabei
Ich hab' geglaubt, wir hätten für immer Zeit

Ich steh' im Trümmerfeld
Das war mal meine Welt
Ich würd' gern träumen, doch bin wach
Der Tag fühlt sich an wie die Nacht
Ich steh' im Trümmerfeld
Da, wo der Schutt noch raucht
Ich komm' hier irgendwann raus
Da vorne schimmert's schon hell

Ich träum' jede Nacht von einem Trümmerfeld
Ich träum' jede Nacht von einem Trümmerfeld
Ich träum' jede Nacht von einem Trümmerfeld
Ich träum' jede Nacht von einem Trümmerfeld
Ich träum' jede Nacht von einem Trümmerfeld

In dem jemand lebt, dann seh' ich das bin ja ich selbst",Trümmerfeld,2017
Prinz Pi,"Ich weiß nicht wie es kam, wir haben mit'nander geredet
Und gemerkt, wir sind beide von innen ziemlich beschädigt
Sind uns in vielem so ähnlich 
Fast schon unheimlich wie viel parallel ist
Wie die Form von einem G Mercedes
Vielleicht war's einfach nicht der richtige Moment
Weil mein Verstand stets alles wichtige verdrängt
Es gibt ein' Teil von mir der immer an dich denkt
Wenn ich nachts den Wagen in die Tiefgarage lenk
Du warst eine Chance und ich hab sie verpasst
Das Wort, was ich am meisten in jeder Sprache hasse ist „fast“
Du hast die Lücke geschlossen und nahtlos gepasst
Wir haben immer so locker und harmlos gequatscht

Und vielleicht 
Vielleicht, vielleicht, vielleicht
Reise ich zurück in der Zeit
Sind wir dann beide bereit
Und dann heißt es nicht mehr vielleicht
Vielleicht vielleicht vielleicht
Reise ich zurück in der Zeit
Und sind wir dann beide bereit

Hat sich alles leichter angefühlt mit dir
Die Zeit verging schneller, wenn ich bei dir war, war ich endlich ich selber
Keine Maske und Schutzschild
Keiner der mich abcheckt auf meine Fehler und Schwachstellen
Das schönste war das Lachen, mit dir hatte ich dir beste Zeit
Auch wenn man's jetzt erst peilt, wie die vier anderen von den Jackson 5
Wir trafen uns im denkbar schlechtesten Moment
Total verstört und grade beide frisch getrennt
Ich will nur wissen, ob's dir gut geht, ich vermisse dich so
Vielleicht schicken wir manchmal die gleichen Blicke zum Mond
Und sie treffen sich da oben in der Scheibe aus Weiß
Am Ende bleibt uns bloß ein „Vielleicht“

Und vielleicht 
Vielleicht, vielleicht, vielleicht
Reise ich zurück in der Zeit
Und sind wir dann beide bereit
Und dann heißt es nicht mehr vielleicht 

Ich weiß, dass da etwas zwischen uns ist
Es hat für eine Millisekunde geblitzt
Da konnte ich uns're Zukunft sehen, einen Augenblick nur einen Moment
Doch einer, den man niemals vergisst
Ich weiß, dass da etwas zwischen uns ist
Es hat für eine Millisekunde geblitzt
Da konnte ich uns're Zukunft sehen einen Augenblick nur einen Moment
Doch einer, den man niemals vergisst

Hab' gar nicht geglaubt, dass es da noch jemand gibt
Für den alles in mir drin komplett magnetisch ist
Baby, vielleicht seh' ich dich, vielleicht siehst du mich
Für das, was du bist, für das, was es ist
Hab' gar nicht geglaubt, dass es da noch jemand gibt

Prinz Pi,"Die Prognosen stehen schlecht, doch wann standen die mal gut?
Es scheint an uns klebt Pech wie ein ranziges Tattoo
In den neusten Schlagzeilen wieder ein paar Tote
Trump-Sieg, Finanzkrieg, Klimakatastrophe
In der Bahn ziehen die Leute eine Fresse
Die Welt geht morgen unter, das steht heute in der Presse
Ich gebe zu, es wird nicht einfach werden
Doch wenn wir alles schwarzmalen, was für einen Grund gibt es, nicht gleich zu sterben?
Ich seh' das Elend auch und will es mit nicht einfach machen
Die besten Antidepressiva sind die kleinen Sachen
Wie könnt' ich schlecht drauf sein, bei dem Lachen von mei'm Sohn
Da ist Hoffnung von meiner Person
In seinen Augen ist das alles neu, die Welt ist etwas Riesiges
Wundervolles, Unbekanntes, in seinen Augen spiegelt sich's
Er braucht nicht viel, dass er zufrieden ist
Auch wenn er fast nichts weiß, so weiß es doch, was Liebe ist

Alles wird gut, auch wenn alles dagegen spricht
Auch im schwärzestem All brennt ein Lebenslicht
Ja, ich weiß, die Statistik, die ist gegen mich
Doch das sind nur Zahlen und die zählen nicht
Die besten Zeiten liegen vor uns, auch wenn alles dagegen spricht
Auch im schwärzesten All brennt ein Lebenslicht
Ja, ich weiß, die Statistik, die ist gegen mich
Doch das sind nur Zahlen und die zählen nicht

Wo ist die Hoffnung hin, ich dacht', die stirbt zuletzt?
Irgendwann haben Zukunft durch Endzeit ersetzt
Irgendwas geht immer schief, irgendwo ist immer Krieg
Das wird nicht besser, wenn man depressiv im Zimmer liegt
Etwas im Magen drückt, keiner weißt, was es ist
Googeln wir Symptome, wird klar, dass es was krasses ist
Wir hören so viel Gerüchte, Wahrheit ist zu kompliziert
Und einfach nicht mehr für die Medien formatiert
Wir haben alle Angst, die ist schwer zu verstehen
Sogar die Uhren scheinen verkehrt rum zu gehen
Die Unmöglichkeiten eingetreten
Bleibt nur abzustumpfen und alles klein zu reden, ausblenden aus seinem Leben
An einfachen Lösungen erkennt man die Rattenfänger
In dunklen Zeiten, da werden ihre Schatten länger
Sie spielen Melodien, die nur ein Remix sind
Und zu einem Kampf führen, den man nie gewinnt
Ich kann den Hass nicht mehr hören, all das Negative
Es gab noch nie so viele Gründe für Nächstenliebe
Ich fang' im Kleinen an, fange bei mei'm Kleinen an
Highfive, hau' die große in die kleine Hand

Alles wird gut, auch wenn alles dagegen spricht
Auch im schwärzestem All brennt ein Lebenslicht

Die haben ihre Casios aus Ironie bestellt
Du denkst ""Rappt der da im Hipster Hype?
Mit 'ner veganen Bionade auf seinem Fixie Bike? Irgendwas im Fitti Style?""
Doch weit gefehlt, am Anfang war das Wort
Am Ende deines Dasein stehe ich in einer Short
Rapper von denen ihr glaubt, sie wären fresh, waren Placebos
Ich sitz' mit zwölf Brüdern an einem Tisch, als wär' ich Jesus
Wir trinken so hart, dass ich drei Tage weg bin
Dann wache ich auf, mit blassem Teint, wie Michael Jackson
Und einer Weisheit für meine Gemeinde
Wenn das Leben dir Melonen gibt, nimm sie in deine Wohnung mit
Keiner weiß, wie man deinen Name spricht, wie Häagen-Dazs
Wenn du dich für ein Genie hältst, dann lebst du in einer Fantasiewelt, wie Legolas
Ich regel' das, wie das BGB mit einem nachgestellten Nebensatz

Ist wie Schauspieler bei ihrem Nebenverdienst, sie spricht Bände
Jetzt mal Butter bei die Fische
Dich wundert das ein bisschen, ich bin unabgehoben, wie Fundamentalisten
Und gehe durch die Decke, wie der Scheich im Beduinen Zelt
Plus bringe Geist in das Herz dieser Maschinen Welt
Und nach meinem Tagewerk ruhe ich nicht wohlverdient
Sondern trage dein Yolo-Rap zurück auf das Holo-Deck
Quatsch nicht von Gürtellinie, denn die hängt so tief
Mit deinem Päckchen Weed in deinen verdreckten Jeans
Rapper reden von Penis, sie brauchen eine Messlatte
Es ging mir besser, als ich noch die Pest hatte
Es ging mir besser, als ich noch die Grippe hatte
Jetzt geht es mir schlechter, denn wir hören deine dritte Platte

Ich hänge ab, wie 'n paar dicke Titten
Ich hänge ab, wie die Araber bei City Chicken
Du willst haten, jetzt mal ehrlich, dafür rap' ich zu fresh

Das liegt doch auf der Hand, so wie Lebenslinien

Prinz Porno,"In den Jahren, wo ich verschwunden war, war ich stetig untertags
In Bibliotheken, um gänzlich ungestört vom
Fliehenden ? Leben einfach zu überlegen
Ob wir regiert werden, von mystischen Wesen
Von psychischen Befehlen geschickt werden
Lügen vernebeln, ihre Urheber stehen über den Regeln
Getragen durch Bilder und Worte, verpackt in kompakten Ideen
Im Konkreten sind wir gefangen, in abstrakten Systemen
Von Gesetzen, physikalischen, juristischen
Umso mehr ich studierte, wusste ich nur, wer ich nicht bin
Und wer meine Feinde sind, dass wir im All nicht allein sind
Die meinigen Texte haben eine zweiten Sinn
Über den leidigen Weg des Sprechgesangs in deinen Cortex
Wo sich die Idee erst fest, dann fort setzt
Yes Yo Raps, wenn du kein Strohhalm mehr hast, 
Dann halt dich an meinem Wort fest

Mir Amazon jedes Jahr ein neues FIFA schickt
Solang mein Supermarkt voll mit frischen Waren ist
All die Schmerzmittel wirken, ich beklag' mich nicht
In meinem Fernseher, da lebt der Günther Jauch
Er liefert mir die Bildung ganz bequem auf meine Couch
Und die Antwort auf die Frage die er stellt die hab ich auch
Wir sorgen für den Frieden, wenn ihr Waffen bei uns kauft
Ich mag uns're Kanzlerin, weil sie nicht verlogen ist
Und das deutsche Land kein Asyl für Edward Snowden ist

Prinz Porno,"Ey Toni, alter Kamerad, ich sitz' hier gerade
Am Frühstückstisch, bestreiche Schrippen mit Marmelade
Vor'm Fenster internationale Hipsterparade
Die mich stören beim Nachsinnen über wichtige Fragen
In meinem Kiez sind Touristen am Raven
Wollte mir nur kurz vom nächtlichen Schreiben mal meine Beine vertreten
Da versucht man Meisterwerke in sechzehn Takte zu gießen
Während sich Leute mit Chemos ihren Charakter vermiesen
Die verdammten Sub-Bässe rattern
Die Clubfressen gaffen auf einen der letzten Berliner, der nur seine Schrippen holt
Ich dachte, ich ruf mal durch und höre, was bei dir so geht
Während das Volk von überall in meiner Hood Videos dreht

Was bei mir so geht, was kann ich dir sagen
Ein paar attraktive Damen liegen nackt bei mir im Garten
An den Wasserskianlagen, ich häng ab in diesen Tagen
Und finde nichts, was ich nicht weiß in den Stadtarchivregalen
Nachts kann ich nicht schlafen
Ey yo, diesen Stephen Hawking hab ich in den letzten achtundsiebzig Schachpartien geschlagen
Ich will Submachineguns laden, denn ich brauch' Action
Seitdem selbst die Klitschkos keine Lust mehr auf Sparring mit mir haben

Ey, Boss, mal folgende Begebenheit
Man vergeudet seine Lebenszeit im Üblichen mit Trunkenheit und Schlägereien
In Dunkelheit von Alkohol und Drogen benebelt sein
Weil es bei den meisten doch zu Größerem ja eh nicht reicht
Doch zwischen all den Krepeleien, Werbung und Alltäglichkeit
Stieß ich vor kurzem auf einen interessanten Themenkreis
Durchs Internet, Entdeckung einer Inkastadt im Regenwald
Der Archäologe wurde binnen acht Tagen zum Pflegefall
Nach Beginn der Ausgrabung, wo Indioschamanen die weißen Teufel warnten, weiter zu graben
Da könnte man mal kurz die Wack-MCs Wack-MCs sein lassen
Den Learjet aus dem Hangar holen, etwas Kerosin verprassen
Du musst ja auch mal rauskommen wie Detox, mein Lieber
Das kann man hier so stehen lassen wie diese Mauer in China

Ey, jetzt, wo ich hier gelangweilt in mei'm großen Garten lieg
Vor mir das Fotografenteam eines Modemagazins
Wirkt die bloße Fantasie einer gefährlichen Mission
In 'nem Tropenparadies ja schon ganz attraktiv
Wenn man nur Großstadtstraßen sieht, vom Geld zählen müde ist
Erscheinen Adventures am anderen Ende der Welt echt verführerisch
Der Rest erübrigt sich, Fotoshootings können warten
Für todesmutige Taten, so, genug hier im Garten
Haut alle ab weg mit dem Kameragestell
Ist dieser Butler Samuel wieder beim Canasta-Duell
Mit Consuela und den Mädels der Hauswäscherei
Los, lauf einer los, holt mir den Faulpelz herbei
Hauptsächlich weil er mein Equipment packen muss
Und um dem Lauch mitzuteilen, dass er gleich mit mir fahren muss
Und das Equipment tragen muss, der Boss ist kein Backpacker
Ey yo, Pi, ich bin bereit und hoffe, der Jet ist klar

Im Untergrundhangar hinter geschmackvollen Parkanlagen
Ist der mattschwarze Learjet natürlich stets klar zum starten
Da die gottverdammten Models nur koksen und Champagner saufen
Und zankend Haze im blitzblanken Hangar rauchen
Gilt es, die schnell zu ersetzen
Wenn das Pirelli-Kalendershooting durch ist, dann haben wir neue Stewardessen
Und der Kapitän, die quasselnde, lahme Flitzpiepe
Tut, als würde er seine Waffen beladene MiG fliegen
Ich pack' mir meine Sporttasche, den Leinenanzug
Badehose, schwarze Pistole und seidenes Handtuch
Gelbes Mückenspray, geschmackvolle, geschmeidige Tücher
Und die Relativitätstheorie als Reiselektüre
Nur noch kurz die Beleuchtung von meinem Namen über der Stadt proben
Dann kommen wir dich in einer guten Viertelstunde abholen

Das ist zwar nicht der Komfort prächtiger Goldpaläste
Doch hier oben im Flieger über nächtlicher Wolkendecke
In Echtlederpolstersesseln mit Pumafellbezügen
Umgeben von Bräuten in sexy Stewardesskostümen
Die supereng anliegen, ist es auch nicht grad beklagenswert
Mal was anderes als ein Wohnzimmerabend mit Privatkonzert
Samuel, mein Glas ist leer, darum komm mal fix in Nullkommanix
Her und wehe du Dummkopf verkippst noch mal etwas vom Jahrgangs-Scotch
Nur weil du von dieser Dame da den Arsch anglotzt, die Maße hat wie Lara Croft
Pi, sag mir mal, wie war das noch auf der Internetadresse?
Du sprachst am Handy von irgend so 'ner Inkatempelstätte

Ja halt das übliche wir schleichen durch idyllische doch trügerische Steinkorridore
Beäugt dabei von übelsten Granitskulpturen von mystischen Götzen und Echsengöttern
Lass mich mal die Seite grade schnell auf meinem Laptop öffnen
Das Internet hier oben ist wie die Telekom da unten
Immer offline auch auf Hotline in jeder Form verschwunden
Einfach rauskommen aus dem Trott und durch Lianen in den Tropen waten
Während Stammeskrieger Curarepfeile in Bogen laden
Um uns kalt zu machen wie Eisskulpturdesigner einen Schwan
In dieser Leitkultur hat hier keiner einen Plan
Von den wirklich schweren Dingen
Aber guck mal da rechts wo ein erster Strahl Sonne den purpurnen Äther durchsetzt
Da genau unter der Tragfläche von dichten Wolken zugedeckt
Liegt eine Insel, nicht aufzufinden mit Google Maps
Da leben die, die Schluss machten wie Credit-Texter
Biggie, Pac oder Elvis, hier liegen sie in allerbester
Gesundheit in Strandstühlen, Endstation Südsee
Konserviert von Chirurgen, Ayurveda und grünem Tee
So jetzt ist die Page aber geladen, das hier meinte ich
Sagenumwobener Inkapalast voller Geheimnisse

Die Sonne geht auf, erscheint am Horizont blutrot
Wir sind mitten im Nichts so wie Robinson Crusoe
Und relaxen etwas nach den anstrengende Flugstunden
Bevor wir Fährten folgen, wie Suchtruppen mit Bluthunden
Das Vergnügen kann warten, denn ich wandle hier auf keinen mystischen Pfaden
Ohne Frühstück im Magen, ich will Rühreier braten
Kaffee und Burrito Snacks
Samuel hol Gasherd, Klapptisch und Mosquitonetz
Und halt das Ungeziefer von der Urwaldlichtung fern
Ich will nicht an Dschungelfieber oder Blutvergiftung sterben
Hab ich dann was im Bauch, dann kann das hier auch
Endlich starten, Pi, hol schon mal die Landkarte raus

Die Landkarte lag direkt neben dem Pfefferstreuer
Glaub, die hast du grade mit dem Rest der Bräute weggefeuert
Die einem keine Zeit für tiefere Gespräche lassen
Während Butler Heißgetränke einschenken in edle Tassen
Da liegt sie ja, studier du schon mal die Fliesenwege zum Tempel
Während ich dem Küchenchef die Leviten lese
Ey du Lausbub dein Krabbenomelett war schon traurig auf dem Boden deiner Pfanne verreckt
Also zack ran an die Kochstelle, paar Eier geschlagen
Und dann wird weitergebraten, so wie Haifisch in Asien
Und schwing mal die Tabascoflasche plus mahle Pfefferkörner
Denn der Prinz mag es scharf wie Samurais Katanaschwerter
Hurtig die Toasts in den Schacht reingeschoben wie U-Bahn in der Nacht in Metropolen
Die Frage ist doch nun lassen wir uns auf Händen tragen
Oder nehmen einen zur Hemdfarbe passenden Geländewagen
Oder schreiten gar selbst durch die wuchernde Botanik
Gehen mit gutem Beispiel voran, wie der Bug der Titanic
Und derselben Möglichkeit für den eigenen Untergang
Scheiß drauf, nun fangen die Adventures im Dschungel an

So lang die Wege es gestatten, nehmen wir den Wagen
Wird der Dschungel dann dichter, gehen wir auf den Pfaden
Und zwar so leise wie möglich
Verrät uns erst mal ein Schwarm kreischender Vögel, wird es leicht uns zu töten
Ich will auch nicht die Krieger des Dschungelvolks verschrecken
Die auf unerforschten Strecken im Unterholz versteckt sind
Und ihre wundervollen Schätze vor Fremden beschützen
Was glaubst du, was los ist, wenn sie uns am Tempel erwischen
Aber jetzt lass erst mal los, der Jeep ist beladen
Das erste Ziel ist schon nah, ich habs markiert auf der Karte
Wir fahren erst mal bis zum Kreuz an diesem Wasserfall
Vorausgesetzt, Samuel findet heute noch das Gaspedal
Jetzt läuft die Sache richtig an, ich glaub, ich sah
Erstaunlich nah ein Augenpaar durchs Dickicht starren
Sieh, wie der Farnbusch sich neigt, getarnt unter Zweigen
Beobachten sie uns, ich hab die Armbrust dabei
Und bin zum Warnschuss bereit
Denn die Pygmäen hier im Land sind eher weniger bekannt für ihre Harmlosigkeit
Doch wir fahren bloß vorbei auf den gewundenen Pfaden
Vorbei an Dschungellianen in den buntesten Farben
In dem verdunkelten Wagen
Denn lassen wir sie in Ruhe, versuchen sie auch uns nicht zu schaden
Dort unten im Tal, das muss der Wasserfall sein
Wir haben ihn fast schon erreicht vielleicht noch anderthalb Meilen
Aber halt, ich hab die Hand schon am Machetengriff
Siehst du den Baum mit der geschnitzten Aztekenschrift?
Guck, was daneben ist, siehst du diese Blutlachen?
Komm wir steigen aus und folgen den blutigen Fußstapfen

Ich entsicher bloß mal prophylaktisch ohne große Absicht
Die Waffe, falls doch noch einer ein Geschoss herabschickt
Denn auch ohne Nachtsicht, Fernglas oder Firlefarnz
Hab ich paar versteckte Krieger im grünen Gewirr erkannt
Folgen wir mal diesen Schriftzeichen
Jeden Umweg würde ich meiden
Auf uns zeigen dutzende von Giftpfeilen
In Blasrohren aus Bambus, aber scheiß drauf
Leben ist wie das olympische 3000 Meter Rennen, ein Kreislauf
Gut getarnt wie Echsen bahnen wir Pfade
Durch die Farngewächse wuchend über Straßennetzen
Der mystischen Tempelstadt, noch gut hundert Meter
Und wir sind an dem Wasserfall den du gesehen hast
Wenn die Karte hier stimmt, dann geht man bis zum Ufer
Und man springt dann, doch die stets langsame Dienerschaft
Deren Erziehung erschöpfend ist wie der Liebesakt
Der Libellen in Limastadt (der ja tödlich endet!)
Hat die Taucherausrüstung samt Sauerstoffflaschen
Mit ihrem letzten Funken Verstand zuhause gelassen
Ich hab schon größere Schätze aus einem reißend fließenden Fluss geholt
Darum Jacke aus und dann ganz tief Luft geholt

Mit einem geschmeidigen Sprung in das grünliche Nass
Nach dem üblichen Platsch sinkt meine Physis hinab
Im Augenwinkel reptilienhafte Schatten
Die mit kalten Augen ihr Ziel erfassen
Im Nacken wie Markennamen
Ich identifizere den Rohstoff von gut und gerne zehn Krokodilhandtaschen
Zwischen den schwarzen Fahnen
Doch man kann in diesen Wassern hier auch anders sterben
Große Piranhaschwärme heften sich an die Fersen
Zwischen Muränen und anderen Karnivoren stehen 
Versunkene Säulen im fahlen Licht wie Ganoven
Ein paar energische Züge auf etwa zehn Meter Tiefe
Seh ich den Eingang wie ein Maul gebildet aus Stalagmiten
Nach weiteren Schwimmbewegungen zieht der letzte Rest Luft 
Aus den gequälten Lungen, wie Raubtiere im Nebeldunst
Aufsteigende schillernde Blasen dort am Ende des schwarzen 
Tunnels seh ich Lichtstrahlen mit Killern schon warten
Darum steig ich aus dem Wasser zücke die Gun
Drücke sie dann macht es bam ba-ba-bam
Wie Ringo Starrs rechter Fuß mit der Drum
Und ich bin nur noch von kurz über dem Wasser sirrenden Mücken umtanzt
Die Gegner sinken nieder zu einem olivfarbenen Kleiderhaufen
Ey Boss, du kannst die Zigarre wieder weiter rauchen

Yeah, ich bin heiß gelaufen jetzt, wo hier der Spaß beginnt
Ich merke, wie mein Jagdinstinkt aufblitzt, wie mein Platinring
Es liegt Gefahr im Wind, ich kann spüren, wie nah wir sind
Ein Flüstern kommt von dort aus den Tiefen dieses Labyrinths
Ich nehm schnell die Fackel von der steinernen Wand
Halt sie mit eiserner Hand und jetzt rein in den Gang
Ein schleifender Klang, ein Rascheln und Knacken
Da war was, leider ließ es die Fackel im Schatten
Getrappel von Ratten, aufgeschreckte Fledermäuse
Siehst du den Lichtschein dort, der uns den Weg erleuchtet?
Da muss was - Vorsicht, eine Falltür im Boden
Und wir schlittern nach unten mit gewaltigem Tosen
Landen in Knochenbergen und angenagten Totenschädeln
Umklammert von Bodennebel, dann der Klang von Bogensehnen
Pfeilgeschosse gehen nieder
Abgefeuert von halbgekleideten, gewaltbereiten, eingeborenen Kriegern
Ey yo, in äußerster Not fang' ich 'nen Pfeil aus der Luft
Dreh' ihn um, werf' zurück und der Häuptling ist tot
Sie ziehen sich zurück in verstecke Pfade und Gänge
Es bleiben barbarische Klänge, Schamanengesänge
Und auf einmal setzen sich die Knochen zusammen
Erheben sich, leere Augenhöhlen glotzen uns an
Ein Skelett kommt an, ich nehm sein Kopf in die Hand
Hol aus und schlag mit ihm ein motherfucking Loch in die Wand
Yeah, und wir schlagen uns durch die Armee der Knochengerippe
Ich verteil lockere Tritte oder box sie in Stücke
Dann noch ein paar Schritte und wir sind raus aus der Hölle
Und drinnen in einem weiteren, verstaubten Gewölbe
Wo auf 'nem Goldaltar das Ziel unserer Reise steht
Sich von nem tiefroten Energiestrom umkreist erhebt
Ein Tomahawk mit pulsierend glühender Inschrift
Ich greif durch den Energiekreis, berühre das Ding mit
Beiden Händen und irgendetwas explodiert
Irgendetwas detoniert, wir müssen weg von hier
Schmutzige Wassermassen durchströmen die Gänge
Ich seh hoch, irgendwo hat diese Höhle ein Ende
Nehm die Armbrust, schieß ein Seil mit Widerhaken rauf
Und wir klettern beide hoch und ziehen uns daran raus von hier
Dort oben ist 'ne Öffnung, ich hab 's Licht schon gesehen
Kletter weiter, Griff des Tomahawks zwischen den Zähnen

Auf der Spitze der Pyramide wie die Illuminaten
Gegner wie depressive Volksgruppen niedergeschlagen
Hier opferten sie einst Göttern mit schwierigen Namen
In diesen heutigen Tagen vermag sie niemand zu sagen
Wie wir hier so stehen, ist deshalb ein Bild für die Götter
Alter und neue befüllen sie Magazine und Köcher
Über dem Dschungel kreisen Schwärme von Raubvögeln
Während sich rotleuchtende Augen aus diesen Schatten herauslösen
Am Horizont kommen Killer, die wollen uns auch töten
Ich kann die Namen all meiner Feinde schon im Rauch lesen
Doch so ist das Leben an der Spitze als Kings
Alle wollen dich brechen wie die Spitze von der Nase der Sphynx
Ein majestätisches Farbenspiel, jetzt wo die Nacht naht
Eigentlich kann man sterben, wenn man all diese Pracht sah
Lage sieht schwierig aus, Luft wird schiefergrau
Doch wir rauchen noch in Ruhe unsere Cohibas auf
Umhüllt von den letzten Schwaden von ihrem Rauch
Zieht uns ein Kabel vom schwarzen Heli wieder rauf
Und so schweben wir weg, elegant, wie wir kamen
Richtung bildschöner Damen bekannt von Leinwand und Dramen
Ihren Namen auf internatioalen Filmplakaten
So leben die Kings in diesen Tagen, Bitch

Du denkst, das ist Rap aus dem Amerika der 90er
Nas hätte umsonst gefeatured, wenn er in Europa wär
E hätte umsonst gefeatured, wenn er noch am Leben wär
Mir ist das egal, die hätten mich hier sowieso genervt
Ich mach diese paar Songs nur weil die SDK mich lenkt
Und ich nicht musikalisch bin, sonst hätte ich ne Punkrock Band
Mit skandalösen Alben in den Charts Top 10
Und nen Schrottvan voller Mösen
Mit denen ich an einer Nadel häng'
Ich rede keinen Straßenslang, die Straße redet bald wie ich
Ist erst dieser Song released, malen sich Banger mein Gesicht
In Farbe auf die Oberarme oder gleich in die Visage
Jonarama und Prinz Porno halten deine Welt in Atem
Halten dicht, verraten nichts, was die SDK betrifft
Nichtmal unter Folter, oder vor dem Strafgericht
Ihr wollt mir das Wasser reichen, bitte mit Limettenscheibchen
Ich lasse mich treiben und geh' sauber raus wie Wasserleichen

Und bleibe unten wie verletzte Taucher
Du machst Mukke für den Ballermann
Ich guck' mir mal wieder Colours(?) an
Mach vorm Studio Mukke mit dem Ballermann
Bis die Nachbarn Gott rufen, dann nach den Cops rufen
Rapper kleben manchmal an der Straße so wie Kotzspuren

Ich bin blau, du schiebst Blues
Deine Frau kriegt nie genug
Deshalb hängt sie schon wieder hier
Nackt bei mir, in der Booth
Meine Crews, 333SDK, KLR
Deine Crew nicht dabei?
Sag nochmal. Nie gehört!
Ich werde von Gott gehört
Er spielt mich auf seinem Leierkasten
Ultra laut, immer dann
Wenn ich mir an die Eier fasse
Und dein neues Making Of
Vollgestopft mit fakem Schrott
Ist dank dir und deinem Team
Nur ein Behindi the scenes

Ich war 2006 iced-out mit Cap
Dein Kackgesicht wird jetzt kurz ins Scheißhaus gesteckt
Dein Weib braucht Respekt, es geht gleich rauf aufs Bett
Und ich ficke die Schlampe solange durch
Bis ihr Kreislauf verreckt
Und wenn ich nicht der Beste bin, wer dann?
Ich komm mit Messern in der Hand und schreie
""Rette sich wer kann!"", der Nette von nebenan
Mit Kettensägen im Schrank hält fette Mädchen geknebelt
Im Gästezimmer gefangen, im Kopf Fragen
""Fick ich sie, fick ich sie nicht?"" Vielleicht spritz ich
Der Bitch in ihr Pickelgesicht
Ich pack' in meine Parts Frust-Fun Fickgeschichten
Lass vor Tour jetzt schon mit Teflon mein' Dick beschichten
Nochmal Schwein gehabt, wie Muslime die nur Modemäßig
Gläubig sind, für einen Tag, einen lan!
Ich hab keinen Plan warum sie grade wie Bitches flow'n
Ich war nie weg, ich war nur paar Jahre Kippen holen

Also acht lange Jahre tiefster Untergrund - chillig
Wie eine Wand wo keiner ahnt dass darunter ein Bild ist
Ohne ein Lebenszeichen, ein Mysterium bleiben
Die Texte mit Dampf in den Nebel schreiben
Aluminiumfolie mit Klebestreifen
Befestigen, 24 Stunden tragen
Damit die feindlichen Strahlen nicht in den Schädel treiben
Ich fake'e meinen Tod und ich säe Beweise
Für den NSA, die CIA und MeinRap.de
Ja ich weiß, früher da war alles viel besser
Mads Mikkelsen war damals noch nicht Hannibal Lecter
Jeder Rapper, der nicht erstens aus Berlin war
Zweitens in meinem Team war
Oder drittens Westberlin Maskulin war

Prinz Porno,"Ich hab' geträumt, ich wär' gestorben
Und stand in meinem Fahrstuhl, fand' das sehr in Ordnung
Denn es lief mein Lieblingslied und es ging nach oben
Wie der Kontostand von meinem Psychologen
Und die Tür geht auf, ich lauf' auf Wolken
Lange Schlange an der goldenen Pforte, 
ich geh' an allen vorbei, mit folgenden Worten:
Gästeliste plus zwei
Und einen goldenen Schuss hab' ich noch frei
Petrus nickt, sagt „Wir haben gewartet
Dass du kommst Kumpel, doch jetzt bist du da und die Party startet“
Und in den Wolken steht es kaligraphisch
Kurt, Biggie, Pac, Jimmie, John, schön, dass jetzt alle da sind
Nachts stehen wir angetrunken an Rändern von Wolken
Pissen runter, auf das Pentagon
Unten gibt es nur Intrigen, Sinnkrisen, Zweckkriege
Arme Menschen, die die reichen von sich weg schieben
Wir kennen das schon

Ich liege nachts im Bett und jeder von den Spasten rappt
Unzählige Alben voll mit krassem Dreck
Ich weiß die Zeilen hier sind ungewohnt einfach, aber es passt perfekt
Ihr seid alle wack

Ich liege nachts im Bett und jeder von den Spasten rappt
Unzählige Alben voll mit krassem Dreck
Ich weiß die Zeilen hier sind ungewohnt einfach, aber es passt perfekt
Ihr seid alle wack

Von oben da ist alles leichter, wirken Probleme kleiner
Und wenn man tot ist, dann scheißt man auf alle seine Lebensgeister
Ein kleines Stück von Bitterkeit schwingt mit in jeder Weisheit
Weil man sie nicht befolgt, während die eigene Zeit vorbei treibt
Denke ich, während ich Jesus high five
Hier im Himmel sind nur Stars, es ist ein crazy Nightlife
Doch unter uns, es ist doch langweilig
Wenn man nicht mehr sterben kann
Geht man mit seinem Körper schlechter um
Ich führe lange Selbstgespräche über die Berechtigung
Der Spezies von diesen Whack MCs
Während von unten irgendein Künstler durch die Decke schießt
Und sich zwei Jahre später selbst mit einer Überdosis
In einen der Pophimmel zwei Etagen über Bro'Sis
So mäandert meine Logik über Gleichnisse
Durchstreift Riffe von Argumenten so wie Haifische
Bis ich zu dem Schluss komme, man darf da nicht weich werden
Auch Dampf wird zu Tropfen, die im Himmel dann zu Eis werden
Man darf da nicht niemals weich werden
Auch Dampf wird zu Tropfen, die im Himmel dann zu Eis werden

Prinz Porno,"Die Steine meiner Stadt haben keine Augen oder Ohren
Unterscheiden keine Tage oder Nacht
Doch mit unser'n Leben, unser'n Kriegen
Den Verlusten und den Siegen
Unser'n schwindenden Familien, schleifen wir sie ab
Der Boden der Moschee spürt den Teppich und die Gläubigen
Die Sonne wärmt die Platten vor dem Dom, die noch heute sind
Wo man sie eins niederlegte, als in der Stadt noch Kutschen fuhren
Bevor durch sie zwei Kriege fegten
Sie werden liebkost von Herbstsonne und Nieselregen
Speichern Anekdoten, die sie nie erzählen
Die Mauern, in die Knastinsassen, Schwüre oder Hasstiraden
Oder ihre Namen schreiben, fang' manchmal an fast zu atmen
In Nächten wo der Mond glüht
Es unmöglich ist zu unterscheiden zwischen Träumen und wachen Phasen
Die Brücke überrollt von Autoscharen
Während Menschen die keiner sieht, unter ihnen traumlos schlafen

Wir fragen uns, ist da wer, oder sind wir nur alleine
Irgendwann werden wir Fossilien, Spur der Steine
Fels wird Sand, das Element bleibt nur pur im Kleinen
Wir sehen zu und treiben auf der Spur der Steine

Der eine Stein vom Mariannenplatz hat es am ersten Mai
Hoch in eine Hand geschafft, die ihn dann mit ganzer Kraft
Schleudert bis er an die blecherne Wand einer Wanne kracht
Er zu Boden taumelt, neben schwarzen Stiefeln niedersteigt
Bis man ihn wieder greift, wieder schmeisst
Bis er endlich liegenbleibt
Im Wiederschein von brennenden Reifen, noch ein Laster
Wäscht mit Hochdruck Wasser über's Kopfsteinpflaster
Wo sich die Steine aneinanderschmiegen
Als Symbol für die Stadtbewohner, die mal auseinanderziehen
Sich woanders neu zusammenfügen, in Ehen, WGen und Altersheimen
Kinder werden geboren und die Greise sterben
Während die Steine immer starr in ihrer Haltung bleiben
Und nur widerwillig kleine Spuren von Alter zeigen

Wir fragen uns, ist da wer, oder sind wir nur alleine
Irgendwann werden wir Fossilien, Spur der Steine
Fels wird Sand, das Element bleibt nur pur im Kleinen
Wir sehen zu und treiben auf der Spur der Steine

Die Grabsteine warten mit den Toten auf die Ewigkeit
Variabel in den Daten ihrer Lebenszeit
Gleich in der Akustik, weil hier jeder schweigt
Nebel steigt nicht höher als Büsche hier, der Zähler zeigt
Andere Werte in der Körpergröße, Kontostand, Kinderanzahl
Manche ungekleidet, in Seiden- oder Wintermantel
Neben- und hintereinander in Kisten aus Fichten oder Buchen
Während die Wurzeln der Bäume die toten Brüder suchen
Sie sich vereinigen im steinigen Erdreich
Bedeckt von Kies, den einst ein Meer vor sich hertreibt
Vieles ist Unterschied, doch es bleibt mehr gleich
Denn jeden den es hierhin hinunterzieht, wollte mehr Zeit
Zähflüssiger Teer schweißt die Pflastersteine eben
Wie Sägespäne Blut in der Manege eines Zirkuszeltes
Bedecken sie nur Dramen und Probleme
Auch aus härtesten Granitbrocken werden am Ende Wege

Wir fragen uns, ist da wer, oder sind wir nur alleine
Irgendwann werden wir Fossilien, Spur der Steine
Fels wird Sand, das Element bleibt nur pur im Kleinen
Wir sehen zu und treiben auf der Spur der Steine

Prinz Porno,"Ich kann meine Sicht der Dinge gern' erklären
Eltern haben nie Zeit und so werden wir erzogen von den Fernsehserien
Und ihren Charakteren
Die auf uns abfärben, bis wir selber welche werden
Seit jeher streben Menschen nach in Form'n gepresst'n seltnen Erzen
Moralische Werte gleichen langsam schmelzenden Kerzen
Irgendwann sind sie amorphe Massen Wachs
Du liebst nur dann, wenn du auch was zu hassen hast
Deine ganze Last nahmen dir die Priester ab, heute die Therapeuten
In Zeiten von Wikileaks lässt sich alles schwerer leugnen
Doch es geht noch
Und so tragen die größten Verbrecher Maßanzüge oder Uniformen
Der neue Jesus ist noch ungeboren, doch meine Freundin schwanger
Nichts hat sich geändert, ich bin nur etwas bekannter
In der Welt der Marken, hat alles Rang und Namen
Darum wandte ich mich ab und hörte auf den Klang der Farben ?

Sie sagen „Oh oh, ein Mörder, von dem man gehört hat
Der tötet Rapper mit Wörtern, hat im Keller die Körper
Oh oh, ein Mörder! Oh oh, ein Mörder!
Schnell weg mit dem Curser, wenn er das mal nicht gehört hat“

Philosophen und Computerspiele haben mich verändert
Ich bin eine Spielfigur und stoße gegen die Ränder
Des Bildschirms meiner Realität
Das ist eines meiner Gleichnisse, dass jeder versteht
Die anderen sind schwieriger
Die Welt ist ein Konzept, das wir formen mit Gedanken
Wir tragen Komplexe mit uns, wie ein Ranzen
Und müssen ihn loswerden - verlernen, was wir lernten
Denn wir kamen aus der Ferne von den Sternen
Ich hänge bei der NASA ab, sie sagen ich wär' Überking
Doch seit Kubrick's Film vom Mond weiß ich, dass sie Lügner sind
Will nur die Schlüssel für die Raumstation und Jetpack
Chaos im Kopf gebändigt von einem Yankee Snapback in dunkelblau
Ich gebe einen Fick auf nichts und niemand
Seit zwei Jahren produzieren sie mich in China
Meine Klone sehen aus wie ich, nur riechen metallisch
Ihre Quelle der Gewalt ist auch die Wurzel eures Neides

Sie sagen „Oh oh, ein Mörder, von dem man gehört hat

Prinz Porno,"Auch wenn der Beat zwar versöhnlich ist, dann nur die Töne, Bitch
Der Inhalt dieses Liedes ist nix schöneres
Als der Instinkt eines Löwen ist
Befehle an die Pfoten, immer 
Wenn eine Gruppe Antilopen auf der nächsten Anhöhe sich
Kurz ausruht, bevor das alte Raubtier sie packt
Denn wie wir alle ist es im Töten Autodidakt
Mit dem metallenen Geschmack von Blut, geht es auf in die Nacht
Zwischen den Zeilen lesend, sehe ich weisse Linien
Alles wird zu Staub und sie ziehen ihn
Bis sie an der Spitze eines Stiefels enden, wie Sizilien
Mein Song ist wie Fußball, die Kids spielen ihn

Es könnte in diesem Song um Freiheit gehen
Oder um ein anderes tiefsinniges Thema
Doch ich führ' dich in die Irre wie das Wort „Weisheitszene“
Lass uns lieber mal das Mic einpegeln

Du denkst Rap ist Kunst? Die wäre abstrakt
Das wäre doch leicht, hier ist alles erlaubt
Bin ich fertig mit Nummer 2, wird das restliche Haus
Eingerissen und um mein Produkt ein Museum gebaut
Tickets verkauft, Kataloge gedruckt
Laudatios auf diese Großtat geschrieben
Ich fing an als der Beste, year, fresh wie Will Smith
Als der Prinz of Bel Air, nur ich bin es geblieben
P zu dem gottverdammten O, mein gut abgehangener Flow
Ändert nichts an dem Fakt, dass deine stadtbekannte Hoe
Dick suckt und wie meine Kritiker bemerken werden, das war nur ein Zweckreim
Doch damit wird der 16er geschlossen, 
Wie die Mauer von einem Eckstein

Ich hab' hier eine neue Idee für den Refrain
Wir machen das, wie bei diesem anderen Song „Parfum“
Einfach mal was freilassen im Sinne der Kunst
Multiple Persönlichkeiten stimmen für uns

Ah, ich war Verschwörungstheoretiker
Durch meine Songs tätiger Prediger des neuesten Testaments
Prophezeite, was der Rest erkennt, erst wenn der Westen brennt
Und man das letzte Hemd als weisse Fahne hisst
Ich könnte Quellen angeben, aber euch sagen diese Namen nichts, bis es Panik gibt
Ich machte Praktika bei Rothschild, nach Treffen von den Bilderbergern
Ließen sie mich morgens ihre Spuren aus der Villa kärchern
Auf hoher See - treibt das Flaggschiff in die Minen
Wird sich wer spiegeln in dem Lack von Limousinen
Sonne brennt auf matte Pick-Up Trucks
Wo die RPG im Himmel über Kurdistan die MIG erfasst
Und die Kalash ist nicht Schild und Schwert
Sondern Pixel für den Berg, der die Bilder nährt

Quien te encenderá? 

Seré yo, seré yo, seré yo, seré yo 
Estaré ahí para compartir por siempre

Te necesitaré ahora y siempre 
Detente, porque yo realmente te amo

Priscilla Ahn,"I was a little girl alone in my little world
Who dreamed of a little home for me
I played pretend between the trees
And fed my house guests bark and leaves
And laughed in my pretty bed of green

I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest swing
I had a dream

Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park
I asked God who I'm supposed to be
The stars smiled down on me
God answered in silent reverie
I said a prayer and fell asleep

I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest tree

The birds and the bees only know which way to fly

Your mouth is a trumpet, somebody else plays
Long after the notes gone, the tone usually stays

And your chest a fine pillow, with lining of feather
Your hair is a family, with strands stick together
Fingers are keys from the grandest piano, played by a line that the Lord only knew

A tongue of an angel, floats in red wine saliva
Your teeth ravel porcelain, made by masters in China
Your face can't be captured by pictures or words
And your voice is a music that I've never heard

Priscilla Herdman,"It's fifty long springtimes since she was a bride,
But still you may see her at each Whitsuntide
In a dress of white linen with ribbons of green,
As green as her memories of loving.

The feet that were nimble tread carefully now,
As gentle a measure as age will allow,
Through groves of white blossoms, by fields of young corn, 
Where once she was pledged to her true love.

The fields they stand empty, the hedges grow free--
No young men to turn them, our pastures go seed
They are gone where the forests of oak trees before
Have gone, to be wasted in battle.

Down from the green farmlands and from their loved ones
Marched husbands and brothers and fathers and sons.
There's a fine roll of honor where the Maypole once stood, 
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

There's a straight row of houses in these latter days 
All covering the downs where the sheep used to graze. 
There's a field of red poppies, a wreath from the Queen 
But the ladies remember at Whitsun, 
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun. ",Dancing at Whitsun,1977
Priscilla Herdman,"An hour before the sun goes down 
Behind the ragged boughs, 
I go across the little run 
And bring the dusty cows; 
And once I used to sit and rest 
Beneath the fading dome, 
For there was one that I loved best 
Who'd bring the cattle home. 

Our yard is fixed with double bails, 
Round one the grass is green, 
The bush is growing through the rails, 
The spike is rusted in; 
And 'twas from there his freckled face 
Would turn and smile at me -- 
He'd milk a dozen in the race 
While I was milking three. 

I milk eleven cows myself 
Where once I milked but four; 
I set the dishes on the shelf 
And close the dairy door; 
And when the glaring sunlight fails 
And the fire shines through the cracks, 
I climb the broken stockyard rails 
And watch the bridle-tracks. 

He kissed me twice and once again 
And rode across the hill, 
The pint-pots and the hobble-chain 
I hear them jingling still; 
He'll come at night or not at all -- 
He left in dust and heat, 
And when the soft, cool shadows fall 
Is the best time to meet. 

And he is coming back again, 
He wrote to let me know, 
The floods were in the Darling then -- 
It seems so long ago; 
He'd come through miles of slush and mud, 
And it was weary work, 
The creeks were bankers, and the flood 
Was forty miles round Bourke. 

He said the floods had formed a block, 
The plains could not be crossed, 
And there was foot-rot in the flock 
And hundreds had been lost; 
The sheep were falling thick and fast 
A hundred miles from town, 
And when he reached the line at last 
He trucked the remnant down. 

And so he'll have to stand the cost; 
His luck was always bad, 
Instead of making more, he lost 
The money that he had; 
And how he'll manage, heaven knows 
(My eyes are getting dim), 
He says -- he says -- he don't -- suppose 
I'll want -- to -- marry -- him. 

As if I wouldn't take his hand 
Without a golden glove -- 
Oh! Jack, you men won't understand 
How much a girl can love. 
I long to see his face once more -- 
Jack's dog! thank God, it's Jack! -- 
(I never thought I'd faint before) 
He's coming -- up -- the track.

Priscilla Herdman,"When you've come to make your fortune, and you haven't made your salt, 
And the reason of your failure isn't anybody's fault-
When you haven't got a billet, and the times are very slack, 
There is nothing that can spur you like the shame of going back; 
Chorus: 
Crawling home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of ""humiliation's cup"". 

When the place and you are strangers and you struggle all alone, 
And you have a mighty longing for the town where you are known; 
When your clothes are very shabby, and the future's very black, 
There is nothing that can hurt you like the shame of going back
Going home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of ""humiliation's cup"". 

When we've fought the battle bravely and are beaten to the wall, 
'Tis the sneer of man, not conscience, that makes cowards of us all; 
And while you are returning, oh! your brain is on the rack, 
And your heart is in the shadow of the shame of going back. 

When a beaten man's discovered with a bullet in his brain, 
They post-mortem him, and try him, and they say he was insane; 
But it very often happens that he'd lately got the sack, 
And his onward move was owing to the shame of going back.
Going home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of ""humiliation's cup"". 

Ah! my friend, you call it nonsense, and your upper lip is curled-- 
You have had no real trouble in your passage through the world; 
But when fortune rounds upon you and the rain is on the track, 
You will learn the bitter meaning of the shame of going back; 
Going home with empty pockets, Going back hard-up; 
Oh! it's then you taste the poison in ""humiliation's cup"".

Priscilla Herdman,"Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with he's up and split, the chair next to you's free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you

Priscilla Herdman,"I bid farewell to the state of old New York
My home away from home
In the state of New York I came of age
When first I started roaming
And the trees grow high in New York State
And they shine like gold in the autumn
Never had the blues from whence I came
But in New York State I got 'em

Talk to me of Mendocino
Closing my eyes I hear the sea
Must I wait
Must I follow
Won't you say come with me

And it's on to South Bend, Indiana
Flat out on the western plain
Rise up over the Rockies 
And down on into California
Out to where but the rocks again
And let the sun set on the ocean
I will watch it from the shore
Let the sun rise over the redwoods
I'll rise with it till I rise no more

Priscilla Herdman,"I look at my brown suitcase
And think of all the places that I've been,
Railroad yards and prison guards,
All the dumpy little towns along the stem
And the whispering of the people
As they watch every move that I go through;
I remember all those things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

cho: I remember loving you,
Back when the world was new,
And I think you loved me too,
I remember loving you,

The buckskin smells so the people tell
As we huddled in the boxcar from the rain;
Flashing lights that cut the night,
The railroad bull that pulled us off the train,
When the winter's cold and the Norther blows
I'm huddled in the corner 'til I'm blue;
I remember all these things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

Winter streets where the frozen sleet
Comes soaking through the cardboard in my shoes,
Where the promised land might be a place
Where a man could find free cigarettes and booze,
And the alleyways full of ragged strays,
The doorway wine I tell my troubles to,
I remember all these things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

",I Remember Loving You,1987
Priscilla Herdman,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows",And So It Goes,1995
Priscilla Herdman,"The sun is sinking low in the sky above Ashokan. 
The pines and the willows know soon we will part. 
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken, 
And a love that will always remain in my heart. 

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter, 
The magic of moving as one, 
And a time we'll remember long ever after 
The moonlight and music and dancing are done. 

Will we climb the hills once more? 
Will we walk the woods together? 
Will I feel you holding me close once again? 
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever? 
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then? 

Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping 
Over the lake the stars shine. 
They wonder if you and I will be keeping 
The magic and music, or leave them behind.

Priscilla Herdman,"The water is wide I can not get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two
And both shall row my love and I

Where love is planted O there it grows
It grows and blossoms like a rose
It has a sweet and pleasant smell
No flower on Earth can it excel

A ship there is and she sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

O love is handsome and love is fine
And love's a jewel while it is new
But when it is old it grows so cold
And fades away like morning dew ",The Water Is Wide,1995

Please pump the brakes, don't speed

Ain't no need to try to rush

Why don't we map out the way?

Priscilla Renea,"I'm just a girl, you're just a boy
This is my heart, it's not a toy
So what's with you playing with my mind
We used to be cool, this used to be love
Now it's become, something like a job
Like it or not, maybe things were changing right before our eyes

I tried to be a picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

Cause I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be, puttin' me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be, stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls, cause I ain't a doll

You call the shots, right down to my shoes
I liked what you liked cause you told me to
And I don't think that you could even tell
I fell out of love, but it never showed
I gave up on us so long ago
But you'll never know
Baby don't pretend like you know me so well

I tried to be a picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Try to control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be, puttin' me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be, stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls, cause I ain't a doll

I'll never be made of plastic
So glad that my heart's elastic
No matter what you do
I'll bounce back offa you
Cut me but I'm not bleeding

I tried to be a picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna to control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be, puttin' me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No I could never be, stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls, I ain't a doll

And I come with imperfections

Then you're no good for me, so glad I kept my receipt",Dollhouse,2009

You understand me like no one else does
You love me perfect, that's more than enough
I can't find a flaw in you, not even one
I know you'll be here, in the long run.
You know the reason I'm so insecure.
And day after day you convince me I'm wrong.
Telling me beauty is neither here or there.
But you understand why I'm fixing my hair

[Chorus]
Cause I'm fixing my hair for you
I want to be beautiful
Even when you tell me I'm so pretty,
I need it to hide all my insecurities.
And I'm fixing my hair for you
Just like you like me to
Even when you tell me that you couldn't care less
I'm always fixing my hair
(I'm always fixing, fixing my hair)

Hours in the mirror for nothing at all
Staring at my imaginary flaws (imaginary flaws)
Making excuses to fix what ain't broke
You make me feel better like only you know, how
Why are we where we are
Someone like me, how did we get this far.
When we get older when you're still around
When all of my hair has fallen on the ground

[Chorus]

Please believe me when I say
I don't mean to be so vain
But I've got issues within
What you see when you're with me
Is something I can never be
You gotta understand
All you ever knew was the pretty girl,
The funny girl, the girl with no worries or cares.
But I've got a lot that I'm hiding inside
That's why I'm fixing my hair.

And weep by the willows

And take a picture in your favorites dress
To lay in beside your permanent bed 
To re pleas the one whose been blown with the wind

The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a smoke break
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doing
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription
You got an addiction
Who do you think that you're fooling

John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh

Errybody's addicted to something
Errybody gotta grip onto something
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
That people that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence, you say you've been at the gym
But the way look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hiding?

Yeah, I've probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro(I mean)
Had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up wit' me cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!""
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different
I love all the money, the fame
And the parties with beautiful women
I spend so much time as an underground artist
'Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn when they pivot
And change you perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Everything possible
When I told 'em my dreams, they just said they ain't logical
Now, I can see it, it's optical (optical)

Pissin off the powers that be

Led a life of death and destruction
Bet you'd like to see me die
A big nabd without interruption
Blood lust is satisfied

So what's the meaning of life?
And what do you suggest that I do with mine?
I'd like to get the whole world off of my chest
What's that look in your eyes?

I can tell when thing's ain't straight
Another voice inside me dies replaced with another fueled by hate and I hate all your lies
Look me straight in my eyes
I've done my time

Melt away the bars from this cell
It kinda makes you hard and cold
Life sucks in this private hell
It's not a place for you to grow old

This just a taste of tomorrow with the same ol' shit each day
Gotta lie, cheat, steal, or borrow
It's the good old fashioned way
So what the fuck do you want?

What the fuck do you need?
An invitation to hell on earth has been sent to you with a VIP
But like a dog on a leash, restrained from a vicious attack
I'll try to fuck you twice as hard as you plunge a grudge knife in my back

And I hate all your lies
Look me straight in my eyes
I've done my time",The Prisoner,2005
Pro-Pain,"Torn and ripped apart at the seams
I guess I took too much for the team
Had a knack for keepin' the score
But I can't put my thoughts into words anymore
I never reaped rewards from the masses
I stood tall and beat some asses
Accolades were far and few
I did it all not for me, but for you, and I'm torn!
Torn to pieces with every turn
I'm torn to pieces
Torn and lost in the game
It's like being left in the rain
Guess it's best to know when to quit
Well now you know that this could be it
Faceless in a redundant scene for dead ears and for silent screams
Where the cream don't rise to the top and too much talkin' shit/talking shop
And I'm torn
Torn to pieces with every turn
I'm torn to pieces",Torn,2005

To that pool inside the forest in whose waters I shall drown

Caprice, your bugle blew away the cobwebs from my ears

I sat me down to write a simple story
Which maybe in the end became a song
In trying to find the words which might begin it
I found these were the thoughts I brought along

At first I took my weight to be an anchor
And gathered up my fears to guide me round
But then I clearly saw my own delusion
And found my struggles further bogged me down

In starting out I thought to go exploring
And set my foot upon the nearest road
In vain I looked to find the promised turning
But only saw how far I was from home

In searching I forsook the paths of learning
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me
And still no hidden truths could I unfold

I sat me down to write a simple story
Which maybe in the end became a song
The words have all been writ by one before me
We're taking turns in trying to pass them on
Oh, we're taking turns in trying to pass them on

So I bought a pair of wings, went up upon a wall 
I was about to jump into the air when a guy from the street called 
He said, 'Hey wait a minute! Don't you realize the danger? 
What do you think you are, some kind of angel?' 

I considered for a minute, realized he spoke the truth. 
For the barbells on my eyelids only emphasized my youth 
And the sawdust in my plimsolls means the same to him as me 
But that's neither here nor further, so I spoke considerately 
Now if you understand just what I'm trying to say, 
Whatever you do, don't grin, you'll give the game away!'

In the anger of the moment I had diced with death and lost 
It seemed to me the time was right so I burst into song

You know you robbed me of my sight, and light is what I fear
I tell you that I can not see but you persist in showing me
Those bangles that I paid for long ago




And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so
Your skin crawls up an octave, your teeth have lost their gleam
The peaches snuggle closer down into the clotted cream
And for some unknown reason my watch begins to chime
And though I beg and plead with you, you tell me it's not time




And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so
The sun seeps through the window to see if we're still dead
To try to throw some light upon the gloom around our bed
At quarter past the doorbell rings, the water faucet drips and sings

Angels mumbled incantations, closely watched by God on high 

Lightning struck out - fire and brimstone! Boiling oil and shrieking steam! 
Darkness struck with molten fury, flashbulbs glorified the scene 
Not a man who had a finger, not a man who could be seen 
Nothing called (not name nor number) - Echo stormed its final scream

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the lighted chandelier
Stands a rusty old retainer
Whose old eyes are filled with tears
For his master, good sir galant,
Who is now off to the wars
And although his eyes are crying
We know grief is not the cause
And if grief is not the reason
He must be of sterner stuff
And his sword though old and rusty
Must be blunt as sharp enough

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the broken window pane
Stand the remnants of the evening
Who are waiting all in vain
For the crowing of the cockerel
Showing morning is not night
But the air is filled with silence
And the daylight is not bright
But still darkness is no reason
We are men of sterner stuff
And our swords though old and rusty
Still are blunt as sharp enough.

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the hat-stand in the hall
Waiting only for the morning
Shadows flitting 'cross the wall
And perhaps that old retainer
Whom now giving of his all
May have once been just as we are
And now has no face at all.
But still grief was not the reason
He was made of sterner stuff
And his sword though old and rusty
Still was blunt as sharp enough.

Everybody crazy as a coon
I'm running round in my underpants
Trying to find some kinda romance

Quarter past three [sic] on lime street
I got whipped right offa my feet
Didn't realize that I'd been caught
Till I found myself in the county court

'mr judge,' I said, 'won't you please be kind
Have pity on me, a poor orphan child? '
Mr judge he says with a long mean frown
'orphan or not, you're going down!'

Well I screamed on my knees in the witness box,
'lord have mercy on my golden locks.'
The judge I could see that he was snide
He says, 'the only kind of blonde you are's a peroxide!'

He's got a pet black tabby cat
That carries a gun and wears a stetson hat

The door flies open, in strides geek
Looking like the front page of newsweek
He says to lou in a voice of glee,
'what's the matter, ain't you glad to see me? '
Lou's on the floor 'cause he can't stand up
As green as a leaf in a tea-cup
When on to geek's back jumps a stetson-hatted cat

Light the way for the savior?s son 
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city down",About to Die [Mono Version],2002
Procol Harum,"This war we are waging is already lost
The cause for the fighting has long been a ghost
Malice and habit have now won the day
The honours we fought for are lost in the fray

Standards and bugles are trod in the dust
Wounds have burst open, and corridors rust
Once proud and truthful, now humbled and bent
Fires which burnt brightly, now energies spent

Let down the curtain, and exit the play
The crowds have gone home and the cast sailed away
Our flowers and feathers as scarring as weapons
Our poems and letters have turned to deceptions
",Fires (Which Burnt Brightly) [Stereo],2002
Procol Harum,"Tell you how the story stands
I'm a victim in your hands
Got me pleading on my bended knees
That's the way the picture reads
It's a horror show
It's a body blow
And it's gone too far

Tell me a reason
Well give me a sign
Somebody somewhere
Throw me a line
Somebody down there
Looking for blood
Off with the horses
Into the flood

Now you've made a big mistake
Spoiled the icing on the wedding cake
Killed the goose that laid the golden egg
This time babe you're going to have to beg
It's a crying shame
It's a dying flame
And it's gone too far

Tell me a reason
Give me a sign
Somebody somewhere
Throw me a line
Somebody down there
Looking for blood
Off with the horses
Yeah, into the flood

So you pulled the perfect crime
Turned the water into wine

Got me on my bended knees
Now's the time to make me squeeze

Came in from the freezing cold
Turned the glitter into gold (from the barbican)

It's a bloody mess
It's a body-blow
And it's gone too far",Into the Flood [Stereo],2002
Procol Harum,"Your convent-cloistered, cluttered mind
[calls] out for me but I'm behind
You cannot see into your room
Whose perfumed depths sing songs of doom

But I am cold and cannot see
A way out of this mystery

Wild horses couldn't change your mind
Or help you up and let you find
That I am here cold or blind
That I have something left to find

But I am cold and cannot see
A way out of your mystery

An ali baba you would be
In search of treasure endlessly
And like some jewel you'ld comfort me
And in your showcase I would be

But I am cold and cannot see
A way out of your mystery
",So Far Behind,2003
Procol Harum,"I sat me down to write a simple story 
Which maybe in the end became a song 
In trying to find the words which might begin it 
I found these were the thoughts I brought along 

At first I took my weight to be an anchor 
And gathered up my fears to guide me round 
But then I clearly saw my own delusion 
And found my struggles further bogged me down 

In starting out I thought to go exploring 
And set my foot upon the nearest road 
In vain I looked to find the promised turning 
But only saw how far I was from home 

In searching I forsook the paths of learning 
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold 
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me 
And still no hidden truths could I unfold 

I sat me down to write a simple story 
Which maybe in the end became a song 
The words have all been writ by one before me 
We're taking turns in trying to pass them on 
Oh, we're taking turns in trying to pass them on",Pilgrim's Progress,2005
Procol Harum,"Each man has a soul
That struggles to escape
And in the shallows of his dreams
We can often see its wake

For we all have our secrets
That we all keep deep inside
Away from light, in darkest night
Where it's always safe to hide

Away from all that we should meet
Less someone else should share
That thing that hides inside our soul
That we pray was never there

And out upon that ocean
A lifetime from the shore
Miguel stood his night watch
Recalling everything he saw

For he was a deckhand
Aboard the ""maersk dubai""
He had sailed her round the world
From hamburg to sendai

But this trip had been different
More than any he had known
For on board there was an evil
And the evil had been shown

For halfway through this voyage
They had found two stowaways
That the captain had thrown in the sea
And left them to the waves

And when he tried to close his eyes
And pretend he did not know
The evil did not go away
But used the time to grow

For later on that same trip
They found a stowaway once again
But the captain soon met this one too
And brought him to the same cold end

He wondered what that boy thought inside
Before that final sleep
When water was all that was around
And his lungs had screamed breathe deep

He wondered what went through his mind
As he gasped for air
And the last moment when he prayed for help
To find nobody there

He wondered to himself
If he could have been the one
To stand up at that moment

And say this cannot be done
To stand up to the captain
And say this thing it cannot be
But there is nothing closer to god on earth
Than a captain on the sea

And he was just a deckhand
With no right to plead the case
Of this stranger in their midst
And so he kept his place

And what is done is done
And undone cannot be
And so he pushed it from his mind

And stared out across the sea",Underture,2013
ProCrazz,"Past the rapping the similes all these metaphors punchlines 
Fancy flows rhyming double time 
With a humble mind 
I get my ego and attitude from my homies and various competition that tend brag when I stumble flying 
I'm still a newbie 
I started with on shuffle 
Burning various calories now I'm coming off the muscle 
In 2012 I built a studio inside these walls
Closing the gap and burning bridge I walk across 
They call me selfish cause I always do what's best for me 
Cooking in the studio you know I got the recipe 
But I lose sight of my identity 
I never feel like me 
But that's a dynamic of character you'll never see 
I'm only human I've made plenty mistakes 
Regretful for all my sins doing everything it takes 
to repent 
But still I feel these flows are heaven sent 
Try my hardest just to move curse these shoes they were made in cement 
Im always so hard myself 
Expecting more than I can give or get from someone else
I used to be happy go lucky 
Feeling like no one can touch me 
They rush me 
They claim they love me 
That I've never felt 
I'm tryna go back to them days 
Where I played video games 
And wasn't concerned with general pop knowing my name 
Looking straight in the mirror it's rare that I feel the same 
Im driving myself insane lost my mind just gain 
I keep my feelings locked away inside my notebook 
Back when it was all raps and no hooks 
Back when I would tell a story that would leave your soul shook
Back when all these thirsty women never gave me no looks 
I was always crying and pathetic now I'm wise beyond prophetic 
With delivery so sharp that you forget about the message 
Im thankful for my blessing 
Living and learning lessons 
But Im stuck inside myself asking questions 

Man I don't want to change but I still need to grow 
They ask me who I am but I don't even know 
Man I don't want to change but I still need to grow 
They ask me who I am but I don't even know

Sharp darts, and it pop pop like tarts
Extreme speed like Anakin inside the Pod
Headed for the finish line, BOODOO, watch Bobby cross it
Hoes with the diamonds on your toes, come on and floss it
I be one of those tall skinny cats with the four-nine
Three-eleven that rips through Power-you's and breaks spines
I culture power-tuggin' boys who be drunk, buggin'
Lovin' loud noise from toys, club thuggin'
Sweet chocolate deluxe, rugged, sexy buttercup
That don't give a fuck about the cop in the club
Or the bouncer with the flashlight, one walked passed, right?
Some pulled the razor and chopped his ear like he was Mad Mike

Because you can't do me.. (x3)

Brooklyn bound, seven initials up in the crown
One man's ramblin', officials they shot him down
Supreme, extreme, lean, killin' machines
All I want to do is feed my seed, plus my team
Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal
Diabolic drums and I run from none
Testimony one, give my life before my only son
Thelonious crumbs, why they want to press me for guns?
Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug
From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs
As +It Was Written+, stroll through any block forbidden
Glock hidden, why they want to stop precision?
Eighty-five percent of my brothers locked in prison
And we just keep dyin' for the love of good livin'
But Do you! Do you! Do you!

You know those jams in the park, produced the spark
Made me feel words how I read books in the dark
I always took it to heart, loved the art
A lifetime of darts, ripped crews apart
Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport
Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die
Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry

Investment ranker who's a joke in the stocks
Keep a rhythmic pace, maintainin' great balance

In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Raizah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a ?nor? face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud, knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord

AND ALL THAT HARD ROCK SHIT (charged wit blasphemy)
AND IF YOU'RE FEELIN LIKE AN ENEMY (come after me)

[Killah Priest]
I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

[Trigga]
Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

[Prodigal Sun]
A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know

Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?

Hit rocks and niggaz know

Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness

With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp

'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill

Fauché, sans occupation, il n'y a pas pire

J'ai persisté, dit des trucs vrais, ai été pisté
J'ai insisté et le groupe IAM a existé
Pour de bon, j'étais sincère, j'écris des vers pour mes pairs
Et il n'y a qu'eux qui flippent derrière
De l'attention, ils se foutaient donc j'ai roulé pour ma poire

La route vers le but fixé est longue et périlleuse

So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man, True Mast', collabora-tion

[Chorus:]

Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs

[Verse One: True Master]

Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
And exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter

[Verse Two: Method Man]

Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
Or here lie, another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
To get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies
Turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, yo

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Prodigal Sunn]

I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth
I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mindstate
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?

[Verse Four: Hell Razah]

This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
? of Islam, keeps me calm
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
? , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I separate your Adam's Apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack

[Chorus]

[Johnny Blaze]
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, men from the Sun

Everyday be a court date recorded on tape

Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a ?nor? face

I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs

I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

[Trigga]
Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

[Prodigal Sun]
A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo

Trapped in the dandie's lion with a pit of lions
World crying, inside, what the fuck's goin on with me?
What's goin on? What's goin on?
Ugh! What's goin on? What's goin on?
Yo, yo

Deep in the Water of life, I would fight
Wearing turbens, purified up in the virgin
Emerging the blood, would flood up the wombs
The eggs hatch, and let loose, a fume
Prophecized just like Jesus, writing Hebrew
On the wall's of my mother's fetus
Then I was swimming in the afterbirth
Each chapter, each verse, got deeper, got worse
The keeper, of laws, my brain, what saw
The seeker, of tablets, preachers, would ban it
The force, brought forth, the holiest, controlliest
Slowly, takin me, into, the mental, orgasm
Was 'jaculating, stimulating, relating to life
Incubating, rotating around light beams
Like creams, I was formed in the white dream
Redeemed, like powder, outta, my maker
Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh.. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

I was born alone, begun from blood, skin and bones
To the mind, body, soul hunter, creating poems
For immature brain cells, trapped in confusion, I ruin your mental
I sent that ass to Hell and tell the devil that I sent you
I react like a reflex, protected by God
Bringin life to the brain-dead, diggin deeper than the graveyard
The stick that you walk with, I broke a long time ago
There's nowhere to hide when I stalk like a shadow
Everyday somebody dies, somebody else is born
A chain reaction, life's a cycle like plastic
I practice, ghetto bastards I'm givin caskets
Innocent, murderous is what you don't expect
While secret Satan agents be livin off your death
I'm already a waitin victim to an unknown death trap
Hell is gettin hot, is it too late for me to sweat that?
The killah team, guillotine get chopped where your heads at
In order to get revenge ya got to pass my dead end
I use your best friend to set ya up for me to win
To put the blood inside my pen to write my next sin
Then again, the beast from within, it just possessed
It leads me to kill, then I'm left with your bloody mess
I seem insane, since semen my brain been gained
Like Monopoly, but there's no way of stoppin me

I die slow, struggled in the wounds of evil
My technicality wins a race based on reality
Everyday is still a revolutionary thrill
The war's in the streets, bodies floatin down the bloody river
Terror, livin in this present day and era
Caged in the belly of the beast, thoughts of a killah
The duty of a wise man, prophecized, civilize the savage
Yeast, I generate heat from the East
Repells revelation, livin in revelation
The Sunz of Jacob shall fill the power of the nation
Created, situated, on physical plains, originated
From drops of sperm, the black germ
I come with the scientifical techniques and masses
The methods of madness, psycho wrath of gases
Burnin through flesh, deteariatin brain cells
Waves radiate as I escape the channel of Hell
The arsenal, one Prodigal, Sun of Man
Stalks the fuckin land with evil, various plots and plans
The wicked lashes shall buries us inside time and matter
I write chapters through the raptures of disaster

Trapped in a long dark tube, fightin for exsistence
Absorbin stressful germs as I travel the distance
Eternally locked in a cell in the form of sperm
Doing life, mental strife, evil semenal germ
Swimmin through revengeful cycles, accumlatin arches
Killin of the sperm cells, illuminatin darkness
Stranglin 'em with my tail, absorbin life from semen
When I was born I came out screamin and blasphemin 
Cryin in blood, spittin at the figure of Christ on the holy ?
See, since the sonogram I was diagnosed to be cursed
Doctors administered stress, I'd be born in the church
But they sold the womb closed of unholy bitches
A burst up, reversed and blast through the stitches
Ahh! Hell at last, my first breath that I cursed
They performed the ritual, took me home in a hurse
But in the womb I metamorphesized, my birth and death was already prophecized
Instead of a crib I slept in a casket
Sacrificed the first born but Christ denied this evil bastard

Or be comdemned to eternal livin death",Deep in the Water,1999

About to take you through the four stages of nature

Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent

You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor

I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin

Give me a beat, nigga dealin' battles like a thief
Done killed more niggas than Jason in part 3
Stay Wu, on the graveyard and this label
Dum dums, that battle 12 O'Clock, now it's able
So what, looked up and made the bitches clap
That was because my style's clothes, not the raps
Ain't that shit, props for the clothing
Should of brought a mirror, cuz lyric wasn't rollin'
My rhymes is all that and yours ain't shit
And at a party, your bitch takin' crazy flicks of me
She said I was nigga celebrity
But I'm from the slums, with the bums drinkin' Hennesey
Take a sip of some Jamaican rum
Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns
Make fools out of bitches like I'm Howard Stern

[Chorus 2X]",Rough Cut,2002
Prodigal Sunn,"""I think of sometime"" - sample repeated throughout the song

I see him Killa blast on 'em, never yo

I got the drop on you, don't flinch
Pop niggaz like John Lynch
Leave niggaz in they own stench
I'mma light drinker, heavy smoker
Known for duckin' show promoters
Pass the money, over, my whole crew is ex-cons
Be alarmed, when you hear the err-urrrrr
It's on, Silverback niggaz under the stairs
When we link up, we travel in pairs
Ya'll niggaz best to beware of the most thoroughest
Cover all aspects, four corners
You can't creep up on us
I'm takin' one for the team, deal me in
And when the smoke clears, do it again
This ain't a side show, you can die slow
There's no I in team, we all ride yo!
The Masta brought the ceremony, this is my testament
Homicide Housing, that's what I represent

Criminal gun play, chemical dream to P.J.'s
Last raid, another fed paid, bed rum: Sunday
The world dyin' for the love of money
Expensive chains, intensive pain from that cocaine
Condition the brain, children in strain, as I look back
Memory lane, civil and plain, it be in fame
A major part of the game, chemistry grain
Foolish kids ran when I came
Forty acres, five percent of terrain
Spark right through my vein tunnel, aim through this jungle of rain
A lot of haters wanna see us hang
But watch me bang as in Eagle/Crane
Step back, shatter your frame
Another victim in the system where he barely sustained
Forkin' in, I sold a million way, his first campaign
Sippin' rosemary cherry champagne, nigga
The young and the dangerous, water on the wrist, ice cryst'
Talk with a lisp, then I be top of your list

[Chorus]
We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever, yeah, yeah
We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever

Check the Words from the Genius, that was written in pen
Murder gloves, hide the fingerprint, but never the sin
Ghetto prophet that's born to quote
Got the crimies, behind me, with the face on stroke
Don't provoke, trust son, that thing bust, and we roll dangerous
Who can handle us, when we rush the clubs on thrust
Yo, don't miss the lead vocalist, terrorist
Wu-Tang, a pure danger, the God hold a fort
Teach law, universal, beat down, my stomping ground
We hold courts in the streets of New York
Snort the gun powder, eyes stay red like fire
Cut the mic wire, hit a love ballad note
Pen stroke, beautiful quote, for you to deep throat
Ghetto life had to rough up in the housing
They only make 'em us, every twenty five thousand

[Chorus]",Whatever,2004
Prodigal Sunn,"Come on

This is hip hop, M-C's get busy
It's not pop, you'll front and you'll get dropped
You're listening to slanged out goodies
And Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets

I was a young one at the time but started mic trippin'
Had rhythm like Ali when he was rope skipping
I got crazy when I heard the break beat
I used to lose it on niggaz on 4th and Main Street

They couldn't stop the attack once I moved forward
Many was drawn back, assault was seen awkward
Only armed with the bow and a mad flow
Poisonous arrows on a mark that was set to go

Traveling at high speeds towards a target
I never hit bystanders in crowded markets
Documenters catch this most intimate footage
In the center they come close, label it the hooded

Remarkable clips of an uncut episode
They was given the safe but never was left the code
Close up of those who have paved the road
Invincible armor like that nigga we call The Toad

This is hip hop, M-C's get busy
It's not pop, you'll front and you'll get dropped
You're listening to slanged out goodies

You're listening to slanged out goodies
And Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets

Havoc on the block, shots from the ratchet, sizzle pop
Slugs spinning outta control, body's drop
You know the saying in the hood, fuck the cops
Certified on the clock, them ducks with metal glocks

It takes place on the planet in rocks
Take nothing for granted, raised by these thieves and bandits
The enchanted, sticky green keeps my eyes slanted
Hard times coming up in the ghetto but the Sunn manage

Watch me take advantage, get it, split it, panoramic
The notes I quote, water like the great Atlantic
Never catch me frantic, swift with the antics
Bitch, niggaz vanish, niggaz, they run rapid

Sun of a man, son of the sun, son of a gun
Breaded from the slums of each one and teach one
What's done is done, son, the game is made
Stay sharp like switchblades, continue to get paid

This is hip hop, MC's get busy
It's not pop, you'll front and you'll get dropped
You're listening to slanged out goodies
And Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets

You know a motherfuckin' hit when it split ya wig back
Young gatling, strapping a .38 revolver
It's going down, wait for the sound, my soldiers rally 'round
Ninja men, blending in with the surrounding

'nough gunmen, 'nough flat bush, yardmen strapped with the vest
No pussy test the God, the grounds is well held
Illegal desert eagle, cadaver dog
Search for the body that's lost, of course it's BK

You heard niggas got killed for sheik coats and big ropes
Legendary students that sold coke
Some blocks that's still hot from shots popped back in '88
The black gate where son lay, never made the paper

Just another caper pulled by a masked killer, broad day light
Crown Heights, some are Fahrenheit, heat blazing
Cops on the beat, stop the money flow of the street
My dough is whole wheat, the fam gotta eat

This is hip hop, M-C's get busy

Yo, IAM, Sunz Of Man from the Royal Fam
Never ate ham, never gave a damn
In the begining there was darkness, then came light
I grab the mic to dis' your ass just for spite, what?
You can't fuck with the flows I bring
Watch the staff I swing (my man!)
It's Timbo King, astonishing, I'm dramatic to the ear
Television tells lies to your vision so, beware
Of the trick-nology sent forth to fool the mind
If you're dumb you're lost, if you're wise you will find that
Poison is a devil substance made for scratch'
'Cause one rotten apple destroys the whole batch
You scratch, I throw jabs to your jaws so quick
You get bashed in the head with a stone-face brick

Those who force kids tell lies to the youth
My grandchild, my roots run deep, here's proof, what?

À dix-sept ans, je me suis fait une raison
J'étais un petit con, un nerveux, spasmophile, baston
Et je frappais un coup de pied dans la table, tout volait
Envenimé par la négativité
Tant d'échecs, tant de défaites
Ont forgés le mordant, pour encaisser les coups dans ma mentalité
Fauché, sans occupation, il n'y a pas pire
Je ne possédais rien et je voulais fonder un empire
J'ai persisté, dit des trucs vrais, ai été pisté
J'ai insisté et le groupe IAM a existé
Pour de bon, j'étais sincère, j'écris des vers pour mes pairs
Et il n'y a qu'eux qui flippent derrière
De l'attention, ils se foutaient donc j'ai roulé pour ma poire
Comme le gaz, les intouchables phases de mes phrases
J'ai même changé d'avis pour la Saga
C'est plus je revenais quand tu allais, j'y retournais

La route vers le but fixé est longue et périlleuse
Souvent bordée de tavernes aux enseignes lumineuses
Et c'est dur de résister à l'invitation
De rester posé sur le rail comme un wagon
Telle une flèche filer droit sur la cible
Ignorer les ragots est la seule solution possible
Le temps passe trop vite pour que j'y prête
Une attention quelconque
Je sais qu'en fait tout le monde veut la même chose
Mais personne ne veut que tu l'obtiennes avant les autres

Prodigy,"Yeah A we gone do this up son
Yo we from Hempstead as close to the shacks as Parkside

[Chorus]
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style

Welcome to the PSG I represent
The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em
I straight up skin em like wolves 
I wish you would have been 

Fakin' jack and get ya whole hood hit
But it's all good 
We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood

So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it 
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet

While y'all was droppin' I was underground shadow boxin'
Layin' low puttin' final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin' to snatch that dough
Got niggas breakin' camp like Dre from Death Row

From the streets to the jail, I represent well
Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail
Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save 
Grade up in the U.S. now let?s get this paper

[Chorus]

I'm yawnin' while I wake up to the early morning gun-fire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed tried to break my alarm
Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm

Grab my Pelle Pelle 'cause I want to look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instincts
I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck

I'm stuck, in this environment can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started 
Plan A square one there's no escapin'
So I pun and realize my too

I'm tryin' to live a full life before my time is through
Clock's tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals
Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it

(To all my kiko's)
It's sort of like a family brawl
We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again

Drinkin' straight from the bottle warm gin drippin' down my chin
For the crippled children you can't win 
Against 25 niggas bent up with mac-10's
Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict

So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it
There's many different levels of the criminal mind
Either you're in it for the gusto or I'm wastin' your time

[Chorus]

Now is you ready for men, 'cause they your peeps that you saw
You probably heard about me and my crew doin' what we do
For my nigga True and Smif-n-Wessun
'Cause I be wreckin' mic-checkin' fools that come around second-guessin'

I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky
Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high
The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label
'Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal

What's my time to shine my design you can't define
It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
To have you buggin', niggas got they tapes dubbin
Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin' and shovin'

Now it's over, walkin' like a soldier I told ya
Shorty droppin' bombs and shit, like Oklahoma
Kinda soul, comin' wit that bomb for sure 
Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour

[Chorus] 

First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The cream'll have you shittin' on your people
Livin like lotto, everything is everything

Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army in techses

And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been tryin' to blow for years
Gettin' bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet

To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you're lookin, you can find me risin' to the top
I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked

Floatin' in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic
I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky

While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match

It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on, my outfit 

Stuck on some wild out shit, all about it 
We move gambit, through the overcrowded 
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips 
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc

There's no escape from straight from the brain come the great one 
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head 
Slit your snake tongue, make one false maneuver you a mystery... 

Unsolved, the mob that we robbed's automatically involved 
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs 
Rock turtledove bowery suits and purple gloves 
Me and you can have some fun 

Make it a blast, you couldn't take the impact 
With steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood 
Veteran, covered in mud 
Wounded in the midst of war 
Still tradin' slugs gettin' major love 

Way above you newcomers, I come thunderin' 
With the heat of two summers when I enter the zone 
Move mountains with the presence alone 
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You private eyes home in 
But can't seem to clone

So I can join the rest of my falls, up in the heavens

Flow like dro, I pull then clip it or mix it with some moet then sip it
Then turn around and flip it, shit on your whole album wit a snippet

Run up on your lawyer for your contract then rip it
Shame on your label, for trying to let you eat at my seat
When they know I call my name at this table
I'm goin' always be here, and y'all always gonna fear

Y'all give me sixteen yo I'll tear this whole city up
And niggas don't believe then tell em put fifty up

All bets is down, all my thugs do dirt, all our tecs spit rounds
My ? playas disrespected clowns
Bringing guns, weed and coke to connected towns
See I pop niggas like corn, and real killers do killings wit the lights on

I knock em out, cause I don't like to fight long
Remember me lefty gun up in my right palm
It's mysonne, see mysonne is the one that knock on your door

Y'all cowards don't want war, yy'all can't stand pain
Cop you some gators, drink champagne

'Cause when it comes to the street shit, I let the heat lift
Murder scene police lines nigga white sheet shit
Y'all roll wit niggas, I'm the one they roll wit
Y'all go get niggas, I'm the one they go get

Y'all niggas don't want nothing to do wit me
'Cause I spit guns and rhymes like their's two of me

[Prodigy]
Niggas can't be serious, we wear guns like clothes
But only show em when it's time to blow em in bulk
We been through way worse then war, razor fights and more
Left niggas wit leaks, holes and wide jaw

Be the quiet storm, appear how you want to scale bar
Check out your weight, see if it's worth to war
We did the street life y'all niggas just got involved
My appetite for guns is similar to carnivores

Dislike me you head on, fight me you dead wrong
'Cause now a days you only get wet wit my dead on
Don't let this song push you, the fourth hit you
Have you keyed up gasping for breath on the floor cripple

Infamous we take it to the extremes my words
Especially when a nigga mistake me for herb
Get buried over words, I'm loose wit the dessy bird
I can show ready or tell, y'all niggas heard

Now gitty up now, it's lighting horse back saddling
Rob beaches like we rowing a boat and we paddling
Down a stream of water, wet any nigga challenging
Blow one all in your knee cap leave you staggering

Scrambling cause theirs a whole lot of shit we be handling
My hands all in the money, fuck it we dibble and dabbling
Got you imaging how this could really all be happening
My landscape of live niggas stretch from here to Maryland

Blaw put one in a nigga who be rambling
And blow a hundred thou if y'all niggas is really gambling
Gritty niggas feel the snap pop leaving it crackling
You know the bouncer keep all of my live niggas wild wit him

Traveling to see niggas from Howard through grambling
Ha round up my niggas to form a large gathering
Yo rattling niggas who walk bad limp
Beat you in the same place till the blues start blacking

CEO niggas stay general managing
Flipmode throwing those heavy bundles we carrying
Yo analyze my many live niggas cramming it
We throw a three pointer, while y'all niggas throwing javelins

Sweating your whole shit, feel your clothes damping
Dancing in a line of four wheel drives we lamping
The [unknown] arms length up in the draw paneling
Or unraveling the truth on how niggas remain champions
Ha, ha, ha

It seems like life's tryin to put me through a test
'cause every fuckin day it's just gettin worse
what's worse? Might go out, die hard and end up in a hearse
But no time to think about the consequences
The years in jail, fuck the death sentence
All I know is that I need mad cash in a flash
Befo' I gotta kill somebody ass
Might as well be in jail or dead
'cause if you ain't gettin paid then you ain't gettin ahead (that's word nigga)
Sittin in my room with the lights out thinkin'
I'm alive, but I ain't livin, I'm leakin'
I made my bed and I'ma lay in it
But I ain't gonna stay in it
I might start sprayin shit
I should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue
Fuck a G.E.D., that's like toilet tissue
All my friends are hoodlums and hustlers
Runnin with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers
Niggaz fuckin their money up, niggaz gettin knocked
And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block
Though I could start flippin gettin on a mission

But I need much more, no time for bullshittin'
Niggaz listen...

The H-E-A-T- makes me crazy
I want to bust somethin, figures, touch somethin'
The heat is on, got a niggaz blood rushin'
I want to touch somethin, niggaz bust somethin'

Yo, all I know is guns, all I do is slug
I'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front
My life revolves around the snub 4th
Stay gettin those outside of New York
Bullets from the cornerstone, I'm bringin home a arsen
Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson
Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses
Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous
Back at home sell a few burners
Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal
Walk with benevolence, holdin twin fifths
380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick
That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me
Niggaz be lyin, tellin stories, tell it walkin'

Knotty head for them niggaz on the nightshift pumpin'

What the fuck time is it!?!
It's like 3 o'clock, man, thought you was coming to get me, man!?!
... shit, my bad son.
Please, man, come get me man, before I choke this bitch, man!
Hurry up son, man it's like 90 man, let's get some hoes or something.

What up, dun!?!
Same ol' shit.
No doubt, ain't nothing new... .
Let's take a little spin, dun, word up.

Yo... open my wings to a new day spread my lungs
Get laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns
Twist the key, shifted to D then flee
Before anything, get the daily dose of choke
We got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float
My eye's burnin' from the dope killin' my throat
Lean my seat a taste, lumbar support
On the belt doin' 90 or more
debatin' on the latest rhyme wars
Where units don't count
But your rap pay add up to large amounts
Get my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep
Catch chills off'a infamous beats
Swing the trees doin' one-handed you'ees
Blowin' on the ouwee ?cause we can't have the medicine canoein'
There go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that
Ay yo dun, hold that down and turn it around
Dirty as fuck, thugs drugs and guns, d's and fatigues

Ay yo twin, what the fuck... ..

They had us laid out on the ground holdin' us down
With gats to back of our heads was goin' down
?It wasn't us that held up that bitch you got.
Where's the proof, man!? Let me speak to my attorney.?
I know the routine, don't try to throw me
I been gettin' knocked since 12 and my moms tried to scold me
... but all that told me to get in more shit
ay yo P', (what up) you my co-d, we both get knocked
What you did with that half'a tree? (right in my sock.)
Yo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot
Dun, you know how I get down!?!
Yo I'm ready to bounce
Do the 100 yard-dash and tear ass
If my other half was alive we woulda got killt
?'cause dun woulda went for the guns and got ill
Plus I gots cracks on me, they foundt the cracks on me
Looked at'em, gave'em back to me
I could swore they was takin' us in
Then the lady in the car said, ?..that's not them.?
Picked us up, told me I could keep the drugs
They didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns
An' you ain't gotta tell us twice
We hopped in the car and slid off
On our way up-town for more of that funk
P' lit the tree back up
Got off the Tri-burrough, hit the Henry Huds'

Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids

Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jemel and Jamal

When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit

""Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P""
But it was all love, we was eash others dunns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns

Could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the web of your palm, against mine 
'Cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?

Now gun talk, do you speak the same language?
For your sake, I hope so, let's rap a taste yo
My shit spit like a retard, and plus boss
I drool for the day me and you could face-off
It gets gangster, when my clique step in the room
We blow torches, and celebrate good fortune
This is for my dunns who rest in coffins
I wish why'all was, wish why'all was here

Yo what the deally P? Iraq, can buy out Q.B.
And you know we smash the industry, negatively
So fuck a good boy, I always been a foul hood boy
Yo as a youth I had ring-worms, and all that shit
A lil' dirt ball nigga, throwin dirt at ya clique
Cause me an Aknel nigga ain't packed no bags
We rather, be in the streets, sellin yellow mesc' tabs
Cause where we from, muh'fucker yo the game don't stops
Or we was, out thuggin yo we had chicken-pox
Me Mus', Maze, Outlaw, +Final Chapter+ brigades
It definitely get real, on stage
I ain't the Madd Rapper, but I'm mad at rap niggaz
They're sellin records yo, actin like they clap niggaz
Cause me and P. get money like L.S.G.
While them cats small change like a E.S.3.
Yo I'm still the same cat, that I used to be
Often, I'm on tour with my rosaries
Coastin, always hit 'em with the thug potion
Look at you now, now you just full emotion
Prankster height, my peoples like the gangster-type
Queens niggaz like to shoot, ain't afraid to fight
While why'all niggaz wear Pampers like the cradle type
Mainly hype, thugged-out, shined with light

Naw, you can never feel my pain nigga
And you can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel my pain nigga
How do I start it

Nineteen seventy four, mutherfucker I was born with pain
My moms and my pops pass it down to me
So don't talk to me about can I feel yours
'Cause I ain't feelin' you at all, your pain is impure

You cryin cause you grew from the projects
That's not pain, that's emotions, you a bitch
I'm talkin' bout permanent, physical suffering
You know nothin' about that, you just complain cause you stress

Nigga, my pain's in the flesh
And through the years that pain became my friend; sedated
With Morphine as a little kid
I built a tolerance for drugs, addicted to the medicine

Now hospital emergency treat me like a fiend
I rather die sometimes I wish a nigga O.D.
Beggin' God for help, only to find that I'm all by my god damn self
Ay, You can never feel my pain nigga

[Chorus]

And the females ask...P, why you always look mad
Don't mind me if I may come off like that
But see, a nigga depressed, I need smoke
I need me a drink, I'm tryin' to stop those

Experience life, through the shoes of me
What you find, is you can't do that, you ain't built for it
The impact I put on this earth
Is nothin' like you ever seen or heard; so look listen

When I speak, sit up in your seat
Pay attention to the words, cause the story is deep
In and out of crisis, since before I could walk
It gave me strength though, now a days I hardly talk

It made me cold-hearted, anti, I won't play sports
I barely joke or play games, take it how you want
My handicapped took its toll on my sanity
My moms got me at the shrink at like 13

And doctors called the cops on me
'Cause I be throwin' on [unknown] and they ignore me
I gotta, try to calm down and breathe
I can only hold it but for so long; put me to sleep

Do I sound insane...
If I do, then this here was written for you

Makes fake niggas disperse, they never challenge what works

Balancing the weakness, is what I specialize in 
Dunn you my nigga cause you keep me hype when I'm writing 
Kept me on point in the night when it might go down 
Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well 
Kept me focused on what's real and nothing else 
I find it healthy, to conversate with myself 
I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years)

Told you when it's time to put it away

Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferrari's 
with two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right 
See niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back 
Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back

The way I see it both bitches and niggas, is the same

Know sometimes you just got to show niggas how you do things

Hear me out, put a bullet in your mind

[Prodigy]
Yo son they caught me from the blind side me the Pee
The one who spread love, me I never shit on my peeps
I never left my dogs out in the cold
I extended my hand with compassion, you extended yours in war
Cool fuck it, why y'all snakey mother fuckers
Gonna learn how this nigga rock quiet storm niggas
Leave you shot for dead, nigga I'll rot your flesh
By myself come for delf and just pop your head
Now have a good night you snake skin bastard
See you at the crossroads fagot
And in the mean time and in between time
Pee will be laid up with more shines, more dollars for more nines
More boxes of talons to put in your spine
You cross me nigga you lost your mind
Scratch that you never knew from the start
So I forgive you, after you die skirmish, shots burneth

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Son the get back, is so sweet
The taste of revenge your blood on the street
It's called payback for that shit you pulled
I don't respect your gangsta my guns explode
Son the get back (yeah), is so sweet
The taste of revenge your blood on the street
It's called payback for that shit you did
Two wrongs don't make it right, it make it even bitch!

[Ammo]
Son we chose life fast, and niggas kept stunting
Had to show our ass straight up explode right fast
It sounds cold but we roll like that
Ripping rats finished off our path, we was close like that
All them nights that we threw back yak
Who would thought he do me like that straight leave me flat
Niggas ain't never feed me black, want to see me clap
Blood filling up the cement crack
Straight snakes and I resent that I fall back try to prevent that
Try not to be bent at, foul atmosphere
Stunning what's happening here
Got me 'bout to dumb out dumping out Macs in here
Niggas catch a hot one, fucking with Am this year
Wet every man in here vengeance lost my senses
why y'all start quarrels I end it
And show up at your wake full of sorrow pretending
To blend in

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo I blow holes in moschinos, splash niggas in they mink ?stoles?
Down to their Kenneth Coles, fuck model bitches center fold
Never love a hoe, you got guns let it go my nigga let it blow
And what had killed you is what you don't know
It's two-five goodfellas getting dough
Yo my mom chose dope made love to the needle
I caught 'em fucking numerous times and turned evil
Back in '89 you can say I'm trapped in time
Still thirsty like a little nigga dying to shine
Baby moms said I got issues, too many problems
I rock timbs 'til my socks turn orange
Do a nigga dirty, relate to the unworthy
A young G with Q-T and black shirty
I've been nice since lee pin stripes and British knights
Fore' building razor tag and sword fights
Niggas see the light when they start losing pints
You can die by the gun or the knife
And I'm nice with both, coming at me with the wrong approach
Don't make me Arab neck tie your throat, you bitch nigga!

Yous a notebook crook with loose leaf beef
A backseat criminal who pass the heat
To somebody that blast the heat
Man it sound bad on the pad what happened in the street
A villain on the vinyl an analog outlaw
A lot of gats on your DAT taped southpaw
You thuggin when the mics plugged in
Barkin through the speakers like you got no sense
You're wild on the 2 inch
Got your platinum plaques to prove it
Your music's been around the world movin
And it come right back around to the ground on it
Now its time to face your opponent
Infamous cling to this real shit
Stuck where we started at
Fuck that
Not because I have to we want to
I love this shit
The raw is what I live for
To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door
Wildin on the dance floor when they song come on
Swinging they fists
Ready for war but its a different type of effect
Its not violence
They're just tranced by the advance
Tranqued by the sound bank
Put under the drum
Numbed off of our shit
Now who you rocking with them or us
Deep love or cheap lust
QB or bust
Infamous til we pass on
You're laughing at the wrong kid I take action
The fam are confidants, nigga
I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of being top dog
As we move through the stage floor I need to bass more
So I can taste it and make y'all go AWOL and lose it 
Say no more
Brace your delf nigga its on

Who tale you tellin
Are you frail or felon
Were you makin sounds or watchin niggas sellin
You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid em
You never felt the moisture in the air from coke boiling
You never felt the razor scrapin your plate your hands achin
Yet you keep choppin cause there's paper to make
You never felt the power of invincibility
Clutchin a gun like fuck it dun
Its him or me
At your best you wasn't hand to hand 
No more than 3 grams
What the fuck you know about a ki man
You never hustle
Lets get it right my nigga wild woulda stuck you
Stop dry snitchin in your rhymes listen
What you tryin to do help the guys in blue
Indict duns so that could be another rhyme for you
You a parasite you never had a life
So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night
Its clever when you write it
Spoken well for a dude who never been indicted
You know the deal motherfucker
The real make the fake niggas kneel
And lose appetites when you taste nigga's steel
My rhymes are what it take to get a deal
That make it real
I'm like BIG you can't replace the skill
I laced your ill like cocaine in scarface's grill
Your motherfuckin flow is basic kill
I'm Cor Mega raw forever
Y'all niggas know my steez I'm reppin for Queens
Your minor league I'm big time like Mark McGwire's deed
Your whole team is pussy
When I squeeze vaginas bleed
My lyrics they official
I bag up coke on dishes made of crystal
Your niggas they will miss you
My nickel plated pistol got 16 shots
You can take em with you
To the coffin or DAs office

Life suddenly divorced and fuck it it cost him

Your money's that long, you ain't that strong

They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin' just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this

Independent regardless of the fact I'm a signed artist
Fuck a deal it matters who comes hardest
When I entertain, It's like I took Sedrick for his name
Hunger is just a different form of pain

I'm ready to eat, ready to hear my name spread on the street
To the point where I don't talk, my trackrecord speaks
To the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks
To the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week

Bringing the heat, so clear you understand me
Raise the stakes, up the antique
The better place, yo we land on winds

Tell the DJ turn the music up
Gangsters in the club, everybody thugs
Me I play the walk, sipping on the Guinness
Cause in reality we are the same and it's
Just society they want to see me
Flesh on the concrete, sold a perfect story
The mystery is waking up in misery
The music industry brainwash celebrities
Girls sleep sexy, they wake up with a monster
Have no idea that their face was a piranha
Word from the wise I can see through the fog
Reason why they rob cause they got no job

But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning
Feel like it's gonna be a good day
No war on the street, no way, today
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight
You shine, I shine and
The whole world looking like a gold mine
You get yours and I'll get mine
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times

When they see me they ask me
Will there ever be another Fugees
I say I don't know but hope the trio
Don't do like ? ? then ? on Sadaam though
But on CNN they saw the same
Little kids getting shot at close range
To Babylon, we don't want no war
I'm a send a message in a bottle to the White House, Lord
These are the words from the master
So don't you wait till the day after
Until then you can catch me in the sixes
Just pumping Bob Marley rebel music now

You get yours and I'll get mine
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times

No, no homeless in Grand Central Station
Boys and girls going to schools with no tools

We've been lied to, enslaved and beaten up
We're immune to what you call pain, it's nothing
We're not scared of dying or afraid of guns
Born in the USA, nah, can't blame us
Our DNA's foreign to them
We kings of the planet Earth, Gods if you will
Yo, cash be my ?, it's about to get stupid

This is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits pop

Hey, hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys' pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

5-8 with double-X-L, pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity, the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete

So you can be an architect, design apartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set, I'm never on a chick, I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet, it's just the booze

Check my niggaz, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggaz runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down

Now it's back to the same old shit
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines
I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit

Bloodied up, screamin', I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

It's like this nigga, it's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live

Well, first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
""Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open""
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot

Deuce, deuce, had my pockets full of bullets, I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash, always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queens bridge, always got shot up

No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggaz aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old English Red Bull and Blue Bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit, fuck it, we was broke

Little bad ass, my nigga rap sat me down, like this
He said, ""P, you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind off the street""

And it stuck in the back of my head
Though I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen
Niggaz get cut up, I put it in my rappin'

It's non fiction, it's the real deal fiscal
It couldn't get more graphic, I'm so trail
I said, it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscal
City you havin', let me touch that ass

So tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes

Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for cenetries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work

I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, don't be a hater son

Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your a** up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying n****

You ain't a player hust a frail n****
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street

Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix

Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went

Peep into the case, see me, ask
Why that black a** n**** flow over the piano
Droppin it good
For that hoody in the front row

that's my good pro down for the juggalo
Three guns busted for the battle man
Shoot the whole scene make the motherf***er rattle

Either man rush I'm gonna hit em with the head rush

Heard a couple shots
Caught one in the leg

I love that drama s***
I'm all ga**ed up
I lit that kush up and got doughed up
And thought about all the foul s*** I did

I can't help it, I was this way since a kid
Then I slide out the crib
Hunt down my pray
The look in my eyes like I sniffed some yay

Ran up on homes
And blast away
He pa**ed away twin got the last laugh today

I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggaz rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggaz wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why they solve them CB4 niggaz just keep comin at me

Dunn the streets took my dreams and shattered them
And turn me into a preacher
Minds to money got me not givin' a fuck

All I care about is muzik and who I gotta cut
With the Mac, uzi, .47, pick a weapon
Six million ways to die, my .25 endin'

I try keepin' it peace but that shit's for chumps

Made the nigga cold blooded, ain't no friends on the block
This the comrades and coldies, the crooked ass police

Look don't ask me why Queensbridge can't stick together
If you don't know the answer then you don't know the ghetto

Everybody wants to be boss, it ain't enough soldiers
Everybody wants to call shots, it ain't enough shooter

And it really hurts my soul that we can't click

By myself in my four corner room watchin' Hard Boiled
I feel like I'm crazy, my brain on drugs
My bullet proof on run, flats late at the night
I'ma look for 'cause

Just ride through his hood and when I see that chump
I'ma jump out the truck and dump my gun
You ain't neva been do it so you scared of that kinda shit
Hit me on a song and say, P pop a lot off shit

Too much of that gangsta music, nah, this reality rap
I really go through it in interrogation rooms
I don't crack, nigga, I don't got none for ya
Talk to my lawyer, shit

Nowadays is hard to kill
Be careful where you pull that trigger, they got you on film
They got eyes in the sky, we under surveillance
That on star on your car track everywhere you've been

Gotta watch what I say, they tappin' my cell phone
They wanna sneak and peak inside of my home
I'm paranoid and it's not the weed
In my rear view mirror these cars, they follow me

So I bust rights and lefts, lefts and rights
Till I stop seeing those Impala headlights
Then I circle my block to make sure it's smooth

Hungry and angry and I'm savagery

Where I'm from?
Killers go dumb
Usually deatch is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle
Where kidnappers hunt you
The streets they really want you
Serious
No smile on this block gives answers gets per curious
Good times disappears quickly back into a mist
Shoot I hardly ever miss
That means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch
Then pretty soon I have to switch
Scratching the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams ""who next?""
Like my nigga 2-Tech he totes 2-techs.
It been a beef before in Houston they called it ""plex""
They got to know the protocol 
I'm warning y'all
It gets deep
So deep the prison guards will put you to sleep
Rest eternally
No coming back
You OD'd
Overdose
This neighborhood got me comatose
Back up against the wall another statistic I know

[Chorus Z-Ro]
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a soldier and I'm about my mail
If I get busted I'm not about to tell
Because I'm a gangster
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a solider and I'm about my mail
I ain't trying to do right because I'm already living in hell
Because I'm a gangster

[Will Hen]
The gas prices are too high
Pay raises too low
I'm better off in the game flippin kicks like Judo
Or out somewhere pimpin getting money by the two hoes
That's why I'm in the lab with The Product spittin new flows
Feds watchin my hood entirely too much gunplay
Neighborhood basketball star slained last Monday
Raided the neighborhood kingpin last Tuesday
If this was going on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masses
Low and middles class still carrying bus passes
Young girls giving birth before they hit the 9th grade
About to be a mom and can't even make cool-Aid
Who made this crack anyway?
Told this about this herron 
Sold us to alcohol and the guns that we care-on

[Chorus Z-Ro]

[Scarface]
It's like the ghetto got a heart and a soul
A mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat die before he grown
A lust for a young girl sliding down the pole
She's always falling short on her goals
The street life is cold
It's either when you lose or you fold
Money is the root of all evil is what I was told
And everything that you thought you would leave there is a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons and when the smoke clear
The truth appear
The fight for your life
The struggles of the wrong versuses right
And wrong won
The song sung
In the keys of reality 
When death crosses your path bloodshed tragically
So automatically you come to a close
And realize no matter what the key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow motherfuckers whole
Then shit them out in the system ain't never make it home
I know

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin 

had to find my place 

But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue 

had to dodge a case 

Had to dodge a bullet 

And the nigga that tried to pull it 

The streets is throwed 

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday 

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive 

All my life this drive I tried 

I seen a lot of good niggas die 

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched 

Or somebody's a bitch 

I wish I could change the past 

But I gots to live in the present and pray 

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast 

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me 

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself 

I found out she had to told me 

Just to show me just how good I had it 

I guess I couldn't see it 

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it 

But that was just the way we used to G it 

One of the wrongest niggas I see 

Or one of the strongest niggas I know 

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know 

So I put weed in the bong and I blow 

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected 

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected 

Too real

I can't complain 

Stuck in the game 

Tryin to maintain 

Cause I'm so real

We blow big everyday 

But that don't stop our pain 

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game 

Got niggas doin 40 

When you 25 that's life 

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price 

These bitch ass niggas shife 

Niggas might snitch out they momma 

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama 

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow 

But nigga you promised to die 

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry 

At night I talk to God and try to understand 

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man 

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back 

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks 

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones 

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun 

I guess that's true for some 

But them hoes will never win

The game is overcrowded so we fight for space
Neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win
Tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay
And double up it, ain't never happened touch it
A lot of niggaz focued on they candy paints
And that was in the grills, steering wheels and grand
But I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to thank
Money miny, yo all the mission tryin' to steal me bank
Ride and homicides we get it, fuck it, peepin' in horn
Killin' all these pussy niggaz think they keepin' in God
Pistol cocked on the block and all they fearin' is death
Then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet
So if I die, I'm tryin' to get it mamma, barely deed
And pray to God that he kept this spot hell me
Sad as fuck, what the nigga stuck down the raw
Bust friends, back in the prison, foundin' rock to the troup
Here I smoke and tryin' to hide it but was played by the rule
And if live like the gold fiend then you'd do what they do
I'm on my own limits sold buck words
All alone in the ghetto, deep in weed, sweat in Jelly Nose
Worrey eyes, you either do it or you die
Crimin' in flood, ridin' your blood, cause this is your life...

Our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
And still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? loose when you pumped the face
Real nigga blues and it hold your aims
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life

I just got word: my uncle done died
But ain't no tears on my face cause I done already cried
I been here before, dead to me is not new
My heart safe it, mamma don't, cops too
I got my best to get my purpose to the Lord
But sometimes this shit be fuckin' with me hard
And I'm heartless, I'm a kid again
Lookin' out my window watchin' niggaz get murdered
In college worked the parties, step with??, drink ??
Just to get through the night
Go to school only the anchor stomach givin' you fight
Cause sure there were fights and I was bustin' like a the sun bitch
The smartest nigga on the block live in ??kick
The convicts with worry ?? hard to ?? to the tails
Searchin' for heaven and livin' in hell
They say I'm wrong for teaches this on
Fuck what you believe, can't heal by myself
That's the way I'm livin', this is my life

Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life

I only got one eye but I see things ever so clear
Been acquainted with death but I never know fear
I still roll to spots, cats scared to go there
If it's a heaven for a G, if not, prepare to go there
I live for today and not promise tomorrow
Smoke weed and set lead and try to dry my sorrows
In this game of life ain't no rules to follow
And if I come to lie for them it's a hard heal to swallow
I'm still the smallest cat with the biggest rep in H-Town
Stress in my life is gettin' hard to take down
Havin' visions of cats rollin' in my weight now
It feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down
It takes a big man to share this pride
Tryin' to get my soul right and put the brain inside
Y'all niggaz are so scared to ride
They got it from Still I alive to Why I Feel So bad inside
This is my life

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away...

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say hello on a day like today
Say it everytime you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head...

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can't stand here like this anymore

We ain't got no time, in the city of gold
Trying to get me some sunshine
An avoid the patrol
Ah yea

I'm fed up
All I want is a little nice weather when I get
A lot of people arrive zealous
But life here's, less than a dream, more a nightmare
Welcome to the city of gold, the city I roam
Home to the grittiest roads
It's hardly a party, getting our p's
On the same corner where women sell narni
I live amongst vermin I'm stuck
But I couldn't give a, fuck as long as I'm earning
Long been accustomed to the ways of the manor
The filth are an occupational hazard
Parked chilling in a car park grinning
It's gone midnight an I'm half past sinning
Got a dark heart wicked with my ras clart lyrics
I'm a bad boy you don't wanna start no shit with

Time's precious
An it moves fast in a city full of bright lights and tight dresses
Medusa's that'll seduce ya if ya ain't ready
A city that makes few and breaks many
The city I'm in's, less like the city of gold
More like the city of sin
Where everybody's in it to win
From villainous nippers to city slickers with sinister grins
Straight, ain't religous, never been into hymns
An I pushed bars before I'd ever been in a gym
So for my freedom I keep hoping
Cause I don't wanna walk through the doors these keys open
I don't know if you think it's nice or something?
But I can show you a different side to London
To think you came here for the treasure?
But nobody ever came here for the weather

Up to bother trying not to get collared by the piggies
Ah yea

Jack the lad I put the work in
For the wage of sin
Even if by some poor sod's loss
I care not I will take the win
Many came so full of hope
Only to be deflated
The roads we walk ain't paved in gold
Alone is how our days spent
Don't think cause I'm polite that I'm nice g
Or cause I'm well dressed I ain't grimy
I got food for them city heads
Just another aggie yout that the city bread
The cloud I'm under thunders loud
I ain't waiting for the day the sun comes out
If you wonder what I'm under now
The same shit I was and will be till I'm underground

Close the door behind me, start thinking 'bout what's in front of me ooh

I don't mean to be ungrateful and I could never tell you something if it ain't true.
I'm stable, and I find its easier for me being single than it is being faithful.
I ain't alone 'cause I know you've got needs too, and from a distance its nothing I can see to.
I'd rather leave you, than insult you with the lies, 'cause I'm really not as sly as to deceive you.
Time for us both is so precious, selfish is never what I meant to be.
In a business where sin is relentless and nobody sees nothing in the VIP, I don't know if it's a place I was meant for, or if its everything I always ever dreamt for.

I don't wanna live my life this way. No!
Picture me behind a desk, picture that a nine to five I ain't into that, I'm into rap and I don't see me getting an office job with these tat's.
So what choice do I have man? Do I sign on or do I bag grams? Long signing for dole, I wanna get signed for my flow and my rhymes.
I'm a pro and I'm nice I know, if I grind then I'll blow so why am I wasting time on the roads.
Now Mike's interested I should probably give it a rest before I get arrested, but then I got arrested whoops.

Why don't I learn from my mistakes? Why oh why oh why.. All I want's to change my ways Why oh why oh why Do I always end up back here, stuck on the wrong side of town.
With my head spinning I keep on falling down.

Never been arrested for so much as an eighth of weed and I get arrested for kidnap, blackmail, false imprisonment and possession with intent to supply.
Typical of my fuckin' luck really innit, just as I'm about to sign a deal with Mike I might be doing a fucking bird.

I don't wanna sell weed no more, hated the cycle but I kept peddling.
Nan just found food under my bed again, I'm a let down again, And she's screaming ""get this shit out of my house"" again.
There's no curving the truth, the bags too big to be for personal use, there's no excuses she knows what the truth is.
I do flip Keys of green to get me a few quid.
She's looking at me so disappointed, all I can say is I wont do it again, but she knows I will..

[Chorus]

Never learn man. There's no plan B for me, I ain't got shit to fall back on! I left school in year 8 I don't have an education, selling weed and writing lyrics is all I know.

I got arrested and raided then I got signed and I bust case so now everything's fine.
But now everything's not, not only did I get dropped the whole label did, and I wasted my advance so I ain't got shit.
I'm stuck at warners and them pricks wont push my album, but it's cool; as soon as I'm free I'm gonna do it without them.
Eight months later I'm still stuck in my deal, in debt with my lawyer time to get back on this ferris wheel.
I'm stuck on this carousel when will this ever end!?
This is hell for me I'm back at the beginning again! Somebody please get me off this circus ride
The horse that I'm riding is hurting my thighs erm..

And before some funny guy tries to make a joke about me riding a horse, it is a metaphor! What I mean is I am sick of hustling, I am sick of the grind, I am sick of things going to shit, Just when things are looking up! I don't know if this shit is ever gonna work for me.

I shift po to get dough, lust P's.
If you ain't ever been broke? For you to judge me's an insult.
It's my life an' I'm living it, agreed we all have choices but mine limited mostly by my decisions.

If I new then what I new now, I'd a lived life different, I'd be a different me, but I didn't so this is me.
Me, in my position what would you have done? Would you of done what I did? Am I what you would of become?

My guess, my guess is you would of succumb like I did.
The decision was mine, but I was too young an' I picked the wrong path, I went the wrong way.
Left school then got the grade, banged it out, got my pape's.
Stacked my p's copped a cake, I'm holding weight now, made a brick of a ounce an' ain't been in the 
jail house.

I intend on staying free, free for me don't mean free from stress.
Lay in bed but I ain't asleep, from I need rest I just blaze the trees.
Drift off hearing my Nan say to me...

Goodnight God bless I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight God bless I'll see you in the morning.

I'm a dreamer but can only dream as long as I'm asleep,. I've been having trouble sleeping.
See Nanny Edie aint here to say goodnight no more, I had to say goodbye to her, inside is where resides the hurt.
Now all I feel is pain, after that nothingness. After that? Nothing since, after that there's nothing left.

Some of her last words were, I cant fight forever. Like she wanted to give up an' of life she was fed up.
She had to go, but I wanted her to stay, 'cause ever since she left things haven't been the same.
I need a new shelter from the rain, my face looking weathered, a facety looking bredder I'm fed up.
I know not what to do, see I'd love to say that I don't give a fuck but I do.

The gift an' curse that I'm blessed with, the pressures on road ain't nothing to the emotions that I wrestle with.
Stress got me in a figure four, raw is what I'm thinking, I wonder what I'm living for?
Is it only to hurt? First my Great Nan, now I gotta put my dad in the dirt.
Back in the earth, I wished we could have patched it up first, I was so angry though I just 
couldn't handle the hurt.

Now your in the back of a hearse. It hurts more than it ever did.
Sometimes I wish that I had never lived. Feels as if it would be better if if never did, live.
I don't know how I'm ever gonna get through this, shit.
I swear down blud I'm running on empty, My life ain't nothing to be envied.
So Goodnight",Goodnight,2010

You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way.

Welcome to Hackney
A place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji.
A Manor where man are like animals,
An' they'll yam on you like they yam on food.
Cats with claws that'll stab a yout', act bad an' catch a slap or two.
We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools.
London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters pray,
Looking lunch today,
And your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape.
They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do,
So stick to breezing through, like cheeta's do or be a piece of food.

When your out here in this jungle.
It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, aint nothing nice round 'ere,
Troubles what you find round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle.
Your always caught in this struggle, in this jungle .
But you keep asking for trouble, you love?
You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way.

It's blitz amidst the strife here,
Got kids with sticks and knifes here.
It's hype here, we know no different prick;
It's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown.
Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road.
God CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large, it's hard,
Not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars.
Jealousy's what the cheddar brings, for the cheddar it's anything goes,
Low enough to rob newly weds for their wedding rings
Everyday is warring, never give a warning,
Violence is the only way you settle things, everyday is hating,
Money that I'm making, jealous 'cause I'm moving on to better things,
Everyday is fighting, rolling in the night now.
All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard
When your out here in this jungle.
It's wild round 'ere, you don't wanna spend a night round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, ain't nothing nice round 'ere,
Troubles what you find round 'ere.
When your out here in this jungle, in this jungle.
Your always caught in this struggle, in this jungle .
But you keep asking for trouble,
You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way.",Jungle,2010

I change in time at least I hope to, cause it feels so right when I hold you,

All I did was say a flow, and now my father's always told
You should play your part, but I never said I'd take the role
Now every fucking thing I say's a quote
And they catch you out a convict, I'd be lying if I said I was not vexed,
Pick up a paper flick a page and see a picture of me on my latest conquest
Fuck it, it all helped
I'm not just gonna stand here making out its all hell
And all's well and good if I put on a pair of rose ticks

Professor Green,"Never needed a hand nope, I did it all alone
With no dad to make a man of me, I did it on my own
A victim, a condition now I'm conditioned for the cold
Even though I know what's missing there's no feeling in this home
Escaped it, a whole leap of problems, isolating instead of facing
I always attract the women who think that I need saving
Even though I'm the only person I can put any faith in
Face it, I'm chained in and happily so,
What would I have to hold it if I let all the anarchy go?
Can't take the praise, I just climb my patrol,
Just know I better deal with hatred and handle it so

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
And I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
(Who's gonna) Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

See what I got in this world?
That's how come I can't sleep without poppin a pill
Felt it come back up but I'm still down,
Just back to convincing myself that I'm ill now
See with me the stress manifest isn't it,
Still in me is this ray of happiness and its killing me
I cant control it yet I worry about things that are out of my control and I'm folded
I ain't never letting this introvert out,
In a lonely home that could have been but isn't our house
But I ain't in the mood to have any visitors round
So I hide away, my curtains been drawn so long
I couldn't tell you if its night or day
So how I feel is the only way that I can hide the pain
People try and help but I shy away but a problem shared is a problem heard
But I care for you too much to make this problem ours
Who knows where this problem starts
Come on Steve and get to mine,
You're not scared it's something I'm man enough to be
Or even you get be, how am I meant to handle what I see
When they just found my daddy hanging from a tree

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

Trying to find myself
I don't know where to go from here
Losing my strength
So save me again

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

So save me again

Been tryin' to disguise it and dress it up,
I wanna tell her but i cant bear to see her welling up

But if I let her go I'll never know if things will get better with her,
See this could be a hiccup and not the end of the road

Nah, it'll never be enough
'Cause I think we both know what it means for us

That's when she spins me around and tells me I ain't leaving

Weren't even writing raps I was down and out about to fucking quit it
Lucky for me that I fucking didn't
See lily came along when I was at my lowest
Selling wraps of coke not the raps I flow with
I made it and I owe to a chat I had with her,
Who knows where I'd be if that chat hadn't occurred
Back with the bag, with the bag full of herbs in it
Instead I got her on a track and I murdered it
My name started causing murmurs in the industry
But none of these labels would work with it until virgin did
Put my first single out and we earned a hit
That's why we never ?
I know it must burn a bit
Just did a show and everybody knew the words to it

My album went in at 2
For a debut not to shabby if I have to I make do
Finally some form of reward for the things I came through
But it's different to the perfect picture people paint you
On the way up you might be a person people take to
Then you break through and the same people who rated you hate too
All of a sudden anything you may do may make news

It's been a strain to remain human amongst all this inhumanity
Thankfully I had nan who was a mum and a dad to me
You can choose your friends but you can't choose your family
Temporary happiness for me has been a fallacy

I just don't know how to be

No more making out to be

Sick of being in the state of vanity
It's agony
Am I torn or is it all some twisted form of vanity
Can it be I'm really just obsessed with myself, 
Obsessive compulsive depressed, my pressures reflecting my health
Taking care of my career but I'm neglecting myself
Rejected therapy no I just won't except any help

To think, I used to blame me,
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me.
I wasn't even bad, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride.
You never even got to see me rap,
I just wish you woulda reached out,
I wish you woulda been round when I been down.
I wish that you could see me now,
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace.
But know that if I ever have kids,
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me.

Everything I have I give to you
In every one of these lines I sing to you.

My life just became yours to read and interpret.
If you heard it will come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things.
You see me smile
Now you're gonna have to see me hurt
Coz pretending everything is alright when it ain't, really isn't working.

I wanna sing, I wanna shout.

Watching a rom com and crying my eyes out

Too busy to reminisce over a time when you have time
And all you wanna do is chill, baby hold onto

A plane I've gotta catch and a bed I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna leave you, I wanna wake you
But I should let you sleep through, you look so peaceful
Tiptoeing as I'm rushing to get my things together
Too many pieces of puzzles for me to piece together
Maybe I'll leave a letter, in the hope that
When she wakes, she remembers me and that we fell asleep together
But likely she remembered nothing
Woke up in a rush and huffing at how Stephen kept her knocking
Grabbed her things, didn't see the letter, let alone open it
Stepped over it on her way out and never even noticed it

At least we did when we were together
All of the things that we did together

Did I expect too much?
Could I have given you a little extra?
Would it have made you a little less of a strut?
And you walk wherever you walk

When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

It's been a while since I last dreamt
Barely remember what it's like to dream
Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed
And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me
Pretend shit doesn't get to me
And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting
A man's problems are his own
And it's my burden
Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep
But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working
I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering
Sick of pretending to be so happy
All the while my anxiety's away at me
My skin crawling, I look up to the sky
And it falls, the walls close in and it's
As if all the good in my life disappears
In an instant, that thing is just so distant
So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me
But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me
It's just me, wish I could let somebody in
But I ain't ever been too trusting

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye

I've barely had any sleep when I get up
Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors
Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better
Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if
It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew
Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?
But the point of things I never have went from
Being a reason for the things that I do
To just being an excuse that I'd use
I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do
Find something other than negativity for my fuel
But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered
I hide everything that's going on inside
Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help
But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine

All the time I have laid in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?

I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK
But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness
Is hard and depression is a slippery slope
I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though
So I carry on even though it's hard to
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change
As long as you give em a chance to

",Go to the Mardi Gras,1991
Professor Longhair,"    (intro) The night was clear, and the moon was yellow
    And the leaves came tumblin' down. . .

    I was standing on a corner
    When I heard my bull dog bark
    He was barking at two men
    Who were gambling in the dark

    It was Stagger Lee and Billy
    Two men who gambled late
    Stagger Lee threw a seven
    Billy swore that he threw eight

    Stagger Lee he told Billy
    ""I can't let you go with that
    You won all o' my money
    And my brand new Stetson hat.""

    Stagger Lee started off walking
    Down that old railroad track
    He turned and told Billy
    ""Don't be here when I come back""

    Then old Stagger Lee, he went home
    And he got his forty-four
    He said ""I'm going down to the barroom
    To pay that debt I owe""

    bridge: Go, Stagger Lee!

    Stagger Lee went to the barroom
    Walked across that barroom floor
    He said, ""Now, nobody move""
    And he pulled out his forty-four

    ""Oh, Stagger Lee,"" cried Billy
    ""Please don't take my life
    I got three little children
    And a very sickly wife""

    Stagger Lee... shot Billy
    Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
    Till the bullet went through Billy
    And it broke the bartender's glass. ",Stagger Lee,1993

It was Stagolee & Billy Lion
Boys, they were gamblin that early day
Yeah, they tossed up that seven
Billy Lion told him the easy way


Stagolee lost all his money
Lost his new cadilac
He said I believe your cheatin'
Don't be here when I get back

Stagolee went home
& he knocked up on his woman's door
He said wake up little Bertha baby 
& hand me my forty-four

You know Bertha rose out of bed screamin
She was lookin him dead smack in the eye
She said come on in honey
I can see some poor man's gonna die

Then Stagolee told Bertha
That he had lost his new cadilic
But he believed Billy was cheatin
& she knew he wouldn't go for that

Stagolee went back on the corner
& stood up in the barroom door
& he said don't nobody move
Cuz I got me my forty-four

Stagolee cried Billy
& he shot the poor boy so fast
The bullet went through Billy
& it broke the bartenders glass

Then Billy Lion started screamin
I heard him say Stagolee don't take my life
You know I got two little children

Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line

Killers go dumb
Usually deatch is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle
Where kidnappers hunt you
The streets they really want you
Serious
No smile on this block gives answers gets per curious
Good times disappears quickly back into a mist
Shoot I hardly ever miss
That means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch
Then pretty soon I have to switch
Scratching the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams ""who next?""
Like my nigga 2-Tech he totes 2-techs.
It been a beef before in Houston they called it ""plex""
They got to know the protocol 
I'm warning y'all
It gets deep
So deep the prison guards will put you to sleep
Rest eternally

Back up against the wall another statistic I know

And mommy is the colleges

If I get busted I'm not about to tell

I ain't trying to do right because I'm already living in hell
Because I'm a gangster

Pay raises too low

Or out somewhere pimpin getting money by the two hoes
That's why I'm in the lab with The Product spittin new flows
Feds watchin my hood entirely too much gunplay
Neighborhood basketball star slained last Monday
Raided the neighborhood kingpin last Tuesday
If this was going on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masses
Low and middles class still carrying bus passes
Young girls giving birth before they hit the 9th grade
About to be a mom and can't even make cool-Aid
Who made this crack anyway?
Told this about this herron 
Sold us to alcohol and the guns that we care-on

[Chorus Z-Ro]

[Scarface]
It's like the ghetto got a heart and a soul
A mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat die before he grown
A lust for a young girl sliding down the pole
She's always falling short on her goals
The street life is cold
It's either when you lose or you fold
Money is the root of all evil is what I was told
And everything that you thought you would leave there is a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons and when the smoke clear
The truth appear
The fight for your life
The struggles of the wrong versuses right
And wrong won
The song sung
In the keys of reality 
When death crosses your path bloodshed tragically
So automatically you come to a close
And realize no matter what the key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow motherfuckers whole
Then shit them out in the system ain't never make it home

I turned my head in defense

We just might implode

Facing you in tears
And in that moment, metal twisted
And you disappeared
