Where the fuck's all these niggas saying Ran' isn't hot
I damage the block
I scramble like Randall with rocks
I'm that nigga in the gambling spot
Cracking jokes and drinking liquor
You still gotta hand me your watch
I'm in the kitchen with the pans and the pots
Razor on the plate, trying to figure out how many grams I'm a chop
Family or not, some niggas making plans with the cops
Trying to figure how to make this animal stop
Who these niggas trying to take down
Break down, tray pound, eight rounds
He ain't feeling nothing from the waist down
Hit up, lit up, he never gonna get up
There's only one legend alive
The rest you gotta dig up
You acting like it's hard roast ya
I'll creep in your crib, and put your brains on your Barkley posters
Got no time to be boxing around
I got the ox and the pound
I'll leave you in the box in the ground
Got the keys to the game, and we locking this down
Underwater with the sharks, and we not gonna drown
Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound
They ain't no stopping us now, my nigga

[Freck Billionaire]
Ya clip trip, clip spit
Get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith and my rich sweats
Player haters talking 'bout they gonna get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than the shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar 'cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got rich like Federline
Fuck a g-pack, I'll show you how to read crack
You get it soft and then you rock it like T-Mac
The weed good price, plus it smoke speci
Three thousand full pound of some Dro Pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers
I'll let my homies spark ya
We in the spurs, that's faster than Tony Parker
This is family nigga don't ever cross my brother
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to god, the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best, hands down, like six-thirty

[Paul Cain]
Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate

Yo
Niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
Need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the bionic six
Who wanna fire, when guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is San-jaya, now who wanna try us
That four-five will spit
I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shade niggas couldn't get a tan from me
Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as his un-tuck BAM
Talking about you touch grams
I'm coming through your window something like +Brother Man+
It's just who we are
If I see yar, it's E.R
Vacay in D.R., shirt and jeans, g-star
Tell me how they gonna manage
Letting off Virgina Techs now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards
Every twenty-four, every half-hour
Niggas be trying to be Jack Bauer
So let fam' keep talking
You gonna need a ""Weekend At Bernie's""

[Red Cafe]
I guess it's left to me, the popcorn slinger, to pop off nigga
Callouses on my pop finger, pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still Keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For for the family, I'll be squeezing, no reason
Blood work, nobody leaving this bitch breathing
Niggas on the low, kidnapped my flow
Coulda asked for it, I woulda gift wrapped my flow
Don't gotta ask for it, I'm gonna sit back the fo'
Flip it around, let the handle crack ya jaw
East-side, west-side, I'll be in my Converse

All they gotta do is chirp
And them things are gonna blis-am
Shake down, fiz-am
Straight from the Brooklyn borough that never riz-an
Block-ay block-ay

[Fabolous]
Now if they get me on wire traces
I'm gonna die in com-stat
I got prior cases from riding with firearms cocked
Fire bomb box, set up by your mom's block
Go off on time, 'cause it's wired by alarm clock
I get his legs, you grab him by arms lock
We gonna go this liar harm while his crying moms watch
Last seen in Brooklyn, they found in a Bronx lot
Rifles on the roof, yeah we got him by a long shot
We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on swat
And if they get me, Brooklyn gonna riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock
'Round here that's better than buying Viacom stock
Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give
I'll make his relative show me where the fella live
Ain't that his baby sis', get up in this Maybe' Miss
Before I pull this curb and start swerving like Baby sis
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors

This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So better not touch a branch on this family tree

And my Mac you can't use for iChat

And my gat is on leg like thigh tap

Some broke niggas who tryna get some youtube views

Major paper cake by the layers

(Tradegy the Intelligent Hoodlum) 

When I made arrest the president  America ate me 

Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me 

They labeled me a prejudice poet 

I'm speaking the truth as I know it 

I hold on but it's hard for me to handle 

Too much lies  corruption and scandal 

Cops want to kill a brother or two 

Who do you call when the gang wears blue 

I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man 

My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger 

I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer 

Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor

In my hand will be the head of your president

Will rise up for a political showdown

I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen 

And knowing his father slowing 

And his mother is hoeing 

And now should he be growing 

He's too young to be sewing 

he should just chill and be flowing 

I know he was being malested and sold 

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts 

In the soul of the youngster 

Is daddy a monster 

That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain 

Drys and open your eyes for the insane

Partindo pratos e bocas com tapas mato essas moscas
Toma! Eu meto lacres com backs derramo frases ataques
Atiro charques nas bases dos meus sotaques
Oxe! Querem entupir nossos fones a repetirem nomes
Reproduzindo seus clones se afastem dos microfones
Trazem um nível baixo
Para singles fracos, astros de cadastros
Não sigo seus rastros, negados padrastos
Cidade negada como madrasta, enteados já não arrasta
Esses órfãos com precatas, basta, ninguém mais empata
Meto meu chapéu de palha sigo pra batalha
Com força agarro a enxada
Se crava em minhas mortalhas
Tive que correr mais que vocês pra alcançar minha vez
Garra com nitidez rigidez me fez monstro camponês
Exerce influência, tendência
Em vivência em crenças destinos
Se assumam são clandestinos se negam não nordestinos
Vergonha do que são, produção sem expressão própria
Se afastem da criação morrerão por que são cópias
Não vejo cabra da peste só carioca e paulista
Só frestyleiro em nordeste não querem ser repentistas
Rejeitam xilogravura o cordel que é literatura
Quem não tem cultura jamais vai saber o que é rapadura
Foram nossas mãos
Que levantaram os concretos os prédios
Os tetos os manifestos, não quero mais intermédios
Eu quero acesso direto às rádios, palcos abertos
Inovar em projetos protestos arremesso fetos
Escuta! A cidade só existe por que viemos antes
Na dor desses retirantes com suor e sangue imigrante
Rapadura eu venho do engenho rasgo os canaviais
Meto o norte nordeste
O povo no topo dos festivais, toma!

Êha! Ei! Nortista agarra essa causa que trouxeste
Nordestino agarra a cultura que te veste
Eu digo norte vocês dizem nordeste
Norte, nordeste
Norte, nordeste

A chama da vela que reza
Direto com santo conversa
Ele te ajuda, te escuta, num canto colada no chão mas sombras mexem
Pedidos e preces viram cera quente
Pedidos e preces viram cera quente

A fé no sufoco da vela abençoada no dia dormido
O fogo já não existe ali saíram do abrigo
São quase nada
A molecada corre e corre, ninguém 'tá triste
A molecada corre e corre, ninguém 'tá

Se tudo move, o prédio é santo
Se é pobre mais pobre fica
Vira bucha de balão ao som de funk
E apertada tua avenida
A cera foi tarrada
Não se admire

Sou coco e faço cocada embolada bolo na hora
Minha fala é a bala de agora é de aurora e de alvorada
Corto o céu da estrada do nada eu faço de tudo
Com a enxada aro esse mundo e no estudo faço morada
Sou doce lá dos engenhos e venho com essa doçura
Contenho poesia pura, a fartura de rima tenho
Desenho nossa cultura por cima e não por de baixo
Tu não sabe o que é isso? Isso é o Rappa e Rapadura

Raph Krauss,"Do you have the time to listen to me whine 
About nothing and everything all at once 
I am one of those 
Melodramatic fools 
Neurotic to the bone 
No doubt about it 

Sometimes I give myself the creeps 
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me 
It all keeps adding up 
I think I'm cracking up 
Am I just paranoid? 
I'm just stoned 

I went to a shrink 
To analyze my dreams 
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down 
I went to a whore 
He said my life's a bore 
And quit my whining cause it's bringing her down

Buscamos el momento
De acariciarnos con soñada pasión

Hoy que la noche es nuestra
Abrázame y si el mundo comienza
O termina que importa a los dos

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Raphael,"Siempre la misma rutina 
Nos vemos por las esquinas 
Evitando el que dirán 
Mi cuerpo no se acostumbra 
A este amor entre penumbras 
Que es mas fuerte que un volcán 

Escondidos de la luna 
No se puede continuar 
Por desgracia o por fortuna 
No te dejare de amar 

Escándalo, es un escándalo 
Escándalo, es un escándalo 
Escándalo, es un escándalo 
Escándalo, es un escándalo 

No me importa que murmuren 
why que mi nombre censuren 
Por todita la ciudad 
Ahora no hay quien me detenga 
Aunque no pare la lengua 
De la alta sociedad 

Este río desbordado 
No se puede controlar 
Si lo nuestro es un pecado 
No dejare de pecar 

Escándalo, es un escándalo 
Escándalo, es un escándalo 
Escándalo, es un escándalo 
Escándalo, es un escándalo 

Vivo mi vida, soy como soy... 

No me interesa que te tome por sorpresa 
Un alma libre siempre he sido yo 
Si tengo ganas hago lo que me da la gana 
Yo soy el que decide sí o no 

Si piensan mal no me tiene preocupado 
De tu lado no me voy a separar 
Pienso diferente, no vivo con la gente 
why mi manera no la voy a cambiar

Raphael,"Dime porque 
Hoy tu mirada vuela 
Atravesando la noche 
Te siento lejos de mi 
Quiero saber porque 

Tu me dirás ""no te preocupes no es nada"" 
Mis pensamientos estaban 
Junto a ti 

Besame 
Ya sabes que por ti lo haría hoy la vida

Y tras la noche tendrás un nuevo amanecer 
Se perderá esa pregunta en el aire 
Y cuando muera la tarde volverá

Raphael,"Sabías que iba a suceder lo que sucede hoy
Y te quedaste en tu rincón sin escucharme
Me di la vuelta y me marché, quién sabe a dónde

Y por las calles me sentí tan solo
Y me perdí de bar en bar buscando alguien
Y estaba ella y le conté todas mis cosas
Y luego me abrazó, y luego me besó
Y luego nos perdimos en la noche
Y fuimos dos

Sabías que iba a suceder lo que sucede hoy
Y nunca te escuché decir ni un te quiero
Y sin embargo esa mujer, me dijo tantos
Y de repente me olvidé de ti

Y me perdí en el azul de su mirada
Y emborraché mi corazón con tantos besos
Y luego amaneció, y luego amaneció
Y vimos apagarse las estrellas

Raphael,"El camino que lleva a belén
Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió
Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su rey,
Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón
Al redentor, al redentor.
Ha nacido en un portal de belén el niño dios.

Yo quisiera poner a tus pies,
Algún presente que te agrade, señor.
Más, tú ya sabes que soy pobre también,
Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor,
Viejo tambor, viejo tambor.
En tu honor frente al portal tocaré,
Con mi tambor.

El camino que lleva a belén,
Yo voy marcando con mi viejo tambor.
Nada mejor hay que yo pueda ofrecer,
Su ronco acento es un canto de amor,
Al redentor, al redentor.
Cuando dios me vio tocando ante el,
Me sonrió.",El Tamborilero,1995

Devoradora de esquelas 
Partos y demás dolores 
Emisora de rumores 
Asiduo en los sepelios

El domingo los caballos 
En los palcos del real

Raphael,"Yo tenía mi vida llena
Había dicha en cualquier rincón
Siempre estaba mi alma abierta
Por si ella pedía amor

Y me de lo que se llevo

Detenedla ya, que es una ladrona, detenedla ya

Que se ha llevado de mi vida todo
Por no dejar no me ha dejado nada

Raphael,"¿Dónde está nuestro amor?
No sé bien cuál fue el error
Y aunque duela la verdad
Nunca tiene vuelta atrás

Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
But and love is overboard

Tú por mí, yo por ti
Intentando descubrir
Que lección se nos paso

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it
Lessons in love, lost without love

Lessons in love, me duele la verdad
Lessons in love, y busco una señal
Lessons in love, me dices que te vas
Lessons in love, y yo no sé olvidar

",Lessons in Love (Pierde el Amor),2001
Raphael,"Se abre una ventana interior
Es una historia de amor que se ha ido
Todo fue un momento, ayer
Hoy que quiero volver te persigo

Necesito lo que tú me das
Necesito verte un día más
Y sólo pienso en ti
Sólo en ti

Ella ya no cree en el amor
Es sólo una diversión, un fracaso
Todo junto a ella es fingir
Y siento ganas de huir a tus brazos

Necesito lo que tú me das
Necesito verte un día más
Y sólo pienso en ti
Sólo en ti

Va pasando el tiempo
Y no sé de lo que fue aquella vez
¿Que ha quedado?
Te habrás olvidado de mí
Mientras vivo por ti obsesionado

Necesito lo que tú me das
Necesito verte un día más
Y sólo pienso en ti
Sólo en ti

C´est la nuit qui descend du bout des comptoirs
Si je t´aime comme je t´aime dans nos bras scellés
C´est l´amour par la grâce des baisers
Si je t´aime, si tu m´aimes contre un bracelet
C´est décidé

C´est la nuit qui descend autour
C´est la nuit de septembre, des hautes tours
Et on tourne et on tourne sur les boulevards
sur l´amour qui revient tôt ou tard
C´ est la vie qui tourne quand les feux sont noirs 
Et qu´on se meurt

Chaque jour, chaque matin
On avance on se tient et la main dans la main
Et on tourne et on tourne on s´attache à nos cou
Et on tourne tout au tour de nos joues
C´est la vie qui tourne, elle va et elle vient
On le sait bien

C'n´est que la fin d´un jour 
Ou est-ce qu´on rentre mon amour
Est-ce qu´on sera ensemble toujours

La tempête nous fait frissonner
C´est le vent c´est le vent qui nous fait marcher

De la vie de la vie on serait passagers",1900,2003

Aux étoiles de papiers
Dans le grand désert
A la file indienne

Dis c'est quand qu'on revient 

Marcher dans les blés lourds
Sur la ligne de front
Au-dessous du volcan
Au-devant des maisons

Dont nul ne revient
Nul ne connaît la fin

Et un homme à la mer

Des qui vous font frissonner
Qui font craquer la peau
Des mots pour calmer l´âme des pauvres
Ou pour piquer aux yeux de petits amoureux
Des mots encore et puis toujours
Heureux ou bien saignants ça dépend du discours
Qui crache à leur foi jusqu´en pleine figure
Pour ne dire rien d´autre qu'un mensonge de plus

Ah si j´avais su
Si j'avais su


Des mots dans les bouches les couloirs du métro
Des mots tout chauds de ce qu´on vient d'nous inventer
Et qu´il va nous en cuire
Qui va nous arriver
Qui raconterons comment on s´est qu´on se ferra bouffer
Des mots des vieux, usés
Des familles
Des mots sur le courage la vie et puis tout çà
Des mots sur le bonheur qui pour une autre fois
Et puisque y´a rien à dire
Fait le nous ton discours
Des mots pour flatter les petits animaux
Qui sont déjà bien bêtes à bouffer du foin
Des mots qu´on dit pour un bon locataire
Une bonne année pour vous, pour la terre entière

Ah si j´avais su
Si j'avais su

Des mots pour la petite fiancée
Celle qu´on aurait pas du laisser tomber
Avec son petit coeur qui rêve sur le pavé
Son petit regard qui sait plus où s'poser

Des mots tout près pour les grands abattoirs

Quand ça monte de partout 
Qu'on se voit faire son trou 

A passer en pionniers 
Et à jouer des coudes 
On voit bien le paysage 
Mais au dernier palier 
Quand la tour s'écroule 
On oublie 
Ce qu'on fait ici

Mais les cow-boys s'allongent 
Devenus veaux

A tirer sur la longue 
Venez chercher venez chercher

Car les derniers s'ront bons derniers

A rester là, assis, comme on en voit des pays
Des villes et des mondes, des hommes ou des bêtes
C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé, qu'ils m'ont réveillé

Me réveillant ce matin, du mal à me lever
De la terre et du ciel, mais je suis pas causant
Me réveillant ce matin, personne pour m'énerver
De la terre et du ciel, pas vraiment pratiquant
Et je me souviens, petit, en bas des jambes, endormi
Et des pierres dans les bras

A rester là, assis, si j'en ai vu du pays
Des hommes ou des bêtes, des villes et des mondes
C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé qu'ils m'ont emmené

Les voilà bien excités tout prêts à me déchirer
Ils ne me trouveront jamais 

Car je m'en vais, moi, rêver des prairies
Des villes et des mondes des hommes ou des bêtes
Tout était rêvé

C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé, qu'ils m'ont réveillé
Car je m'en vais moi rêver des prairies
Rêver des prairies
Et c'est là que j'ai trouvé ma Réalité",La  réalité,2003
Raphael,"On fait des manières, on fait ses manières
Il faut bien le serrer son rêve, le tenir au secret 
On fait des manières et dresser les natures de vice
Il faut bien que je grandisse

Traîné, j´ai donné, envoyé par le fond, 
J´ai donné la patte, j´ai mordu, dessiné des maisons, 
Je peux descendre du train en marche

Et suivez la musique Suivez la musique
Au peuple de vitesse pour garder la tête haute
Suivez la musique Je crois c´est pareil chez les autres

Tu avais promis tu avais promis de laisser la lumière 
Accroché au radiateur les ombres de la terre
Mais tout passe tout passe circulez Y a rien à voir

J´ai grandi trop vite et sans faire de manières
A l´ombre des géants verts
Et des secrets trop lourds qu'on porte comme on porte en terre
Avec ce que j´ai vu
Avec c'que j´ai rien dit
Il faut bien qu´on me punisse

J´ai prié pour les héros pour le drapeau 
Avalé la dragée du bon Jésus j´ai tout fait comme prévu
J'ai repris le dessus

Et suivez la musique Suivez la musique
Au peuple de vitesse pour garder la tête haute
Suivez la musique Tu seras un homme mon fils

Tu avais promis tu avais promis de laisser la lumière 
Accroché au radiateur les ombres de la terre
Tu avais promis tu avais promis
Garder la tête haute et dresser les natures des vices
Il faut bien que je grandisse",Suivez La Musique,2003
Raphael,"Sur la mappemonde à vol d'oiseau
On se dit qu'on peut gagner gros
Qu'on a le ciel dans une goutte d'eau
On cherche tous un bon destin
La vie s'écoule entre nos mains
La joie la peine notre chemin
Traverser la vie sans billet de train
Traverser la vie sans billet de train

Sur la route. dala dala lalalala

La solitude la mauvaiseté
Ça fait rêver la liberté
Jurer qu'on ne s'ennuiera pas
Quand on aura du bien, tu vois
Et ce bonheur qui nous traverse
Pour un simple morceau de pain
Si tu as faim prends le mien

Si c'est pas l'Amérique
Ça y ressemble bien

Des fois j'aimerais être un oiseau
Pour pouvoir cracher de plus haut
Voir les maisons et les campagnes
Et mieux leur tourner le dos
On ira vendre nos sacs de roses
On prendra le train du matin
Sur tous les murs y aura écrit
De la justice pas la vengeance
De la justice pas la vengeance

Sur la route",Sur la route,2003
Raphael,"Il y a toujours des gens qui s'aiment 
Et qui se retrouvent sur le quai 
Ou l'on s'embrasse 
Mais comme tu m'as manqué 
D'autres qui ne savent ou aller 

Il y a toujours un air d'orage 
Et jours de pluie et jours mauvais 
Juste une seconde pour t'enlacer 
Et je te regarde passer 

La-bas La-bas 

Il y a toujours des rues en rouge 
Et des campagnes de rage 
Et de l'amours toujours blessé 
Et des enfants pour caresser 

Il y a toujours une fanfare 
Il y a toujours quelqu'un qui part 
Dans les maisons dans les gares 
Des avions qui n'arrivent jamais 

La-bas La-bas 

Au siecle des fumées 
Qu'il est loin le pays du lait et du miel 
Jamais j'y arriverais sans toi 
La-bas La-bas

Raphael,"Somos un sueño imposible
Que busca la noche
Para olvidarse del tiempo
Why de tanto reproche

Somos en nuestra quimera
Doliente why querida
Dos hojas que el viento
Junto en el otoño ¡Ay!

Somos dos seres en uno
Que amando se mueren
Para guardar en secreto
Lo mucho que quieren

Pero, ¿qué importa la vida
Con esta separación?
Somos dos gotas de llanto
En una canción

Somos un sueño imposible
Que busca la noche
Para olvidarse del tiempo
Why de tanto reproche

Somos en nuestra quimera
Doliente why querida
Dos hojas que el viento
Junto en el otoño ¡Ay!

Somos dos seres en uno
Que amando se mueren
Para guardar en secreto
Lo mucho que quieren

Con esta separación?

Raphael,"Se me va 
Este amor que he ido amasando con mis manos se me va 
Se me va 
Lo que tanto tiempo yo he querido tanto se me va 
No hay razón 
Que yo pierda en un momento lo que tanto me costó 
No hay razón 
Que se vaya de mis manos en un soplo tanto amor 
Se me va 
Como el agua que se escurre de las manos se me va 
Como el aire que no puede sujetarlo 
Como el tiempo que implacable va pasando 
Como el humo tu cariño se me va 

Se me va 
Y no puedo ya luchar por retenerlo 
Este amor en realidad se ha ido muriendo 
Y por eso de mis manos se me va 
Dónde irán 
Esos días de alegrías que pasamos, dónde irán 
Dónde irán 
Esas miles de caricias que inventamos, dónde irán 
Ya lo sé 
Que en la vida nunca hay nada para siempre, ya lo sé 
Pero fue tan bonito así quererte que ahora me cuesta perderte",Se Me Va,2005
Raphael,"Cómo han pasado los años
Cómo cambiaron las cosas
Y aquí estamos lado a lado
Como dos enamorados
Como la primera vez

Cómo han pasado los años
Qué mundo tan diferentes
Y aquí estamos frente a frente
Como dos adolescentes
Que se miran sin hablar

Si parece que fue anoche
Que bailamos abrazados
Y juramos un ""te quiero""
Que nos dimos por entero
Y en secreto murmuramos
""Nada nos va a separar""

Cómo han pasado los años
Las vueltas que dio la vida
Nuestro amor siguió creciendo
Y con él, nos fue envolviendo
Habrán pasado los años
Pero el tiempo no ha podido
Hacer que pase lo nuestro

Si parece que fue anoche
Que bailamos abrazados
Y juramos un ""te quiero""
Que nos vimos por entero
Y en secreto murmuramos
""Nada nos va a separar""

Raphael,"Han nacido en mi rancho dos arbolitos, 
Dos arbolitos que parecen gemelos, 
Y desde mi casita los veo solitos, 
Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo. 

Nunca están separados uno del otro, 
Porque así quiso Dios que los dos nacieran, 
Y con sus mismas ramas se hacen caricias, 
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran. 

Arbolito, arbolito, bajo tu sombra, 
Voy a esperar que el día cansado vuelva, 
Y cuando estoy solito, mirando al cielo, 
Pido pa' que me mande una compañera. 

Arbolito, arbolito, 
Me siento solo, 
Quiero que me acompañes, 
Hasta que muera.",Dos Arbolitos,2008
Raphael,"Todo pasa y todo queda
Pero lo nuestro es pasar
Pasar haciendo caminos
Caminos sobre la mar

Nunca perseguí la gloria
Ni dejar en la memoria 
De los hombres mi canción
Yo amo los mundos sutiles
Ingrávidos y gentiles
Como pompas de jabón

Me gusta verlos pintarse 
De sol y grana, volar 
Bajo el cielo azul, temblar 
Súbitamente y quebrarse

Nunca perseguí la gloria

Caminante, son tus huellas 
El camino y nada más
Caminante, no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar

Al andar se hace camino 
Y al volver la vista atrás 
Se ve la senda que nunca 
Se ha de volver a pisar

Caminante no hay camino 
Sino estelas en la mar

Hace algún tiempo en ese lugar 
Donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos 
Se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Murió el poeta lejos del hogar
Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino
Al alejarse le vieron llorar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar
Cuando el poeta es un peregrino
Cuando de nada nos sirve rezar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso",Cantares,2008
Raphael,"Mírame
En nada me consigo concentrar
Ando despistado todo lo hago mal
Soy un desastre y no sé
Que está pasando
Me gustas a rabiar yo te deseo
Me llegas a desesperar
Es tan grande lo que siento por ti
Que tenerte no bastará
Que esto que me invita a vivir
Que me da la ilusión
Que será esa fuerza
Que a todos nos une de dos en dos
Será la fuerza del corazón

Hace que
Te abrace y los cuerpos lleguen a estorbar
Tiemblo sólo con la idea de rozar
Tus labios llenos de besos nuevos
No puedo dormir robas mi tranquilidad
Alguien ha bordado
Tu cuerpo con hilos de mi ansiedad
De cinturón tus piernas cruzadas
De mi espalda un reloj
Donde tus dedos son las agujas
Se dan cuerda a este motor
Que es la fuerza del corazón

Y es la fuerza que te lleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento casi una obsesión
Si la fuerza es del corazón
Es algo que te lía la descarga de energía
Que te va quitando la razón
Te hace tropezar te crea confusión
Seguro que es la fuerza del corazón
Es la fuerza que te lleva

No puedo pensar
Tendría que cuidarme más
Como poco pierdo la vida y luego me la das
Que es lo que va cegando al amante
Que va por ahí de señor
Y no es mas que un chiquillo travieso
Provocador será la fuerza del corazón

Y es la fuerza que te lleva
Que te empuja y que te llena

Raphael,"Me calaste hondo
Y ahora me dueles
Si todo lo que nace perece, del mismo modo
Un momento se va
Y no vuelve a pasar

Y decían: ""¡qué bonito!"" era vernos pasear
Queriéndonos infinito
Pensaban: ""siempre será igual""
¿Cómo lo permitimos, qué es lo que hicimos tan mal?
¿Fue este orgullo desgraciado
Que no supimos tragar?
Engáñame un poco al menos
Dí que me quieres aún más
Que durante todo este tiempo
Lo has pasado fatal
Que ninguno de esos idiotas te supieron hacer reír
Que el único que te importa
Es este pobre infeliz

Me calaste hondo
Y ahora me dueles
Si todo lo que nace perece, del mismo modo
Un momento se va
Y no vuelve a pasar

Y el día que yo me muera y moriré antes que tú
Sólo quiero que una pena
Se lloré frente a mi ataúd
Que esta herida en mi alma no llegó a cicatrizar
Y estará desesperada
Hasta que te vea llegar

Me calaste hondo
Y ahora me dueles
Si todo lo que nace perece, del mismo modo
Un momento se va
Y no vuelve a pasar
Un momento de va
Y no vuelve a pasar
Un momento se va",Infinito,2008

Que yo sin tu amor.. me muero

Despacio y en silencio sin saber
Si todo lo que he dado te llego a tiempo

y no tener un nombre
Que decirle al viento

Raphael,"Siento tu mano fría 
correr despacio sobre mi piel, 
why tu pecho en mi pecho why tu desnudez. 
Ya olvido reproches que imaginé. 

Vente conmigo al huerto 
que están las rosas 
queriendo ver la promesa 
que has roto para volver 
why así creer lo que les conté. 

Dije que te quería 
como a nada en el mundo. 
Que seguía tus pasos, 
tu caminar, como un lobo en celo 
desde mi hogar 
con la puerta abierta de par en par, 
de par en par. 

Que tenía en penumbra 
nuestro rincón 
en aquel salón con dos cubiertos 
why tu canción 
why con tus flores en el jarrón. 

Siento tu mano tibia 
que palmo a palmo besa mi piel 
why tus brazos me enredan hoy como ayer; 
en este nuevo día vuelvo a creer. 

Vente conmigo al puerto 
que hay una barca en el malecón 
con tu nombre pintado secando al sol, 
con tu mano grabada junto al timón. 

Sabes que te quería 
como a nada en el mundo… 

Que tenía en penumbras 
nuestro rincón… 

Quiero abrazarte tanto 
con mis sentidos, con tanto amor 
que no haya más sonido que nuestra voz 
mi cuerpo en el tuyo a continuación. 

why yo andaré la tierra 
como un romero buscando a un dios 
why tendré tu regazo, tu comprensión 
why una casa pequeña para los dos.

En el vació de estos días de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz

Volverte a ver para poderme reponer

Où je me remets doucement
De mon accident,

Et les petites infirmières

Et les petits plats, hum, t´y croirais pas
Et dès que je pourrai marcher
J´irai à la fenêtre
Prendre les premiers rayons du printemps

Mon vieux copain, j´ai essayé d´imaginer
A quoi pouvait ressembler cette ville il y a mille ans
Avant les périphériques, les publicités, et tout ça, 
C´était sûrement très bien

J´imagine qu´il y avait des champs et du vent et des étoiles
Je me réjouis de te revoir, de te parler, 
De faire bouger ce vrai pantin de bois
Depuis quelques semaines, les peupliers se répondent dans la cour

Du sommeil il m´en faut pas plus, 
Dès que je pourrai marcher, nous serons loin, 
Le désert sibérien, où tu voudras
Et je laisse la ville et ses rumeurs au milieu du lit défait,

Quand ils me ramènent à la maison

Et penser à ceux qui sont tombés

J´ n´ai pas vraiment souvenir de quand je roulais sous la table
Je baisse la vitre, je laisse la nuit entrer
Laisse-moi fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse
Laisse-moi au moins essayer
Laisse-moi au moins essayer

J´aime bien le cinéma quand c´est toi qui racontes la fin
Quand tu dis du bout des lèvres, quand tu me laves les cheveux
Quand tu crois que tout va bien
Que tu chasses la peur dans mes mains

Le temps des Gainsbourg des Prévert
Je revois tes cheveux défaits
Dans la chambre d´hôtel tu jouais
Et moi sur la banquette arrière
Je voyais le monde à l´envers

Que vive le vent de l'hiver
et tout retourne à la terre

dans le rétroviseur

Le temps du soleil tatoué
C´était le temps des avalanches
Le temps des verres bus et cassés
Ma vie brûlait comme la place rouge
Quand la nuit finissait sa course

C´était le temps des accords majeurs
Où tout était illuminé
Et j´entends battre ton coeur
Doucement doucement
Je ne suis pas soigné
C´était le temps de la Cantate
Le temps où tu la jouais pour moi

Raphael,"Yo sigo siendo aquel 
A pesar de las dudas 
Y mi eterna locura 
Yo sigo siendo aquel 

Eterno caminante 
Que vive en cualquier parte 
Y muere cada noche 
Un poco 

Que vuelve a equivocarse 
Y vuelve a levantarse 
Y que ama con la fuerza 
De un loco 

Yo sigo siendo aquel 
Que cuando muere el sol 
La echa de menos 
Yo sigo siendo aquel 
Que va dejando el alma entre sus besos 
Yo sigo siendo aquel 
Que mira cada noche las estrellas 
Y siempre les pregunto 
Igual que tantas veces 
Si esta durmiendo ella 

Yo sigo siendo aquel 
A pesar del silencio 
Del aplauso y el beso 
Yo sigo siendo aquel 
Eterno solitario 
Detras de un escenario 
Y propiedad un poco de todos 

Que vuelve a equivocarse 
Y vuelve a levantarse 
Y que ama con la fuerza 
De un loco 

Yo sigo siendo aquel

En el borde de su entrada,
Por favor,
Y que algo le escribiera
De esa apasionada letra,
Por favor,
Donde dice usted que ama
Con la fuerza de los mares,
Con el ímpetu del viento,
Con su alma y con su carne…
Cómo no, querida amiga,
Cuanto quieras, cuanto pidas
Mal de amores ya tan joven,
A pesar de esa belleza,
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?

Me pareces algo aparte,
Si me esperas que me cambie,
Por favor,
Por ahí nos perderemos
Para hablar y conocernos,
Por favor
Y en un bar de poca monta,
Un lugar de carretera
De intercambio de parejas
E interiores con alcobas;
Entre música y penumbra,
Baile y humo, charla y copa,
Nos pasaron muchas horas
Hasta ver amanecer
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?

Al salir de aquella cueva,
Ya con luz de la mañana,
Ya sin rimmel que enmascara,
Al besarla me di cuenta
Que esa diosa, que ese cielo,
Que esa luna era lucero
Me callé, no dije nada
Y al partir me pregunté,
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?
Y esa piel de canela, de bronce, de miel?

Deshojando margaritas

Con la variedad de verdes
Con las hojas que se mueven 
Al capricho de la brisa 
Plateadas por el sol

En las noches frías de invierno
Yo su apoyo, su pañuelo
Su cobija, su edredón

Pero nunca se le olvida 
Que es juguete de la vida 
Y sin más desaparece 
Y se me enreda por ahí

Tu recuerdo vive en mi 
Puedo sentirte a mi lado 

Soy tuyo, soy el reflejo de tu amor 
Hecho de ti, de tus besos 

Soy tuyo, soy, sin 
Sin distancia sin razón 
Puedo sentirte en mis huesos 

Porque me amas me vuelvo por ti la mejor de mi 

Porque te amo te quiero vivir del principio hasta el fin 
Del principio hasta el fin 
Del principio hasta el fin",Del Principio Hasta El Fin,2016
Raphael,"Esta vez sí 
Habrá fiesta en el palacio 
De las caras largas 
Que no creen en nada 

Esta vez sí 
Llenaremos la habitaciones del hotel 
Con invitados 
Esta vez no explotamos, esta vez 
Habéis ganado 

Celebraremos infinitas veces 
Que aun queda tiempo para reparar, nuestros desastres 
Celebraremos infinitos bailes 
En las cuatro paredes, que encierran aire 

Esta vez no, no conquistaremos imperios 
Reforzaremos los muros de contención 
Esta vez no, no se desvelara el secreto 
Cristalizar las uniones, los puentes entre los dos 
Esta vez, habéis ganado 

Celebraremos infinitas veces 
Que aun queda tiempo para 
Reparar nuestros desastres 
Celebraremos infinito bailes 
En las cuatro paredes que encierran aire 

Que aun queda 
Tiempo para reparar 
Nuestros desastres 
Celebraremos infinitos bailes",Infinitos Bailes,2016
Raphael,"Tu me dis que tu l'aimes
Je sais, oui tu dis vrai
Et pourtant moi je t'aime
Bien plus fort en secret
Un matin quand il partira
Quand tu pleureras
Dis-toi bien que tu vivais
Tes tendres années

Dans tes yeux la lumière
N'est là que pour lui
Le sais-tu? La lumière
Ça n'est pas infini
De ne voir en lui qu'un espoir au jour des regrets
Dis-toi bien que tu vivais
Tes tendres années

Si mon cœur ne peut être
Pour toi le premier
J'attendrai afin d'être
Dans ta vie le dernier
Je serai dans ton avenir
Loin des souvenirs
Pour te faire oublier
Tes tendres années

Oui, je serai dans ton avenir
Loin des souvenirs
Pour te faire oublier

Raphaël,"Des mots des grands mots des tous beaux
Des qui vous font frissonner
Qui font craquer la peau
Des mots pour calmer l´âme des pauvres
Ou pour piquer aux yeux de petits amoureux
Des mots encore et puis toujours
Heureux ou bien saignants ça dépend du discours
Qui crache à leur foi jusqu´en pleine figure
Pour ne dire rien d´autre qu'un mensonge de plus

Ah si j´avais su
Si j'avais su


Des mots dans les bouches les couloirs du métro
Des mots tout chauds de ce qu´on vient d'nous inventer
Et qu´il va nous en cuire
Qui va nous arriver
Qui raconterons comment on s´est qu´on se ferra bouffer
Des mots des vieux, usés
Des familles
Des mots sur le courage la vie et puis tout çà
Des mots sur le bonheur qui pour une autre fois
Et puisque y´a rien à dire
Fait le nous ton discours
Des mots pour flatter les petits animaux
Qui sont déjà bien bêtes à bouffer du foin
Des mots qu´on dit pour un bon locataire
Une bonne année pour vous, pour la terre entière

Ah si j´avais su
Si j'avais su

Des mots pour la petite fiancée
Celle qu´on aurait pas du laisser tomber
Avec son petit coeur qui rêve sur le pavé
Son petit regard qui sait plus où s'poser
Des mots pour la vente générale
Des mots encore en bouillis ou bien en drame
Des mots tout près pour les grands abattoirs
Et puiqu´il est bien mort fais- le nous ton discours
Des mots par pleines charrettes
Des mots par plein de paquets pour nous rassurer

Je ne me batterai plus
Je ne me batterai plus",Des Mots,2004
Raphaël,"Il ira loin
il ira loin celui-là
Peut etre bien jusqu'au bout
Au bout de ses rêves
Mais sur le bout des lèvres 
Reste le mauvais goût 
Monter en grade monter en graine
Et le mal qu'on se donne 
Quand ça monte de partout 
Qu'on se voit faire son trou 

A passer en pionniers 
Et à jouer des coudes 
On voit bien le paysage 
Mais au dernier palier 
Quand la tour s'écroule 
On oublie 
Ce qu'on fait ici 

Le rodéo ne s'arrête jamais 
Mais les cow-boys s'allongent 
Devenus veaux 
Et bien appliqués 
A tirer sur la longue 
Venez chercher venez chercher 
Les visas pour le rêve 
Car les derniers s'ront bons derniers 
Quinze mille pieds sous les bombes 

Les présidents-robots ont donné le signal 
C'est l'heure du passage 
Dans les peuples endormis du bout de la semaine 
On oublie 
De quoi il s'agit 

Il ira loin, 
il ira loin celui là 
Mais qu'il y aille sans moi 
Il ira loin, 
il ira loin celui là 
Mais qu'il y aille sans moi",Il Ira Loin,2004
Raphaël,"Je suis jamais vraiment été allé à l'école
J'ai fait mon tour et puis c'était marre
Et ma vision du monde je la cherchais dans leur yeux
Mais j'ai rien vu j'ai rien vu du tout
J'ai sonné la retraite et j'ai sonné l'hallali
Et des anges avec leurs trompettes
M'ont cloué au lit
Des mouches et des famines
Là dans ma chambre froide
Je crois j'étais malade

A rester là, assis, comme on en voit des pays
Des villes et des mondes, des hommes ou des bêtes
C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé, qu'ils m'ont réveillé

Me réveillant ce matin, du mal à me lever
De la terre et du ciel, mais je suis pas causant
Me réveillant ce matin, personne pour m'énerver
De la terre et du ciel, pas vraiment pratiquant
Et je me souviens, petit, en bas des jambes, endormi
Et des pierres dans les bras

A rester là, assis, si j'en ai vu du pays
Des hommes ou des bêtes, des villes et des mondes
C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé qu'ils m'ont emmené

Les voilà bien excités tout prêts à me déchirer
Ils ne me trouveront jamais 

Car je m'en vais, moi, rêver des prairies
Des villes et des mondes des hommes ou des bêtes
Tout était rêvé

C'est comme ça qu'ils m'ont trouvé, qu'ils m'ont réveillé
Car je m'en vais moi rêver des prairies
Rêver des prairies
Et c'est là que j'ai trouvé ma Réalité",La Réalité,2004
Raphaël,"On fait des manières, on fait ses manières
Il faut bien le serrer son rêve, le tenir au secret 
On fait des manières et dresser les natures de vice
Il faut bien que je grandisse

Traîné, j´ai donné, envoyé par le fond, 
J´ai donné la patte, j´ai mordu, dessiné des maisons, 
Je peux descendre du train en marche

Et suivez la musique Suivez la musique
Au peuple de vitesse pour garder la tête haute
Suivez la musique Je crois c´est pareil chez les autres

Tu avais promis tu avais promis de laisser la lumière 
Accroché au radiateur les ombres de la terre
Mais tout passe tout passe circulez Y a rien à voir

J´ai grandi trop vite et sans faire de manières
A l´ombre des géants verts
Et des secrets trop lourds qu'on porte comme on porte en terre
Avec ce que j´ai vu
Avec c'que j´ai rien dit
Il faut bien qu´on me punisse

J´ai prié pour les héros pour le drapeau 
Avalé la dragée du bon Jésus j´ai tout fait comme prévu
J'ai repris le dessus

Et suivez la musique Suivez la musique
Au peuple de vitesse pour garder la tête haute
Suivez la musique Tu seras un homme mon fils

Tu avais promis tu avais promis de laisser la lumière 
Accroché au radiateur les ombres de la terre
Tu avais promis tu avais promis
Garder la tête haute et dresser les natures des vices
Il faut bien que je grandisse",Suivez La Musique,2004
Raphaël,"C´est la nuit accoudé au bar
C´est la nuit qui descend du bout des comptoirs
Si je t´aime comme je t´aime dans nos bras scellés
C´est l´amour par la grâce des baisers
Si je t´aime, si tu m´aimes contre un bracelet
C´est décidé

C´est la nuit qui descend autour
C´est la nuit de septembre, des hautes tours
Et on tourne et on tourne sur les boulevards
sur l´amour qui revient tôt ou tard
C´ est la vie qui tourne quand les feux sont noirs 
Et qu´on se meurt

Chaque jour, chaque matin
On avance on se tient et la main dans la main
Et on tourne et on tourne on s´attache à nos cou
Et on tourne tout au tour de nos joues
C´est la vie qui tourne, elle va et elle vient
On le sait bien

C'n´est que la fin d´un jour 
Ou est-ce qu´on rentre mon amour
Est-ce qu´on sera ensemble toujours

La tempête nous fait frissonner
C´est le vent c´est le vent qui nous fait marcher
Mais la nuit mais la nuit n´en finit donc jamais
Comme elle tourne continue à se moquer
De la vie de la vie on serait passagers",1900,2006
Raphaël,"Est-ce que j'en ai les larmes aux yeux
Que nos mains ne tiennent plus ensemble
Moi aussi je tremble un peu
Est-ce que je ne vais plus attendre

Est-ce qu'on va reprendre la route,
Est-ce que nous sommes proches de la nuit
Est-ce que ce monde a le vertige
Est-ce qu'on sera un jour puni

Est-ce que je rampe comme un enfant
Est-ce que je n'ai plus de chemise
C'est le Bon Dieu qui nous fait
C'est le Bon Dieu qui nous brise

Est-ce que rien ne peut arriver
Puis qu'il faut qu'il y ait une justice
Je suis né dans cette caravane
Et nous partons allez viens
Allez viens

Et parce que ma peau est la seule que j'ai
Que bientôt mes os seront dans le vent

Raphaël,"Et toi j'te connais pas mais t'es plus ma copine 
Et tous les jours et les semaines 
Et tu me fais vraiment de la peine non 
Regarde les autres comme ils s'aiment 
Et moi je connais un bon coin 
Où on pourrait s'embrasser 
Et je te veux rien, allez viens 

Et la vie va grand train de l'autre côté 
C'est pas ma faute à moi si je sais pas gagner 
Regarde comment j' dors plus la nuit 
Je sais même plus mon nom 
Et c'est quoi cette petite vie 
Et c'est quoi toutes ces maisons 
Où ils s'en vont 
Où ils s'en vont 

Et l'autre fois je te croise dans la rue 
Et tu me dis même pas bonjour 
Et je sais je fume trop au café je meurs tous les jours 
Et tous les jours de l'année 
C'est la nuit qui vous prend 
Est-ce que tu sens le vide sous nos pieds 
Est-ce que ce vide là tu le sens 
Quand je t'embrasse 
Quand je t'embrasse 

Alors saute-moi au cou 
Allez dis-moi que la vie est belle 
Allez saute moi au cou 
Que c'est pas dans cette vie que l'on paye 
Et cette musique je l'aime beaucoup 
On n'a pas l' même âge mais c'est pareil 
On ira tous les deux jusqu'au bout 
On ira tous les deux jusqu'au bout 
Je sais qu' tu m'aimes 
Ça je l' sais que tu m'aimes",Chanson pour Patrick Dewaere,2006
Raphaël,"Et dans 150 ans, on s'en souviendra pas
De ta première ride, de nos mauvais choix
De la vie qui nous baise, de tous ces marchands d'armes
Des types qui votent les lois là bas au gouvernement
De ce monde qui pousse, de ce monde qui crie
Du temps qui avance, de la mélancolie
La chaleur des baisers et cette pluie qui coule
Et de l'amour blessé et de tout ce qu'on nous roule
Alors souris

Dans 150 ans, on s'en souviendra pas
De la vieillesse qui prend, de leurs signes de croix
De l'enfant qui se meurt, des vallées do tiers monde
Du salaud de chasseur qui descend la colombe
De ce que t'étais belle, et des rives arrachées
Des années sans sommeil, 100 millions de femmes et
Des portes qui se referment de t'avoir vue pleurer
De la course solennelle qui condamne sans ciller
Alors souris

Et dans 150 ans, on n'y pensera même plus
A ce qu'on a aimé, à ce qu'on a perdu
Allez vidons nos bières pour les voleurs des rues!
Finir tous dans la terre, mon dieu! Quelle déconvenue
Et regarde ces squelettes qui nous regardent de travers
Et ne fais pas la tête, ne leur fais pas la guerre
Il leur restera rien de nous, pas plus que d'eux
J'en mettrais bien ma main à couper ou au feu
Alors souris

Et dans 150 ans, mon amour, toi et moi
On sera doucement, dansant, deux oiseaux sur la croix
Dans ce bal des classés, encore je vois large
P't'être qu'on sera repassés dans un très proche, un naufrage
Mais y a rien d'autre à dire, je veux rien te faire croire
Mon amour, mon amour, j'aurai le mal de toi
Mais why a rien d'autre à dire, je veux rien te faire croire
Mon amour, mon amour, j'aurai le mal de toi
Mais que veux-tu?",Et dans 150 Ans,2006
Raphaël,"Pourquoi le temps qui passe
Nous dévisage et puis nous casse
Pourquoi tu restes pas avec moi
Pourquoi tu t´en vas
Pourquoi la vie et les bateaux
Qui vont sur l´eau ont-ils des ailes
Pourquoi les avions s´envolent
Bien plus haut que les oiseaux
Pourquoi que les étoiles
Sont-elles là-haut suspendues
Pourquoi le ciel est si haut
Pourquoi alors

Et un autre jour s´en va
Tourne et tourne et ne s´arrête pas
Et un autre jour s´en va
Dans cette petite vie
Je voudrais pas crever d´ennui

Regarde le vent emporte tout,
Même ce qu´il y a de plus beau
Et les sourires et les enfants
Avec les petites bateaux
Pourquoi même
Les nuages veulent pas rester ici
Si j´étais eux je marcherais vite
Je ferais pas d´économies

Tourne et tourne et ne s´arrête pas
Et un autre jour s´en va

Je voudrais pas crever d´ennui",Les Petits Bateaux,2006

Rêver de pur-sang 
Mais on est dans le dur 
Pour cette vie c'est sûr 
Et après 
Et après 
Qui sait 

La peau sur les os 
et la croix dans le dos 
et des routes de nuit 
et des gens blanchis 
et des rêves 
Mais qu'on en crève 
Et pour rien 
Puisque tout tient 
Dans la main 

Je me suis réveillé ce matin 
Pour la rose d'un jardin 
Au coeur humain 
Encore humain

Comme on revient

Raphaël,"Je suis parti d'un bout du monde
J'étais trop grand pour me courber
Parmi les nuages de poussière

Et même que le vent nous écoute
Et la pluie va tomber bientôt

Ce que j'fais là moi
Je sais pas
Je voulais juste marcher tout droit
Ce que j'fais là moi
Je sais pas
Je pense à toi depuis mille ans

Tellement de nuits sous la paupière
Tellement de forêts abattues
Même sous la mitraille et le fer

Et que même dans l'espace Shengen
Ils ont pas voulu de ma peau

Ce que j'fais là moi
Je sais pas
Je voulais juste marcher tout droit
Ce que j'fais là moi
Je sais pas
Je pense à toi depuis mille ans

C'est pas la croix pas la manière
Et puis la terre on y revient
Moi j'ai un orgue de barbarie
Et je vais pourrir leur pays
C'est pas avec la bombe atomique
C'est pas avec le tour de France
Qu'ils me mettront de leur côté
Quand j'aurai fini ma croissance

Raphaël,"Sur la mappemonde à vol d'oiseau 
On se dit qu'on peut gagner gros 
Qu'on a le ciel dans une goutte d'eau

La joie la peine notre chemin 
Traverser la vie sans billet de train 
Traverser la vie sans billet de train 

Sur la route

La solitude la mauvaiseté 
Ça fait rêver la liberté 
Jurer qu'on ne s'ennuiera pas 
Quand on aura du bien, tu vois 
Et ce bonheur qui nous traverse 
Pour un simple morceau de pain 
Si tu as faim prends le mien 

Si c'est pas l'Amérique 
Ça y ressemble bien 

Des fois j'aimerais être un oiseau 
Pour pouvoir cracher de plus haut 
Voir les maisons et les campagnes 
Et mieux leur tourner le dos

On prendra le train du matin 
Sur tous les murs y'aura écrit 
De la justice pas la vengeance 
De la justice pas la vengeance

Raphaël,"Longtemps sur les chemins
La nuit est encore loin
Marcher jusqu'à user
Voyager sans billet
Un œil à la lucarne
La grande ville
Et défiler les rêves
Le soleil dans les reins
Les voilures gonflées
La rumeur des quartiers
Aux étoiles de papiers
Dans le grand désert
A la file indienne

Comme un homme à la mer
Allez  Dis- la nous ta prière
Et allons plus loin mon frère

Dis c'est quand qu'on revient 

Marcher dans les blés lourds
Sur la ligne de front
Au-dessous du volcan
Au-devant des maisons
Mon amie, mon amour
C'est le grand bond en avant
Dont nul ne revient
Nul ne connaît la fin

Et un homme à la mer
Allez  Dis la nous ta prière
Et allons plus loin mon frère

Dis c'est quand qu'on revient 

Tous les équipages
Fini le voyage
Morts d'insomnie
Dans la nuit de garde
Si jamais je m'égare

Et un homme à la mer
Comme un homme à la mer
Comme un homme à la mer
Allez  Dis la nous ta prière
On est bien amers",Comme un Homme a la Mer,2006
Raphaël,"Il y a toujours des gens qui s'aiment 
Et qui se retrouvent sur le quai 
Ou l'on s'embrasse 
Mais comme tu m'as manqué 
D'autres qui ne savent ou aller 

Il y a toujours un air d'orage 
Et jours de pluie et jours mauvais 
Juste une seconde pour t'enlacer 
Et je te regarde passer 

La-bas La-bas 

Il y a toujours des rues en rouge 
Et des campagnes de rage 
Et de l'amours toujours blessé 
Et des enfants pour caresser 

Il y a toujours une fanfare 
Il y a toujours quelqu'un qui part 
Dans les maisons dans les gares 
Des avions qui n'arrivent jamais 

La-bas La-bas 

Au siecle des fumées 
Qu'il est loin le pays du lait et du miel 
Jamais j'y arriverais sans toi 
La-bas La-bas

Nan, tu vois pas.

Tu n’es pas dans l’ombre,
Pas dans le triangle.

Comme quand tu faisais du zèle,
Comme quand je te volais dans les plumes,
Entre les dunes.
Par la porte entrebâillée,
Je te vois rêver,
A des ébats qui me blesse,
A des ébats qui ne cesse.

Peu à peu tout me happe,
Je me dérobe, je me détache,
Sans laissé d’auréoles,
Les cymbales, les symboles
Colle, on se rappelle, on se recolle.
Peu à peu tout me happe.

Le vent de l’orgueil,
Peut apaiser
Peut apaiser
Une poussière dans l’œil,
Et le monde entier soudain se trouble.

Comme quand tu faisais du zèle,
Comme quand je te volais dans les plumes,
Entre les dunes.
Par la porte entrebâillée,
Je te vois rêver,
Des romans fleurs asséchées,
Où Jadis on nageait.

Peu à peu tout me happe,
Je me dérobe, je me détache,

Lorsque je suis tombé dans un océan bleu
Je dors dans un écrin, la joue sur une hélice

J´aimerais dormir sur ses nattes
A l´abri des paravents
Lire mon avenir dans ses cartes
Tant qu´il est encore temps
Le soir, au fond de sa jonque

Où je la vois qui s´éloigne

Où je me remets doucement
De mon accident, 
Transformer ma chambre en cargo

En pique-nique dingue
Les fêtes de l´automne, du tonnerre, 
Une tabagie dans les couloirs
Et les petites infirmières

Et les petits plats, hum, t´y croirais pas
Et dès que je pourrai marcher
J´irai à la fenêtre
Prendre les premiers rayons du printemps

Mon vieux copain, j´ai essayé d´imaginer
A quoi pouvait ressembler cette ville il y a mille ans
Avant les périphériques, les publicités, et tout ça, 
C´était sûrement très bien

J´imagine qu´il y avait des champs et du vent et des étoiles
Je me réjouis de te revoir, de te parler, 
De faire bouger ce vrai pantin de bois
Depuis quelques semaines, les peupliers se répondent dans la cour

Du sommeil il m´en faut pas plus, 
Dès que je pourrai marcher, nous serons loin, 
Le désert sibérien, où tu voudras
Et je laisse la ville et ses rumeurs au milieu du lit défait, 
De tout ce blanc, 
Je t´attends pour de bon mon vieux copain

Je meurs des choses pour lesquelles je n´ai pas su mourir
Je meurs des choses pour lesquelles je n´ai pas su mourir

Il n´y a rien à dire

Du temps qui presse
La maladie de ma jeunesse
Je n´ai jamais aimé d´autre personne que moi
Et pas même toi
Et j´étais si heureux avec toi
Et j´étais aussi heureux sans toi

Je me fous du vent
Qui vient, qui va
Je me fous de la vie
Qui finit ou pas
Je me fous de tes histoires de cinglés
Je me fous qu´il pleuve par le toit
Je me fous du malheur, du bonheur, de la joie
Et de tout ce temps qui s´en va
Je me fous des chansons tristes
Des clés qui ouvrent les serrures
Je me fous de la vie qui glisse
Je me fous de la terre refermée

Je me fous du karma des étoiles
Du soleil déglingué, des jours sans lendemain
Je me fous de tes chagrins
Je me fous du chagrin
Je me fous du chagrin

Le petit train de ma jeunesse
Le petit train s´en va
Se cogne et continue tout droit
Je n´avais besoin de personne
Et personne n´avait besoin de moi
Et j´ai abusé du temps et à présent
Voilà qu´il abuse de moi

Le petit train de ma jeunesse
Et je n´ai rien dit",Le Petit Train,2008
Raphaël,"Je ferme les yeux quand c´est toi qui conduis
J´aime bien fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse
J´aime bien ma vodka du soir et l´odeur du kérosène
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

J´aime bien les taxis de nuit
Quand ils me ramènent à la maison
J´aimais bien notre histoire
Surtout la première année
T´embrasser dans les bars
Et ton pas dans l´escalier
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

J´aime bien les quartiers de lune
Et ta consolation
J´aimais bien me blottir contre toi
Dans le petit avion
Te regarder souffler sur les vitres
Et penser à ceux qui sont tombés
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

Montre-moi, montre-moi le monde du doigt
J´ n´ai pas vraiment souvenir de quand je roulais sous la table
Je baisse la vitre, je laisse la nuit entrer
Laisse-moi fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse
Laisse-moi au moins essayer
Laisse-moi au moins essayer

J´aime bien le cinéma quand c´est toi qui racontes la fin
Quand tu dis du bout des lèvres, quand tu me laves les cheveux
Quand tu crois que tout va bien
Que tu chasses la peur dans mes mains
Est-ce que tu peux me raccompagner?

J´aime bien fermer les yeux et que le monde disparaisse",Quand C'est Toi Qui Conduis,2008
Raphaël,"Tess m'a dit veux tu m'embrasser ?
Tess me dit
Pourquoi me regardes tu ?

Je n'aime pas cette ville
Qui ne comprends rien aux oiseaux

Il est plus tard que tu ne le penses
J'ai grandi tout juste

Je vais regarder la vie me faire vieillir

Si je te tournais le dos

Raphaël,"C´était le temps d´une autre année
Le temps des néons allumés
Le temps des témoins des colombes
Le temps de la vitesse et de l´ombre
Le temps des lettres jetées au feu
Le temps où on était heureux

C´était le temps des bords de mer
Le temps des Gainsbourg des Prévert
Je revois tes cheveux défaits
Dans la chambre d´hôtel tu jouais
Et moi sur la banquette arrière
Je voyais le monde à l´envers

Que vive le vent de l´hiver
Et la chanson de Prévert
Continue sa route à l´envers
Je ne suis pas chrétien
Mais de tout je me souviens


Que vive le vent de l'hiver
et tout retourne à la terre
les loups sont à ma porte
un dernier coup d'oeil en arrière
dans le rétroviseur

C´était le temps de Lili Brik
Le temps du soleil tatoué
C´était le temps des avalanches
Le temps des verres bus et cassés
Ma vie brûlait comme la place rouge
Quand la nuit finissait sa course

C´était le temps des accords majeurs
Où tout était illuminé
Et j´entends battre ton coeur
Doucement doucement
Je ne suis pas soigné
C´était le temps de la Cantate
Le temps où tu la jouais pour moi

Vive le vent de l´hiver
Et la chanson de Prévert
Continue sa route à l´envers
Je ne suis pas chrétien
Mais de tout je me souviens

Vive le vent de l´hiver

Se solo avessi potuto cambiare il mondo all'improvviso
Avrei asciugato le nubi in lacrime per la tua gioia
Avrei sfondato le porte ipocrite di un paradiso
Avrei toccato quell'anima che vive dentro te

Sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno
Sai, oh sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno

E all'improvviso il tutto si delinea proprio come non avrei pensato mai
E nell'immagine, il respiro si distingue ora
Per ogni gioia, lacrima, ogni tuo sorriso sentirai una forza dentro te
Che vince ogni limite

Sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno
Sai, oh sai, per sopravvivere
Ci basta un sogno, sai

Raphael Gualazzi,"Ti guardo e non puoi tentarmi 
Dipinta di un'immagine che non apprezzerò 
Se parli non puoi ascoltarmi 
La magra educazione che diffondi fuggirò 
Le mani non puoi scottarti 
La fiamma si fa labile nell'insensibile 
Mi guardi e non vuoi pensarci 
Ma sei solo un disegno se non puoi 
Decidere 

E vorrei 
E vorrei 
E vorrei 
Vorrei

E vorrei ridere chiedendo delucidazioni 
Ma fuori, a piede libero, ne abbiamo 
Milioni 
Ti sparo nelle gambe e divento cristiano 
Dopotutto non è male se mi sento più 
Umano 

Ricordati le favole che hai già vissuto 
La pace vulnerabile di ogni minuto 
Che vivere e ridere, non è abbastanza 
Mentre imbianco l'uomo nero, tu prendi 
Coscienza

Ed ora 
Ora sai 
Hai visto coi tuoi occhi 
E pianto con i miei 
Non c'è vergogna se non quella di una 
Cieca 
Acquiescenza per viltà, per viltà 
Ma lascia che sia più tardi 
L'inutile lamento che non costruisce 
Mai 
Portami nei miei sbagli 
Che mai ne avrò bisogno 
Come in questo vivere 

Qui non si tratta di una libera denigrazione 
Ma di rendersi partecipi di ogni ragione 
Per vivere, ridere, decidere e sognare 
E mi ricordo quella volta che volevo 
Volare 
E non aspetto le tue regole neanche 
Un 
Minuto 
Propongo i sogni liberi di chi ti ha 
Creduto 
Leggere e scrivere non è abbastanza 
Mentre sbianca l'uomo nero tu prendi 
Coscienza

You have never changed
Things are still the same as they were
And I've never known you

Now
As time goes by
Tears, hate and crying are not for me
They are not for me anymore
But if you have ears to listen and have eyes for crying
If you have somebody and soul, love me, let me die now

Sometimes I worry, oh, that I could be all alone again
Sometimes I worry, oh, that I could be all alone again
Sometimes I worry, oh, that I could be all alone again
All alone again

Now
Tears are all gone

Life welcome home in my heart
Forever and more
But if you have ears to listen
And your heart for crying 
No one loves you more than me in this world

Raphael Rabello,"Silêncio por favor
Enquanto esqueço um pouco
A dor no peito
Não diga nada
Sobre meus defeitos
Eu não me lembro mais
Quem me deixou assim
Hoje eu quero apenas
Uma pausa de mil compassos
Para ver as meninas
E nada mais nos braços
Só este amor
Assim descontraído
Quem sabe de tudo não fale
Quem não sabe nada se cale
Se for preciso eu repito
Porque hoje eu vou fazer
Ao meu jeito eu vou fazer
Um samba sobre o infinito
Porque hoje eu vou fazer
Ao meu jeito eu vou fazer
Um samba sobre o infinito",Para Ver as Meniñas,2003
Raphael Rabello,"Minha vida era um palco iluminado
Eu vivia vestido de doirado
Palhaço das perdidas ilusões
Cheio dos guizos falsos da alegria
Andei cantando a minha fantasia
Entre as palmas febris dos corações

Nosso barracão no morro do Salgueiro
Tinha o cantar alegre de um viveiro
Foste a sonoridade que acabou
E hoje, quando do sol, a claridade
Forra o meu barracão, sinto saudade
Da mulher pomba-rola que voou

Nossas roupas comuns dependuradas
Na corda qual bandeiras agitadas
Pareciam um estranho festival
Festa dos nossos trapos coloridos
A mostrar que nos morros mal vestidos
É sempre feriado nacional

A porta do barraco era sem trinco
Mas a lua furando nosso zinco
Salpicava de estrelas nosso chão
Tu pisavas nos astros distraída
Sem saber que a alegria desta vida
É a cabrocha, o luar e o violão",Chão De Estrelas,2006

When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?) Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend 

Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember
Satan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender

Yo I be on the avenue where they be acting brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo

All of a sudden, I saw these two kids fronting
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nothing
My hand was on my toolie they was acting unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies

Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flaming, steady running off at the Willie

I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo

And I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite

Yo I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealing
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Hey yo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spitting
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash-dancing yo I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's
And all I want, is the world to know my steez
These money hungry niggas is seven thirty
And got me stressed out like these frog MC's

I remember when we was hella broke dude
We just had a dream, right?
We made it happen dude

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

We used to be short on the avenue so broke on the avenue
I couldn't afford to have a brew
How it happened dude, just me and you
I use to drink brew after you

You had your daughter first, my baby son was born right after you
Now we making cash with Dru, oh look what havin' cash would do
Playahatas come after you, if they blast at you
I'd be the first one to prove what the mass would do

One ain't better than havin' two, looney individuals off cash and brew
Lace the avenues boy I ain't mad at you
Hindu drinkin' glass with you, cheers
We lasted through years what we have to do

We finally here, I got 5 showed on the Billboard Live
Doin' songs with Too Short, courtesy of Jive
Front page of the Vibe, live and direct,
Rafael Saadiq freak that beat chorus and drumset
Make your ears wet like sex, who waitin to come next
With Pavey Rolex, just me and you

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

We risked it and killed in Cali before we make bread
Creating our heaven on earth but it's worse we cursed from birth
Now turn money and keepin' moms happy
Got me gladly livin lavelle, I say we blessed to have mail

Big Willie, I'm numb to the world baby
Don't speak among thangs unless it pays me
You never see Yuckmouth weighin circumstances
You never see Numbskull flossin takin chances

Advancement is okay doe and cheatin is alright
And it's best to have some killa's on the payroll, day and night
Stick and move pick and choose licks
Benet wasn't in it that's why Benet didn't benefit

Believe my story the tale of glory didn't make me believe
That in America I never had to worry
Cupid wasn't stupid but never was Numb and Yuck
It was all dreams and wishes, game and luck
Just me and you

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

It was gonna happen man
First we got 5 on it, now we got 5 on big beats
Rafael Saadiq, DJ Quik, G 1, that's how it happened man
Once you get large do your thang, big thangs man

Hey, when you saw my show in '94 you didn't know
We'd blow like Nitroclycerin, Girbaud, Tommy Hill, Timberland
Playboy, I use to rock a pendelton, officer arrests a gentleman
Now I'm spending big deusch marks on German women

In the red light district way out in Amsterdam kickin it
Adam and Eve coffee shop, purchase grams wicked
Disappeared like the grand wizard dig it
Trying to be the richest young black brothas in the business

I heard so many times it was hopeless, bogus
Accordin' to both of us the world was untouched
We had to focus, I had to explain thangs to the fullest
Figured out what we could and couldn't

And made plans to get the puddin'
There's too many rules to made and broke
The mail is to be made so lets fade a toast
Now tell these folks to let me be all I can be
So the L U N I Z will go down is history

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

But i learn 'cause i see, and i earn 'cause i g
But these problems probably havin niggaz prayin to see

Raphael Saadiq,"I been in some hard times, I seen a lot of good times
But everyday I count my blessings this way 'cause I know that everyday's a different day. 
My friends can change but his will never change.
And I knew there would be some time, when I would second guess my mind.

So I kept on walking, kept on striving,
Kept on singing and guess who showed up.

As I walked down the street one day, I thought I heard a brother say
'Living in bad conditions can make you feel like no one, 
As long as I, that's why I always try and do my best to search inside.
But I knew there would be a day, when I had to look the other way.

So I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just kept looking and guess who showed up.

I told myself one day to falll on my knees and pray
And never listen to noone if they can't be true to you
No one should spend precious time living for material love
His money, no money no money, can make me happy.
Now it looks a lot clearer outside, 'cause I'm using my eyes.

I close my eyes and
Kept on pushing,
I just stopped looking and guess who showed up.


My friend won't let you down, He's always been around.
That's one thing I know for sure. Even when I'm wrong, he's right at my door.
He'll never ignore.

Yes, I got a lotta things to say, I can't say them in all one day.
I'll take no credit for the blessings that He's given to me
Without Him I know that Saadiq could never, ever, ever be.
When I thought it couldn't get no better, 
Just when I thought it was almost over.

Oh no
I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just kept looking and guess who showed up.

Oh, oh

I feel responsible when it comes to you
That means I think that I'm addicted to you
I feel like life has just begun for us, yeah
See, there's no one else in this world
That I would'nt wanna trust

When beauty touches the world
I mean each boy and girl
That means our hearts must grow
Girl, let your feelin's show

Our souls will always last

Where I'm supposed to be

We seem to forget to lend a helpin' hand
I knew this task was not gon' be easy, yeah
A lovin' heart like yours
Could bring back all the communities

If you just say the word
I'd spread my wings like a bird
And fly right in your nest
My queen, I'll try my best

To let my spirit flow
Yes, everyone will know
When we're together
Everything we do when the world must grow

Don't look at my smile

What's in you is in me
What's in me is to help them 

I assume the reasons that push us to
Change everything
I would like us to forget about
Their color
So they can be optimistic

Desperate

So they can talk about their pain
And joy
Then we can give them information
That will bring us all together

Be moving

Bad to the bone

Surely you know that I don't want nobody else but you, baby

And I'm still a man, baby
And I'm always gonna be by your side

I know He wrote a new commandment

It's 6:30 live and callin', tellin' Prophet roll up

Take me a second to breathe and let stress go
Walk out, grab my paper and wave next do'
Take me a shower, get dressed and do a quick pass
Say me a prayer 'fore I leave so I can get back

Gotta go share with the world this new movement

Patio in the rain, car hood, the kitchen sink
Layin' in the bed now, pillow talk all night
Gotta hit the studio, I'll be back tomorrow night

How many ladies in the mornin wake up lonely
Love rough sex, baby screamin ""Put it on me""
But when your man ain't around you call his homie
How many times I gotta be him nigga, owe me

She soaks in green tea lotion
Her legs are so outspoken
You'll think this girl is naked

The girl is always sexy
She loves backseats in taxis
And talking good and trashy

I mean the chic like you like just won't stop
Unbutton the top and later hear that k-k-knee drop
I could take you to the Opera and back to the block
Manolos and Gucci Lyn this chic is hot

For real and I mean sizzling hips get the twistness
Switchin' she keep all the playas whistling
She do the foo in bikinis and heels
The way she lick the bits and suck the ice and give a grown man chill

Oh girl when the attendant flip her own whips
Flew a playa the Vegas's for their own chips
Life of the party, the two step queen
She rapped when she seen me with them painted on jeans

You know I don't hit no better than her
Feel like I'm drunk when I see her and I slur my words
She's sexy and classy and she's my type
We can make it last forever just one night what they do, why, why

Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing
Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing

That don't know when to quit
Likes me to jump on it
And I just met her girlfriends

One with an open mind
Lets me eat cherry pie
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Will always keep me guessing
What's under that long jacket
I got this real bad habit

Now if this sounds like you
Girl, let me come inside
'Cause I think that you might be

Raphael Saadiq,"Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

Ever since I was young, it's been my dream
To be successful doin' this music thing
Music is a part of my soul
I'll be sixty years old, still on the road

A grown ass man tryin' to make a livin'
A grown ass man makin' grown man decisions
Relax, I don't want you to work
Let me go out here and put in the dirt

I'll buy you a skirt, brand new Coach purse
Whenever I leave, I know it still hurts
What you want a watch, a bracelet or a chain?
How about my chest? A tattoo of your name

Man, I'm sick of all this luggage that I'm rattlin'
Trust me, I'm sick of flights and all this travelin'
Two weeks in the UK, three days in Hong Kong
It won't be long, I'll be home

Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

Look, your daddy has to hit the road
And I know you're gettin' old enough to notice that I'm gone
And I know I'm your best friend, the one that you look up to
Some people think I'm overprotective but I just love you

And even though I'm gone I'd rather be home with you
And no matter where I'm at your daddy is gon' miss you
You're my little man so be nice to your baby sister
And give mommy a big hug for daddy and kiss her

'Cause I know she gets tired, at times I feel guilty
I wish that I could take y'all with me
But it's crazy out here and I don't wanna expose you
To the frustrations of this rap game that I go through

And honestly I don't even do it for me
I do it so we could live life comfortably
And that's why I wear y'all proudly around my neck
And I don't care who last said it, daddy has your respect
And just know that

Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

Beep, beep, man, here comes the van
I wanna thank Mathew Knowles for giving me a chance
Got the advance, now it's time to hit the streets
And I'll be home in three and a half weeks

What college you goin' to? That's your decision
Just know that I'll be here to pay your tuition
The only daddy you know and that's on the real
And I been takin' care of you since Murray Ill

I moved down south, big old house
Got you two horses and a lake full of trout
And Sundays I put on my new house shoes
Lookin' at TV, watchin' the Lions lose

I miss Papi, Pug, Pepper and Patches
Man, I can't go to sleep on that brand new mattress
Even though I mix music in the band
Big Boi and Dave, see you at Lake Ann

Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

What happened to the soul food?
I’m talkin' good eatin', good seasonin'

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)
But damn I really miss those times (mind oh mind oh mind)
(Mind oh mind) That soul food's on my mind (mind oh mind oh mind)
Mind, mind, mind

Grandma's hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Now before Sunday school, I hustle and I'm on it
I can't slow down, nah, a dollar and a dream
In this life you live, you're either the dealer or the fiend
Leanin' horizontal
The acrobats on the corner, they flip
So when them white vans pull up, Shawty, we dip
Out of view, could've been a track star at the school
But it took the police just to get that .44 out of you
Dash, sprint, hurdle, over those steel gates
They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe
As we used to back when we was in a booster
Watchin' our uncles drink coolers, talkin' pound-for-pound bruisers
Over rib bones
Now I sideways tote
How did Bobby Johnson hold it?
Pull the trigger 'til the clip gone
Potato tip, no potato salad
That American pie ain't even snappin'

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)
But damn I really miss those times (mind oh mind oh mind)
(Mind oh mind) That soul food's on my mind (mind oh mind oh mind)
Mind, mind, mind

Aromas on the corner, these the soul, they say
Some greens just can't be cleaned and you can't wash out the taste
Of rotten roots
Salted looks and herbs if it ain't made with love then it ain't fit to serve, I heard
Some get bruised and battered
Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered
It ain't ripe, it ain't right
That's why most people don't make love no more
They just fuck and they fight
What happened to the stay-togethers?
Die with you, and that means forever
Grandparents had that kind of bond
But now we on some other shit
Nah, we ain't got no rubbers here
I know she creepin' so that ain't my son
Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills
We can't play games no more 'cause we got bills
Back in the day, the yard was oh so filled
Now nobody comes around here

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)
Everything I see (mind oh mind oh mind), sometimes I can't take it (mind oh mind)
But damn I really miss those times (mind oh mind oh mind)
(Mind oh mind) That soul food's on my mind (mind oh mind oh mind)
Mind, mind, mind

(Never thought it'd be, no soul food on my plate
We gather 'round and lie, bow our heads and pray and I)
I still remember, the family parties
The happy faces, no broken hearts
Nobody starvin', but all that there is old news
What happened to the soul food?

Out here in this world, (mind oh mind oh mind) just tryna make it (mind oh mind)

And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fought the love, through the fucked up weather
And she thinkin about her life
With no more work just being a wife
But instead her love, she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work, plus go to school
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, thats her campaign
We fight, we love

It's such a very long day
It started around seven
And I can hear your breath

That's why I love Sunday mornings
Even when it's cold
There was always something burning
That was good for my soul

As I walk through the yard
I can feel you presence
You're giving me the time of my life
And (...) me the life lessons

When they say keep your heads in the sky
And don't be too quick to fit in

The young man I came to be
With life long troubles
You kept a smile on my face

A say how can I ever repay you

And she always tried to tell me

There's been a few days
When people truly let me down
I said (...) things
Just to bring me down

It's just something I gotta go through

Raphael Saadiq,"Summer child,
And Wendy, I ain't seen for a while
Since she's been working,
Trying to catch her old style
With that I got her back, 
My kettle's always boiling,
Snow is falling
And it's truly freezing
Danny ain't been calling,
He's got a family
But outside my door still says
""Welcome on the floor""

Life is just a big ol' game to me
I'd like to be number one on your team,
Call me baby (Baby!)
Pick me up, baby girl (Baby!)
One day someone will snatch me for their lady

The buds in their blooms now
But no letters come from Lucy
She's deep in her book,
Trying to bring down the words
But she's on my mind profusely, my sister Lucy

The birds and the bees
They do their thing in trees
While we're hustling, 
Rosalind's playing the game of life
Looking in the dark light
For the answers to the questions, like

Life is just a big ol' game to me,
I'd like to be number one on your team,
Call me baby (Baby!)
Pick me up baby. (Baby!)
One day someone will snatch me for their lady, (watch me now)
I could never be your number two,
Cause when you're not there,
I'm sure someone is loving you,
And I can't have it,
I won't have it.
One day someone will snatch me for their lady.

You know, sometimes,
See, I find myself confused
It's always ""why this"" and ""why that""
See, have you ever heard the saying ""it's just a game""?
Well, then one more why,
Why can't I start playing?

Life is just a big ol' game to me,
I'd like to be number one on your team,
Call me baby
(Baby!)

I could never be you number two,

I'm sure someone is loving you,

I won't have it.

I'd like to be number one on your team,
Call me baby

I could never be your
Your number two
Cause someone else will come and start loving you.
And I can't have it.
I told I won't have it, now.

See I'm trying to do my best, not to go to hell
I'm counting all my blessing, as I walk the narrow road,
Victory is near, that's what I've been told!

I can feel it getting closer, closer every day
I wanna be a warrior of everything I say
There's trials in the valley, take me upstream
I need to feel this water falling down over me
Falling down over me

I can see my name written across the sky,
Ravens started flying, I saw tears in their eyes
There was fires in the mountains and storms in the sea,
Winds in the valley, rushing into me.

Knock and it will open, seek and you'll be fine,
You're just a flower and the seed is your mind
Clouds will bring us water, and the Sun will bring us heat
But we have the power, moving from sea to sea
Moving from sea to sea

Let love bring us to-gether,
Let love bring us to-gether,
Let it bring us, let it bring us together! 
Let love bring us together!

We need more love
We need more love in the world

I can only wish for more

Chop the block and at quarter to 8

Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
Its my life, no exceptions
Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
You got one life, no exceptions

Now who ran guns with Bounty, did a joint with Rakim
A song with Mariah that had the whole world poppin
Who that be the are-A-Double P-E-are
Niggas fuck with this and they get sent to the E.R.
Now I'm rockin jams with the Screwball fam
They connected so thick, with them men in submission you know who ???
Screwball and the Mobb so sick
We repin' QB son, they wouldn't understand it
We roll so thick that niggas get Noyd
Niggas don't want it 'cause Noyd bring noise
No way, niggas can't stop me, son it shocked me 
They tried, I pulled out and popped three

Chorus

Hey yo
Light the blunts up, cook the coke up
One Times out, so what motherfucker I'm tryin to blow up
And when they show up I put the cracks in the stash
The gats in the grass, when they roll I just blast
With no problem bumpin Primo, to niggas we know
You try, you die like Peschi in Casino
No exceptions to the rule, the Ball to the Screw
Go back like ""check one two""
Street gang to the rap game
Worldwide thang, thugstyle niggas feel the pain
Gotta go hard and sunshine they rain
Blow the block up, fuck niggas, with no exceptions

I'm'a blow my steel, grab the chicken as a human sheild
Break elbows and wheel, no exception is the drill
Is it real, I'm cryin blunt retaliation
Follow ?wallet? for your information
4-1-1, scoop all we want dun-dun
Cash is the issue, while you blab about ya pistol
But you never blast a missile, ship your bagette pistol
Gettin scissors on they gun shot wound, you doomed
With no exception

Chorus

Yo, the streets baptised me to money and war
Gettin yours is a law that we never ignore
We score twice or more, keep it moving twenty-four
We seven days with no rest, still fresh looking
Our names inflamed with the smell of tongue cooking
The hoods rotten, we see the ??? from the crabs plottin
The sneak kill, sabatoge our deal
But we overlook it, 'cause our environment is crooked
And hard to finger who the D's got as a singer
Spillin the beans on the dealers and the fiends
So I move separate and conversate with the connections
On the low key, gettin this money with no exceptions

Chorus

Yeah that's right
We all Screwball up in here
No exceptions baby

Getting down, wasting money, just fooling around, we felt free,
Like birds in the sky, I want you all to get everything,

Been played like a game on the wheel
Stealing my heart, I see a man by your side, giving you the love I tried,
But I couldn't provide
Please, dreams we shared are just souvenirs,
Yours, for glad laugh, said tears,
Last night we talked,
And you didn't say much, I told you that I love you,
You said ""We'll keep in touch""
I sit back and remember how it used to be back than,
You and me together again those dreams and wishes are where they belong, son,

Se entregar por inteiro, viver uma louca paixão
E se deixar levar, seguindo o coração
Deixando dores pra trás
Eu quero, me entrego, com a fé que eu te espero
Sei que vou te encontrar e amar cada vez mais
Esquecer o tempo vendo o pôr do sol na beira do cais
E assim como um par de pássaros voar pra um lugar
Só nós, a sós, com nossa voz iremos cantar
Essa hora chegará a mim virá, pode apostar, pode apostar

Só o amor constrói, sentimentos de paz
Só o amor constrói, o destino é quem faz
Só o amor constrói, constrói, de fato 
A maior felicidade é te ter ao meu lado

O destino me fez ir embora
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem
Pode não ser o fim da nossa história
O destino me trouxe até aqui
Minha intuição me diz pra continuar
Seguir meu coração

O destino nos uniu, você já sabe
Tudo começou como se fosse amizade
Naturalmente a gente foi se envolvendo
Foi se gostando, se conhecendo
Aquela noite eu me lembro, foi fatal
Não esperava o seu beijo num luau
Uma viagem se tornou inesquecível
Eu percebi que era mais que um amigo
Todo dia eu corria pra te ver
Eu admito, apaixonado por você
Mas de repente um casal as vezes briga
Eu fico triste, pois você é minha vida
Eu quero mais te amar todo o tempo
Convivência assim, sem sofrimento
Tô cansado de ficar aqui sozinho
Amor eu tô voltando, aí é o destino

O destino me fez ir embora (seu bye bye, assim, não foi legal)
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem (cê foi embora, amor, nem me deu tchau)
Pode não ser o fim da nossa história
O destino me trouxe até aqui (uma paixão não termina assim)
Minha intuição me diz pra continuar (tenho certeza, não é o fim)
E seguir meu coração

Quando eu acordo você vai dormir
Você me achou e eu te perdi
Entre encontros e desencontros
Será que é isso que a vida preparou
Para nós, saiba que não vou desistir
De estar com você

O destino me fez ir embora (seu bye bye, assim, não foi legal)
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem (cê foi embora, amor, nem me deu tchau)

Somebody hold me hold me, I'm getting hyper
A secretary couldn't fade me on a typewriter
All these concepts and new arrivals
For ninety-foe I'm dropping fourteen titles
Walk with this, ride with this, slide with this
Still guaranteed to move yo hips
So do what cha want to girls get sassy
Oh get to talkin bout oooooh that's nasty
What's nasty the way you dancin
Shakein you pants and
Niggas be glancin
Don't blame it on the Rag Top mob
Your just doin your thing I'm doin my job
To a faster pace I lace the beat nicely
Once again friends it's so spicy
Finger lickin, never getting caught up no mo
Suckas want to see me stretched out on death row
Instead of rockin every crowd that I run into
But they can't fade me and sure can't fade you
From Frisco to Oaktown dank is smokin
Vallejo to San Jo niggas choking
I'm a do my part don't fight the feelin
Oh shit 4-Tay is back again

Rappin' 4-Tay,"It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

For 1994, Tay is in this muthafucka
An' I could never be a silly stupid ass sucka
Busta, it runs in the family
Shakin' 'em, breakin' em, takin' em like a vet from the bay, G

Seff the Gaffla that's my nigga were persuin' this
Giggalo, giggalo G, boy you're doin' this, beat
So let me kick a verse about that shit called chronic
Don't try to play it stupid 'cause I know you up on it

You probably just rolled you one, probably just smoked you one
Callin' up the hooker play the ho for another one
Late night hustlin' in the projects, O.C.
My brothers in the dark an' were way past OD
Just flipped my money, feelin' good and I'm cheesin'
Seff'll hook you up or put you up on the season

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

Rappin' 4-Tay, what's up with these foo's
Actin' like ho's when these niggas know the rules
So I'm about to flow, an' let these niggas know
About the why, the be, the G, it ain't easy being me, so

Break down the dank, roll it up with the quickness
Pass me a lighter so I can cure my sickness
How many hits does it take to make you stop?
How many tapes does it take to make you pop?

Go ahead an' tell me 'cause I really wanna know
Smokin' ind-e-o with my nigga Rappin' 4
Never beat around the bush I'm gettin' straight to the point
After every meal I fire up a dank joint

Gettin' high as a bird, a bald head eagle
Man I can't wait until they make dank legal
That'll be the day that'll probably be the end
Loungin' in the Mo smokin' dank drinkin' gin

Kinda like a rocker but I live in the ghetto
I got you hangin' on so you better not let go
Have a seat, what cha see, dank in your cup
Gain your composure while a nigga fire up

I smoke dank daily to the point that I'm lazy
Every day I smoke a half a quarter, can't faze me
You know who I am, so go ahead and jam
Fire up the dank while you let the tape slam, damn

I feel hella good for some reason
Got a nigga cheesin'
Indo's in season
Humboldt-Kelly all the way to the bay
Ragtop Productions with my homie Frankie J

Hooked a nigga up when he heard a nigga flow
Anotha platinum hit with the nigga Rappin' 4
And oh, you didn't know, I coulda told ya
You ain't got five on the dank that I hold ya
Ran out of Zags, get some more from the corner store
Seff the Gaffla, nineteen ninety Rappin' 4

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

Break a, break a twenty sack down to two joints
And fuck all that other shit niggas gettin' to the point
Pass me a baggie so I can empty the sack
I feel the bass in the back, if you can hang get the contact

'Cause niggas twistin' more than just your average dank smoker
Me an' my homies we blaze this shit we gets ova
An everyday routine if you fakin' with your paper
Call up my nigga 'cause he clockin' on this pager

Sticky, sticky green, oh no, I can't fade the brown leaf
Nothin' does it better than that potent ass indo weed
Keepin' my composure plus this douja's got me coughin'

And if one of these niggas don't pass the blunt I might go off
An' snatch it up an' smash it up an' puff it till it's outta there
You say you spent twenty dollars but ask me if I care
Now I got the munchies, need some cookin' from my boo
But she's out with her potters they in the cut smokin' dank too

Seems that everybody's smokin' plenty marijuana
But don't let that be the reason you're caught up in some drama
From slippin' and trippin' this lip until you're stuck
Sucka Free City niggas know what's up, what's up

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

It's the dank season for nineteen ninety four
Seff the Gaffla and Rappin' 4, yo
Everybody's smokin' chronic fuck the reason
It must be pleasin' man it's dank season

Now pass that muthafucka up on the left hand side, man
Giggalo what's up G?
What's up boy?
You know I'm still just chokin' smokin' same old thing
Ain't nothing changed

Yeah, I'ma send this one out to all the dank smokers out there
It's all good baby boy
It's the dank season
And let the chronic be the muthafuckin' reason
We up out this muthafucka for 1994
Me and Seff the Gaffla, it's like that G
Here we are

Rappin' 4-Tay,"Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP 12, now, you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight

Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo

A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till when these women get the notion that they runnin' the game, huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then

Fillmoe, H.P. and Sunnydale, there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H. and Army Street, a different part of town
A different kind of freak, I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

More champagne, Mr. 4-Tay?

From day one, I had to get my money right
Me, Fly and Franky J we took a airplane flight, huh
They wanted to hear a rap, I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check

A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable

Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin' my paper chase
'cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop

So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin' 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas poppin' off at the lip

I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some Dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now, homie what you all about?

I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five, some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer

A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin' in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two Shoes, see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin' but a playa hater

I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts

So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club out there in Chicago
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?

You know they got one out there in Atlanta, the way they by choppin'
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these
Playaz Clubs close to home like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego

P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shot goes out to the
Playaz Club right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least yeah, them

And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time

And find my folks, relatives, real playaz, I know they turnin' it out

A victim of circumstances, plus my blade was much thicker
You want to be gangsters behind these walls it's so much drama
I done seen the hardest nigga switch up and call home to momma

Stepped up and swept up every turf wit disagreements
And every bitch that havin' a bowl of some of that ...
But ain't it a shame you can only travel across the streets to the store
They don't even trust you and that mother cause you robbed it before
Got you a sack of that yack and snored it, and snored it up
Than robbed another nigga the cut cause you didn't give a fuck
Everybody is blessed wit tha devil, he be a motherfucker
Get him off your back, get 'em off yo back before you kill your brother
On some of that kokane shit gets crazy I done seen it

Up the stairs to the vacabt house, that's we're we prctice at
We didn't have a studio so man we had to work with that
No reel to reels, no mic, just the radio
Paper and oen and I was in, the heart of the ghetto
Trying to pursue my dream, trying to make things right
I posted up at other people's shows begging to get the mic
I was kicking down doors, posted up, like the 49ers 
All I wanted to do was bust a rap before the headliners
They pushed me to the left, I said alright, that's cool
Now you call my booking agent, everyday, I paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what! 

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
The difference is you're talking about the game you see I'm living in
And all my folks R.I.P, I'LL see you in a minute
Before I cut I gots to shock it cause I'm still pissed
For my mistakes, court dates and the time I missed
A lot of deputies in correctional facilities
I kept they ass up all night, but now they feelin me
From bangin on the walls and bustin raps off the top ten
Bet you never though I be the entertainer of the year
But why not, cause I've got, what it takes to represent
Crowd could be a hundred thousand, I'm never hesitant
Just ask Franky J. to drop me an old school beat
Them funky instrumentals kept me of the streets
They kept me motivated, I was always underrated
I bet my real folks wasn't surprised when I made it
Plus I gave them digits back to the parole board
So now I'm cool, I'd been paid my dues

Chorus:

I talked the talk, but now I'm walking the walk
What up, fool! Huh yeah! Yeah! What,what!",I Paid My Dues,1996

Rappin' 4-Tay,"I wonder why there's so much hatred in this world today
You know a lotta of us brothers and sisters 
Ain't gone make it to see another day
At the age of 12 I was on another page
I wanted to jug upon tha other people were gettin' their pay
My momma would always tell me about the direction that I was heading
Like the majority of these kids today, man I was hard headed
I wanted to know to much a little man is shookin' police
Imagine a juvenile delinquent waitin' for a release date
Wait, it's easy for me to blame it on my surroundings
My folks raised me right, I just wanted to be the first fool pounding
Up and down tha block, Fleetwood Caddilac
But take it from me, young G, because that lifestyle ain't all that
Unless you ready to strap ya gat and serve tha yak and jug the sack
To get ya bread back, playa, I'm up on all that
Cause being broke ain't no joke, boost up ya confidence
There's two options:legal or illegal, you know the consequenses

Chorus:
Stay strong through all this drama, cause there's a remedy
This world is so corrupt, jealousy and envy
To all my folks in tha pen I'm sending this to you, ya know
Hope you get to hear my rap, try to make it off parole

The streets are full of sadness, dope and geto madness
Besides your brain and slangin' them thangs the only apparatus
Be that hot lead, I seen him yesterday but now my homie's dead
I hope I ain't going crazy, I know I ain't losing my head
No more obituaries, no more hearse, that shit hurt
You damn right, but see there's game plus a part of life
Got so much game to give they label my rap positive
Why not take advantage of that and give it back to my neighbourhood
Because them people wit them badges callin' themselves police
Be them same suckers going home selling hella weed
Everybody's human we need to live by the constitution
I ain't no dummy, behind them walls of congress someone's juicin'
How you think the streets get flooded wit guns and knives and crack
Us blacks ain't got the type of machinery to deliver that
And the people that do kick back in mansions, pushing remotes
I ain't no hater, but man the law can't stand them folks

Chorus

Once that crack hit this world a lot of us lost our minds
Foolz was selling everything in tha house down to the iron
After Scarface I wanted to be like Tony Montana
Until the narcs caught me slippin' on tha ...
They followed me and sweated me as if I was a rich man
I'm just a playa up out of Frisco tryin' to put my mack hand down
I be around just like tha single
Twinkle twinkle who's tha star, how I wonder where you are
Stepped in tha back then test tha mic and break 'em off a proper ...
That's what I did for representing Cali, you know
I used to be local but now I'm a nation wide professional
Once I get home to tha Bay, six days are so boring
Down to call for my P.O. she wants to test my urine
Now I'm tryin' to think did I drink or did I smoke too much
Here I am in her office, I forgot to hide these bucks
Livin' beyond your means you know that's a violation, bro
Peace to all my homies across the world, stay off parole

Yeah, Pac, you know Ragtop we got love, man

Holler at a player though
4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
I keeps my distance from haters cause I'm quick to flash
Area takes me with a passion, I tap that ass
Be quick to blast, the game just ain't the same no more
You doing too much, pump your brakes, slow your roll
Fucking up the hustle with the streets and shit
It's too much legal tender on my agenda to bite our fame
But if you play me, I gots no choice to reach you in check
They playing with a full deck, you can get the breakfast, say thanks

[Verse 2: E-40]
See I'm a business man with a set of big balls
Marketing meetings and, uh, got Frisco
Just ain't your work for a living (uh huh)
They got hit, what the fuck?, you think I been got shit?, it ain't easy
Everyday now walk through the streets
A nigga can't even sit down with his family
And be straight and have a decent dinner
Without a motherfucker yelling, ""Refalations""
""What I got to do to get you in my compilations?"" (compilations)
So I study what I do, the shit for you for free (for free)
I used to do that to a nigga when I was seventeen (uh, uh)

[Chorus: Rappin' 4-Tay, E-40]
[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
What's the world coming to when niggaz talk down for fun
Some Rappin' 4-Tay you don't make me dumb
Pop a cherry, we don't mean that much
Cause if it don't make dollars I don't really give a fuck
Jocking all up under my name but you don't even know me
Got me fucked up and one of them suckers when they so called homies
If that's the shit, better pause and magnum or Crip, they ready to paint us
When niggaz go against the great 40 Water, what's wrong with the game?

[Verse 4: E-40]
I'm ten years hung in this shit, if I was up to heart
My nigga got dick, her is his, by selling chicks in front of his car
Got a crib with 9,000 square, Christine and Marsha, will you just imagine?
Big ass improving for Maximus, big ass, let's fetch it
I seen it in my dream when I was nine years old
My Momma always told me to achieve my goal
Keep a cool bid and, uh, respect a dollar
Never get too greedy for the money and power

[Chorus: E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay]
[Verse 5: E-40]
The reason I carry glocks, 26 on my side of my hip
Cause I ain't dumping now (dumping now), thinking of now a days
They act like you owe something (something)
Talking about, ""40, show me some love!, (show me some love!)""
Because I got a, a despot I'm my blood
Niggaz want to knock ME
Cause I don't blossom like a sunflower SEED
Surrounded by promises, you said that you keeps me smoking big WEED
Drinking while sipping Ale (sipping Ale) yes INDEED
Born and raised in Vallejo (eeehhhh!)

[Verse 6: Rappin' 4-Tay]
They claim they got solid rockets
So all my true player partners, why'all just stay focused
And watch them haters cause they plots on a daily basis
Hustlers, servants, traders that caught so many dope cases
And but I want the quickness if the G's is right
If that game was tight, ballers had pimped at it, ain't no such thing as
three strikes
No sense, our fucking minds aren't, but I'm on parole and shit
Niggaz get to running off at the mouth just like a snitch, some like a bitch
Ehhh!, Ehhh!

Strikeless hitch-hikin' while these ballers out and crusin'
He rose a bucket, he rose a Beamer acrunk, shoo! (shoo)
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose
Somebody's gotta win, but now, somebody's losin

Everybody claimed they got it locked like prison bars
From the North, to the South, to the East, to the West,
all us playas livin large
Workin' on your opponent, workin' on it too much, you dreamin'
This shit you see on these videos ain't always what it seems
Life is based on game, and game is based on witch dot
Trippin' off what the next man got
And get your grip
Remember, love don't love nobody but we love the way it feels
And let it be a good damn thing, if love can pay the bills
Got you in my zone now, shoot them crooks now
Now I'm booked out on my own now, it's goin' down, platinum bound
Here we go again two nappy heads in they plot (plot)
Dog, you be surpised with all these capers I be spottin'
that's why murder rates increase, it should be peace
But now, who am I to speak when all I did my youth was creep? (creep)
Duckin' it dodge to my so-called homeys, they phoney
Tryna get me, tryna hit me
I'm takin' that sucka with me before he split me 
 
[Chorus]
[Verse III]
If you came where I come from, YOU KNOW WHERE I'M COMIN' FROM
Takin' so many chances, livin' life on the run
No fun, espcially for a playa situation, get critical
murder one and that's pitiful but yet it's soblentioul
Way beyond your knocks fool, peep fool, check the ????????
Death ain't got no date and no time, don't never go away
But playa-haters gon' hate on how much money you make
Because, money makes the world go round
Livin' life like ?????, this is cabbage
With hundred stick situation, so savage
So tragic, need a hot meal in my baby's belly
Remenise no hard times in my pen in my selly
I ain't tryna go back, 'cause backwards ain't part of my PJ
I need that might dollar to survive in these ghetto streets
Them devils want me isolated, like chicken drawers
I'm tryna get mine (mine)
I hope you get yours (yours)
I hope you get yours, get it, get it

Now it's on nigga (cause you a gone nigga)

Leave you hollow or with flash or die from the gun blast
They can't see me in the beany or black ski mask
Body bags dumped in trash I'm like sideways
Yellow tape on the scene to the slaughter on the highway
My way or no way at all, it's like a pimp's ball
Thought I want it all, got a problem we can brawl
Cops bigger, did he figure he ready to war
Buck! one, two, three niggas on the (floor)

Gang draw, echo three blocks and four
Heard the motherfuckin' blast like it was right next door
Boom! fall out nigga you though you was hit
Take a puff of the blunt say mobb life's the shit
You see a nigga smash off in are-grey and a black six
It's the infamous fetty chico from the bay bitch

Rappin' 4-Tay,"Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP 12, now, you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight

Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo

A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till when these women get the notion that they runnin' the game, huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then

Fillmoe, H.P. and Sunnydale, there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H. and Army Street, a different part of town
A different kind of freak, I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

More champagne, Mr. 4-Tay?

From day one, I had to get my money right
Me, Fly and Franky J we took a airplane flight, huh
They wanted to hear a rap, I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check

A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable

Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin' my paper chase
'cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop

So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin' 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas poppin' off at the lip

I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some Dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now, homie what you all about?

I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five, some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer

A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin' in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two Shoes, see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin' but a playa hater

I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts

So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club out there in Chicago
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?

You know they got one out there in Atlanta, the way they by choppin'
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these
Playaz Clubs close to home like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego

P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shot goes out to the
Playaz Club right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least yeah, them

The sneak kill, sabatoge our deal
But we overlook it, 'cause our environment is crooked
And hard to finger who the D's got as a singer
Spillin the beans on the dealers and the fiends
So I move separate and conversate with the connections
On the low key, gettin this money with no exceptions

Chorus

Yeah that's right
We all Screwball up in here
No exceptions baby
My team go to any extreme to get the weight up
Streets don't stop, streets don't stop
No exceptions
Gotta get it, gotta get it
All in it to win it

[Mr. Ill]
I was missing from my christening
Chewing on my writing pen pursuing the enlightenment
To tighten nitwit game and lighten dim lit brains
The Rebirth, shit, I'm off the hook now
You see dirt through these terse, you will get shook pal
But look how children, be on some other shit
When the brother split, he coming back double grip
Bubble fit (Now) Bola (How?) Up off that cola
(Wow) Yo I done told ya (Blow) His life is over
Treachery is out to get with me, mental telepathy is saving me
I wear it like a badge of bravery, for safe haven see
Cause the grave in me calling me, but I ain't falling, G
They come in walls of three, I let 'em all have heat
I'm a let you know, check your testicles
Bet you're skeptical, with the letting go and wet you slow
And your ho, she gets some too, see your crew get run through
For you to undo, is like a llama learning kung fu
Drama's what I run you, mama's what you'll run to
I'm a go on and dump you and make you something to slum to
Chump you forgot to ask him, I got that platinum
Jump you, I bag and burn him, and bad ones learn from
Desert tongues get stripped out, if you gonna jump ship shout
You flipped out, then get clout, but that's not what this shit's bout
You salting my name, halting my fame, faulting my game
Niggas know I bring assault like the same

Fuck you bitch, I fish to fuck you quick
And what you get, is no props, I'm blowing up your whole block
It don't stop, I'm on top of this going down
Nigga peep Ron flow, the lawn mower's mowing now
And nigga I'm about to cut your grass
Smash the gas, hit the block, adjust the mask and bust your ass
Fuck the past, focus on the present tense
With president and no paraphernalia or evidence
I'm heaven-sent but never repent so I won't make it back
But if I go tell, fuck it, I might as well take a strap
As I bail through hell's deepest dungeon
I plunge in the fire pit, to see if I die quick
Or if I get ressurrected and reincarnated
And when motherfuckers look to check, double are made it
Rappin' Ron, sending busters to trapping john
Blowing up so much shit niggas swore that I just got back from Nam
Bombs drop when Ron cocks nine glocks
And when the time's hot my nine pops non-stop
So nigga why not bust a shot and leave fools dead
Cause fool I got chops and glocks in my toolshed
Who said that you fled and Ron never stomped ya?
Nigga, I'm a monster, you know Ron can conquer
I'm the rawest flawless, Diddley Dog is the tallest
And I'm the shortest, but notice that I flow this
You're bogus, you can't get me, hit me or fuck with me
The shit be bumping, it's just me and Ant Diddley
Dumping, pumping, swelling fools' heads like a pumpkin
And my assumption is that you'll be shorter than a munchkin

Triple-6 thoughts got me caught up like Anita in the rapture

Bow down to the devil taker, bodybag zipper creep

But different, cause what the nigga meant was insignificant
A ligament is what I'm finna breaking then I wake is what I hit em with
I make the nigga shake then penetrate
And yeah I did the shit, for all you suckers and cluckers
And motherfuckers causing ruckus, and bustas who think they hustlers
What's this world coming to? Crews is what I'm running through
You're tumbling, wondering, what the fuck I done to you
Cause one or two, I'm coming through, three or four, we can throw
But five six seven and eight, you gonna go to hell and wait
Until I get there, shit yeah, then it's gonna be on

Big fat dick out to you side busting, ho trusting ass

Us East Bay niggas ain't trusting no hoes
Before we trust a bitch we suck 1000 clapping dicks

A bitch ain't nothing but a sympathetic wreck
All she fall to the toilet and break her motherfucking neck
Bitch, back on up and recognize young Jock for the 95 or 96

Rapsody,"Ayo, hoes holler hallelujah, how I maneuver
Passenger's side with Ruger, kinda sewer
My mind is a sewer, infested with garbage
Crime, rhyming and music, disrespecting the market
Like a Mexican martyr, boy, I do it to death
Nothing left with the carcass, squeeze a Tec on the target
Aim the wreck at your artist, flames, a mess on the carpet
Then hit everything except for the daughter
Cat burglar to a merciful murderer
Certainly not with the circus, they trying serve
I'm either too hood for my own good
Or I'm too good for my own hood
Cold is the climate in the hearse
Where they found me in the dirt, too demonic for the church
I body any and everybody until the day they put my body in the earth
This is ghetto gossip while I work

Live from Venice, the something menace
Put me in the Guinness for raising hell up for all the sinners
High as tinters, violinists, I string them all along
Tied to the flow like water skis in the red ocean
Hang like an apostrophe, any MC no Qu'ran
I prayed to the God, then prayed on their bodies all at once
Sun setting, never regretting the day's events are gone
Forgive me for my sins, with everything that I ?
Sweaty, sick as spaghetti, my noodle machete sharp
To niggas that wanna spark, I pray for you, hallelujah
Quick as a cougar when I maneuver
You spit maneuver, eating Peruvian in my rishwa pen
Pretty Julia Robinson, I'm a woman robbing you
Of your coolness, part of the reach like the stewardess
Underground like the sewage is, who fucking with the kid?
Did this show evidence?
International, such an animal, yeah I really been
Killing on the daily, you niggas crazy and asterisk
Star, follow me you could probably find the main jar
I been major, it's Rapsody, boy

I don't trust the score, I've been baffled by judges' cards before
Never leave it in their hands, that's the art of war
I learned the proper punching power started from the floor
Ground up, renovate, a wall is just another door
Resurrected like the phoenix, blazing every stage
Spread my wings and fly, but gravity's a heavy cage
Hellfire and heaven's rage on every page
Revelation propaganda, maybe it's the seven plagues
Aiming at the tower, same commercial, different station
They stuck on training wheels and tracing paper, vapor chasing
I'm half amazing, a quarter sinner, a quarter savior
Fascinated, Rakaa seen the wretched paint the righteous painting
My travel agent's favorite, preacher's son, no sign of fading
The lights weaponized, fireworks at night displaying
The blazing arrows fly, a thousand points of light just raining
Careful when you're in the quarters, chariots are hydroplaning

Fucker, we from the hundreds now
Kill a fuck assumption, we bucking off or we ducking down
Couple blocks away from the form, check how we run this town
You fuckers get this work in this bun, check my circumference now
Circle wasn't set stretching, yoga flame
Hottest rapper in the streets and they don't even know his name
Kept the dope, boy, and I ain't even need a golden chain
I'm focused, man, you shooting like a rookie that don't know his range
Smoking, watch me go insane, opus and the Novocaine
Shit was once an open game, we got it by a rope and chain
Losing all control of wild paintings in my broken brain
I don't think you get it, scrap me down for anything you niggas sending at me
Young niggas flexing, mean mugs but trigger happy
I'm getting high, I don't ever let a minute pass me
I'm feeling famished, bitch, I'm sick of fasting
About that action, we can get it cracking
Never find shit to match

I caught a body, they called it a verse
Called the cops, I caught the life, they calling a hearse
Pain is easy in reverse, I think pleasure hurts
The first rule is win, the second's don't forget the first
I think the worst now behind us
Hello first-timers, it's welcome to one-liners
Question anything against the center of alignment
This rock ain't a diamond until it's polished up and shining
Decide to ride the retro minutes to the summit's peak

They throwing shade against the team when the others meet

After this drops, nothing’s best kept but nothing’s secret
If nothing’s nothing, then what the fuck is getting even?

I keep the simpleton spit in all the sympathy lines
I mean it’s Craig G rap came on symphony shines

You ain’t built to shoot the fire with me, that’s the thing
I’m only after one thing, money, that’s the rings
I’m only after one head, money, that’s the king’s
A rack on a bigger rack and so he have to sing

And that’s a beautiful love there, it has a gleam
You wasn’t in a platoon, cousin, cause that was Shane
Old school, still loaded the guns with Vaseline

Selling the J dirty boogie, gray hoodie, hit the dougie
Pinky rings on racks of chicken nuggets
Shit’s like shooting fish in a bucket, damn the hummus
I’m in Japan for the summer, land the plane
Or Jamaica, black rain in the forecast
Four-four class, open a stolen Accord door and haul ass
Body disposed by Albanian doorman for four grand, aw man
I throw the lamb in the ground and leave it overnight
You ain’t ever seen this in your life
You ain’t used to being where I been to, Curly and my men do
You ain’t been through shit I been through

I can’t protect you from it like I used to do past years
So, I leave it all in God’s hands and pray like the pastors
I know the world tough, wish I could hide it like cashmere
Wool over your eyes, though we hunger like fast here
For truth, in your youth your only problem was mad beer
Now the glass empty and you fill it mad tears
Cause peace don't come cheap when you paying like cab fare
Yea, and, war is a beast right?
Looking at the stars like we used to do all night
And, I'm praying on 'em all hoping that you are alright
Thinking of the days we used to chill and drink tall sprites
Life was simple, just work and pay bills off
Now you far away fighting, feeling like Bill Maher
These real times, tryna understand what you kill for
How it feel heavy like the weight of steel door
And, still I open up and share with you heavy hearts
Praying for my brother in Afghanistan fighting war
Against brothers that you’d probably mistake him for

Cause hate ain't born in you, it's just something they raised on”
Shoot 'til the fade gone and practice decease
We gotta fight cause we can overcome and we don't compete
I got the gift of gab like Gab Douglas, just gotta reach out
The bars are in my hand, they can't stand like the beach house
The flow, I finally see now
The ones that hate the most just want to be where we be now
Another day running to makeup like the sad clown
Reverse roles they use to hold all of us all down
Yo, it came to me like Dan Brown
Da Vinci code, we all seeking truth they don't want us to know
Yo, like what we really all fighting fo’?
It you ask me yall we all need to just pray mo’

Rapsody,"Look don't worry 'bout anything they told you
Remember what she SAID about winter and what the cold do
Everything's a season and some things you gotta go through
Believe me I don' seen it all, you're young talking to the old you
When haters come around look 'em down tell 'em “we don't owe you”
You gon' lose some friends but those circles are better than the ovals
A black man left the Oval
Keep that style you got soulful
The best of the best gon' fear you
Sky's the limit see, I told you
You gon' be the difference between McDonald's, Burger King and Whole Foods
Do your thang and slip thru on 'em they ain't gon' have no clue
You won’t need no toll booths, they'll pay attention, Hov do
They'll ask you for advice tell 'em the same thing I told you
Should be a crime to be this fly and awesome
And to think love is all it cost 'em
Feel like Jordan this the ball that Pippen tossed 'em
I'm the underdog and gold is what flossin’
When they told me my chances of losing was higher than divorces
You gotta know your worth and work ‘cause I can't force ya
Growing up I shopped at KMart and Ross’, celebrated every win
And learned to learn from all my loses
I never signed paperwork without reading the clauses
My parents worked way too hard to not get no credit for it
I'm a trip like Grayson Allen
Y'all never made me VALID
I learn that from Phylicia and Debbie Allen
I'm the other one them another ones screaming like Khaled
We don't match up, ask my stylist
I rock Nike and New Balance
I drink water by gallons, y'all should call me captain
I was told to be the flow and not follow it while y’all actin’
I'm the better version of what you used to think and call talent

Kujo still the scariest of all the dogs
After that come all my dawgs
Talent level’s thru the walls
I'm the Juggernaut, riding wit my car doh’ locked
Coppers known to hang out on these kinda blocks
Don’t get shot
They say we 3/5ths human, well the rest of me’s an Autobot
I’m really hot
You should ask my team and dem
Jamla’s still the squad and my confidence is thru the roof

I was just making it clap to Wacka Flacka last Christmas
Clap for a nigga wit her rappin’ ass

Off love, feel like half a month
Too weak to lie about how I feel about you (feel about you)
Too go on to lie about how I feel about you (feel about you)
Two lies I tell if, well, I lied than try to say how I ain't wanna lie around you
That's the truth
It's in her spirit, I had to let this loose
Go!

Once I start sippin' I need more (more)
And it feels so good, I might just let it go, go
Let it go, go
Might let it go, go
And it feels so good I might just let it go

I think I said enough all my liquor’s gone
I must’ve drank enough now I’m feeling numb
Afraid of what I might’ve said in my defense
I was a bit over the edge
I know I owe it to you
Just be the same without drinking but
It all pours out and I’m on my own
Dangerous alone, could you just take me home?

Oh, (ooh)

I'm wilin' out for the dough, though make sure that you never let me out

They say love is a funny thing
But what's funny is the company that money brings
Every year my circle's getting smaller
Not Ben Baller but never had a thin wallet
I got dollars in different forms of currency
I got problems, but ain't nothing that worry me
And I ain't saying that I'm worry-free
I'm just saying nothing's fucking with me currently
Shit, I'm my own worst enemy
I make bread just to spend it like it's ten of me
It's Evidence and people call me by my government
Call me for weed, but don't call me for that other shit
Absorb the game that was meant to be sold
Not told, I heard good fortune favors the bold
So I'm standing in the rain, gambling the game
In the circle rolling dice with a hand full of gold and we go

Told my nigga Evidence, I don't leave no evidence
Not a trace, but they gon' know the Wraith was in their residence
The revenant, comes for the settlement, niggas is so irrelevant
They gon' try to use you, they gon' want your watch
And your chain and your shoes too, niggas will straight abuse you
They gon' stand there and act like they paid dues too
If you're right, then stay right
If you're wrong, then get gone, my nigga, then so long
Do you really want the best for me?
Are you happy when niggas' testing me?
You just trying to figure out my recipe
You will never get it, just bounce, nigga, you're stressing me

If I wasn't on this wave, if I didn't have this come up
Would you love me if I didn't have 9th or Alicia's number?
If I wasn't with the Roc, would you run and tell your friends
That you know me and I'm hot? Would I be in your Top 5?
Would you hit me back or see me later and tell me you forgot?
If I wasn't in that flick standing in front of the ride
Would you wanna make up if we had failed like you had thought?
Would you by my single on iTunes and pay $1.20-something?
Are you like the rest, sheep, blind leading the blind?
Would you praise me even if I didn't have a Dre co-sign?
Tell me what you want: new shoes or free tickets?
Don't ask me again, hit Dave if you want Kendrick
I know real love, I listen to Mary J
I can't carry you too, baby, ain't none of you marry Jay
Every breakup don't make up—the rest of you, Mary Kay
Screaming ""Westside!"", niggas gon' drive me crazy

Gib ihr die Kraft, die sie braucht (die Kraft, die sie braucht) 

Schwarzes langes Haar, hohe Stiefel, sexy Outfit
Geschminkt und gut duftend, wenn sie aus'm Haus geht
Ihrem Kind noch 'nen Kuss gibt, damit es weiterschläft 
Mit Tränen auf den Wangen macht sie sich auf den Weg 
Vor der Tür steht der Wagen von 'nem Typen mit der Lederjacke 
Er ist ihr Aufpasser, Zuhälter, so 'n Ledernacken
Goldkette tragender Glatzkopf, so 'n richtiges Arschloch 
Begrüßt sie mit Küsschen und hebt sie am Arsch hoch 
Sie gibt ihm 'ne Schelle und steigt ins Auto ein 
Er ihr hinterher und man hört nur noch Geschrei 
Der Wagen fährt los, direkt ins Hauptbahnhofsviertel 
Bevor sie arbeiten geht, drückt sie sich das Zaubermittel 
Das ihren Kopf freimacht und ihren Körper schmerzfrei 
Es klopft an der Tür und der erste kommt rein
So 'n alter dicker Knacker und winkt mit zwei Scheinen 
Er kauft ihren Körper, doch ihre Seele bleibt frei

Sie ist jung, geht noch zur Schule
Und jeder mag sie, weil sie gerne für einen da ist 
Doch jeder Tag für sie eigentlich 'ne Qual ist 
Doch keiner weiß es, weil sie es verheimlicht 
Die Mutter ist schon tot, der Vater arbeitslos 
Er lebt in Alk, zieht Koks 
Sie geht nicht gern nach Haus, denn er zieht sie nachts aus 
Und sagt „Das träumst du bloß“ 
Sie ist verwirrt und will nur, dass es endet 
Schließt ihre Augen und wartet bis er geht 
Er sagt zum Schluss noch 
„Sag es keinem, denn wenn du's sagst, schick ich dich ins Heim“
Sie fängt an zu weinen und sagt nur 
„Mama, wieso lässt du mich hier so allein
Ich will jetzt bei dir sein, Gott schenk mir Flügel
Denn wenn es Gott gibt, hat er auch Gefühle“

Gib ihr die Kraft, die sie braucht (die Kraft, die sie braucht) 

Es ist jeden Tag dasselbe für sie
Sie wollt' es nie so 
Wie ihre Mutter sein, zu Haus allein, schläft jeden Abend unter Tränen ein 
Wächst ohne Vater auf und im Haus der große Bruder 
Keine Liebe von der Mutter, schimpft sie Schlampe und Luder 
Eigentlich ist sie wirklich sweet, wenn man sie lächeln sieht 
Weil sie das Weggehen liebt, kam es vor, dass sie bis spät nachts in den Clubs blieb 
Nur auf der Suche nach Liebe, Geborgenheit und Verständnis 
Lernt sie 'n Typen kennen, die Liebe zu ihm wächst bis unendlich 
Die Erkenntnis viel zu spät, als sie's nach zwei Wochen erblickt 
Dass während sie zu Hause bleiben muss, er ihre beste Freundin fickt
Alles andere als Glück für die kleine Frau mit großem Traum 
Auswandern, Familie, Haus bauen, Liebe und Vertrauen 
Manchmal entspannt sie sich und lächelt, wenn sie im Solarium bräunt 
Als Belohnung für gutes Aussehen gibt's zuhause Schläge vom Freund 
Das letzte was man von ihr fand, es war 'n Satz im Tagebuch 
„Gott, meine Flügel sind gebrochen, bitte erlöse mich von dem Fluch!“

Gott schenk ihr Flügel und hol sie hier raus 
Und lass sie nicht verdursten, gib ihr die Kraft, die sie braucht 
Oh Gott schenk ihr Flügel (Gott schenk ihr Flügel)

Sie fragt „Wie ist dein Name, ich kenn dich von irgendwo“
Ich sag „Kann sein, ich heiß Steve und wir hatten grad ne Show“.
„Wie siehts aus, hast du Lust noch ein bisschen zu tanzen?“
Mit ‚nem bisschen Glück kann ich mit dem Spruch bei ihr landen.
Sie sagt „Ne eigentlich nicht, lass uns lieber noch was trinken“

Fall fast vom Stuhl und merke „Oh Mann, bin ich blau“

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

Raquel Rodriguez,"They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold

Got an issue but it’s getting bigger and bigger
In the beginning it was something minor
Got a rat up in my kitchen and we gotta get rid of it
So we’re bringing in a tiger
There's something inside her
Thought you were blissful
I heard you did it with a pink-handled pistol
But sadness, it tend to latch on
And it won't let go like a pitbull
Don't even know if you left a note
Should we blame the Depakote?
Or vilify the Abilify?
You were trying to find your vanilla sky
Then you unravel
Face down on rock bottom fucking chewing gravel
Because a human's so fragile. What can you do?

They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone

I know it's sappy
But I want my family to be happy
Without becoming flatter than a sheet of paper
An army of zombies shuffling through a vapor
But I know folks who found something beautiful
And they credit the pharmaceuticals
For slaying the demons that they’re running from
It might have saved their lives and I'm one of em
But there's a limit to the shit you can endure
You get a prescription and you're thinking that it’s pure
But baby maybe it’s a problem when you got a problem
And you get addicted to the cure
The spike ain’t not mystery
We’re any penny in a billion dollar industry
And there's a mothafucka on living on the hill pushing pills
Stacking bills off our misery

Had a teaspoon that’s full of pain
Got an ocean that’s full of sorrow
Had a teaspoon that’s full of pain
Got an ocean that’s full of sorrow

They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone",Tears to Diamonds,2014

Es mi última canción para ti
Para ti, para ti

Y fui hasta el infierno y volví
Y decidí que iba a ser feliz
A ser feliz

Tengo tantas palabras por dentro
Me están pidiendo otro centro de control
Que no sea tu corazón
Tengo todas las luces prendidas
Ya mis heridas el tiempo las sanó
Lo pasado, ya pasó
Hoy vuelvo a esto que llaman vida
Hoy te doy mi despedida sin dolor
Es mi última canción para ti",Mi Última Canción,2018
Raquel Sofia,"Si yo te doy mi corazón
¿Dime qué haces con él?
Si yo te aflojo mi botón
¿Cómo lo iras a coser?
¿Cómo me vas a frenar cuando yo salga corriendo, corriendo?

Soy la que salta primero y lo piensa después
Y estoy cubierta de agujeros de cabeza a los pies
Solo te quiero avisar: ya vengo rota por dentro, por dentro

Sabes que amar es un arte
Si esto es real, si tú vas a quedarte
Tengo un universo donde cabes tú
Tengo un pedazo para darte de mi corazón
Mientras más, mejor
Tengo dos bolsillos llenos de tu luz
Tengo mil razones para amarte y darte esta canción
Mientras más, mejor
Mientras mas, mejor

Me vi colgando mi armadura y destilando mi fe
Y así, tejiste mi costura cuando yo te encontré
No me quiero apresurar pero te siento por dentro, por dentro

Darte de este amor

Raquel Tavares,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

São os loucos de Lisboa

Mas o meu silêncio foi maior
E na distância morro todo dia sem você saber

Antes que o dia nos sufoque

Vou me perder de madrugada
Pra te encontrar no meu abraço

Vou me deitar no seu cansaço

Sou dominado ou se domino
Vou me sentir como um gigante
Ou nada mais do que um menino

Chegam mais perto só pra ver
E ainda brilham de manhã

O sol espera pra nascer

Se um outro cabeludo aparecer na sua rua
E isto lhe trouxer saudades minhas

A velha calça desbotada ou coisa assim

Duvido que ele tenha tanto amor
E até os erros do meu português ruim

E a noite envolvida no silêncio
Do seu quarto
Antes de dormir você procura
O meu retrato
Mas da moldura não sou eu quem lhe sorri

Não diga nada
Não vá dizer meu nome sem querer

E até nesse momento você vai
Lembrar de mim

Bring that shit by the neck of my woods

Late at night 
By the back door

Search for a light 
That might show me the way

Shotgun in hand
I left a three time loser

A face that was seen 
But not going to see

Unchain my hands
Now I've got my freedom

Highways I've roamed 
Looking for the distant faces
Gold on the border
And silver in my hands

Meantime I stay
Alone and never changing
And if I did
No one got in my way

Unchain my hands
Now I've got my freedom

The highway is my brother.
I was born to wander,
And it's time for movin' on.
I was born to wander,
Turn around and I'll be gone, gone, gone.

Hey big brother
As soon as you arrive
You better get in touch with the people, big brother
And get them on your side, big brother
And keep them satisfied

Welcome to the beat of the city street
Walk on now and don't be shy
Take a closer look at the people you meet
And notice the fear in their eyes
Watching the time passing by

[Chorus]

Focus your eye on the filthy sky
Just as far as you can see
Everybody's gettin' kind of tired of waitin'
'Cause nobody wants to cry
And nobody wants to die

I know we cannot stay 
But we've got a couple minutes 
And a little time to play 

I know you have important things 
So it's okay, just go 

But we can still pick one small, little thing 
To do with you, y'know! 

One small thing doesn't seem like a lot 
One small thing, work with the time you've got 
Soon, one small thing becomes two 
After two, perhaps another few 
Then one small thing is not so small 
One small thing can be the biggest thing of all 

All right now, since you're here 
Let's see what we can do 
Swim with the flow until you go 
Together, me and you 

I've got necklaces for every fish 
So what else do ya got? 

Well, we could play the bubblefish 
You'll like this one a lot! 

One small thing, it's a good place to start 

(Just one small thing) 

One small thing, and we don't seem so far apart 

(Don't seem apart) 

Soon, one small thing leads to more 
It's so much more than there was before 
Just one small thing, and you will see 
The start of something big for you and me 

One small thing 

Just one small thing

A whee thing, sea thing, me thing (ooh-ooh-ooh)

So many things and everything until our time is done 
There's one small thing for each and everyone! 

One small thing, so much we can create 
You and me, we started something great 
It's so amazing, look around 
At all the happy sights and sounds 
One small thing is big, it's true

Beneath those fears and doubts so just squash 'em

Verse One: Ahmad

Well it's the nigger 'ole that caught Foot Lock
Cause the vibe keeps voxed in funk, makes you rock to the side
Gave it all I had, just to have what I got
Niggaz tryin to be bad, and they mad 'cause they not
Gonna defeat the rapper who got three ways to sack a
Quarterback I slaughter wack MC's with ease
These nuts what you get and a busted lip
What you have when you come at me with buster shit
All that graf given driven so I musta hit
Bought a Jag, chillin on the Shore just to dip
Get it right, cause I get it, night in and night out
I'm butter, covering up wack MC's like White Out
Don't doubt it that they dissed me OK rap is overrated
Who hate it that a nigga from the West blew up and made it
And I'd braid it if I had it but for now I keep it balded
Niggaz tryin to touch to me better stop before they get scalded
I'm hot, like a skillet and grits, crush you to bits
When I look over the room, and then lower the boom, and
Think that they can defeat the man that can't be beat
I do the breaststroke clown while you drown in three feet
Beep beep like robots on Buck Rodgers plus I bust
25th century rhymes so you decline
To battle anytime had skills since I was nine
Dope lines the only weapon that I cock, I never drop
I stop clones 'cause biting's never condoned

And even when I'm maggots, I'ma still be fly
Perpetrator, you're not the one
Your name's not Anfernee Hardaway
I'm like a wolf with blood dripping down the fangs
My techniques foul enough to shoot the flagrant technical
I be comin off the head rougher then ribbed tip recepticles
Expect the exceptional syllables to be the next man's umbilical cord
Catch distortion, ras cancels kids like abortions
Sendin niggaz to hip hop hell, ock
Eternal damnation through writers block
I rock over the results of Reeboks and sands
Stand ill, forget a live band just my mouth and hand
And even man wasn't prehensile
I'd still find ways to grip mikes, hold my tip when I piss
And pick off pubic lice
Cause see, I always been nice but first brothers slept
Now I've come back twice like Christ to resurrect the West

Spit stenches drenches been intricated, flow braggarts
Act cynic thyroid thermia hypodermic
How I earn it squeezing juices, one-hundred
Percent concentrated on easing nooses around the necks
Of tricks, probably won't get this
Thick hottie body carberuator
I'm the un-priggish well cat led bredded-well ill verse my
Will is ho gung for the fortune
Can spell hearse with the same Addams Family apple grapple hook
Crooked, flier I fly crooked
For the crew, Hobo Junction, in a few I'll plan
Father soldier and when they're older I'll teach them off
Killings of confidence and to be omnipotent with content
Accomplishment for gladiation I'm done
With training of explaining as the crates in plan be
Attack instructs me to hit the yak

Intoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ass in your gases 
feel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil 
And what? 
When a nigga place pussy get fucked 
Without a kiss or a hug, like contaminated blood, 
Transfused from a junkie 
With the hair of Jones, I reconstruct the bones 
Of all hip hop clones 

I date fat girls that weight 215 
With low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy 
I'm performing vinyl liposuctions 

Phat MC 

Phat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction 
Needles injected 33 RPM of anestic for ? to require cosmetic 
sex changes from bitch niggas to ra ra niggas 
the only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick 

This shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic 
After Captain Save A Hoe, we had the luitenit

I make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip 
Hopefully, in surgury, I won't slip

For the ones that's over bitin' on dental records 
bitin', to God, send your blessings 
I'll put your mask on, fast like Romidon minks

Uh-huh, it goes down
It goes down
I thought you knew it went down
Believe that

Verse One:

I rock Versacci, sippin VSOP and Hennessey in foam cups
Motorola flips with illegal chips
Dip-pin' like Teela where everybody momma collectin money from fiend
Five series Beemer, one-hundred and eighty-nine horsepower
I like bitched with dimples and nipples the size of silver dollars
Rollin three deep in Eddie Bauers chokin out LAPD Rottweilers
like chihuahuas, all day eryday
In Southern California where the dogs and the ribs stay
And nowadays fools don't know how to act
Cause we all want to be Tony Montana
Matter of fact, gimme five we got dap, gimme twenty-five
We got a bird and profit is made
So while the homey cut cavvy with a razor blade
I rock beats without baking soda
And money gets watched it's only illegal if you get caught
Thought you knew cause the DEA do it too
Keep separate books for the internal revenue
Capitalism is pimps and hoes
In ninety-six I 'spose anything goes

Chorus:

Big bank take little bank       anything goes
Legal or illegal                however you make your cash flow
Big bank take little bank       ahh anything goes
Legal or illegal                however you make your cash flow

Verse Two:

All you PH Ballers, Dirty Mack's need to KG
I'd rather be a dope MC than a broke OG
I get, manicures to keep my cuticle suitable
Player, don't hate me because I'm beautiful
I got a pocket full of see-notes and food stamps
Just big bills and free meals baby so lamp
Cause jealousy gets you burned like bad perms
if you live you learn, I spit game like Chick Hearns
to women with, measurements of 38-24-36 with DSL's
but money talks ESL
In the game of Monopoly, if you don't pass go then go di-rectly to jail
Cause I've seen fools that struggle and turn they ownself into the po-po
It keeps the humble of they cool low
Selling ten dollar J's right up under the man's nose
Hahh, nigga anything goes

Interlude:

One for the money (money), two for the show (show)
Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one
It's one for the money (money), two for the show (show)
Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one

Verse Three:

Niggaz got stripes like, Tony the Tiger
But niggaz got strikes like Oral Hershiser
So look alive, inflation rise like yeast
S&L scandal stole millions
But we need more police to take back our streets, it's drama
We all know that one-time be extortin them big-ballers
Gettin extradited with warrants in three states
Overcrowded prisons hopin the DA drop the case
So uhh, I ain't forgot about the homey Kevin
He pled no contest and got stretched til ninety-seven
Dizmost and Little Dags hold tight
I know I seldom shoot kites but I be tryin to get my pockets right
My ideal real is Big Willie pourin out Dom P
for the dead homies with bitches splittin Phillies (call it ends)
Call it loot scrilla cream green flow or dough

Now you claim I'm runnin' game and still let us run the train 
Pulling Coolio's braids  it wasn't me  it was the fame 
Let a dame complain about disrespecting my African queen 
Ass hangin' out them Daisy Dukes jeans, jockin'
Damn I love civilization

The correct combination unlocked your placenta 
I got a cellular phone with a rubber antenna

When it comes to Saving Hoes Coolio ain't in it 
Don't call me Captain, general, sergeant, or lieutenant 
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
I gave the bitch my autograph, and she gave me some ass

1st Pull:
Niggaz know it's about that time without a Schoolly D Gucci
I pop that pussy ass rapper and leave it up to Luke to Pop the Coochie
Truly a wretched steelo -- kept you Under siege like Seagal
Cause I housed more niggaz than that faggot named RuPaul
y'all all suffer the consequences
I dispense dope sentences without a prescription
prefixes asphyxiate bitches who flips linguistics
Representin the West, relevant to relentless sentences
If renegade rebels resent this wicked syntax (then jack)
Revert to revolution Ras reverse, reverberates
Revolvin with written retalliation, rate repetitious
Reflex flex, regret niggaz regress to less than recoup
When recording, I wreck, records
Reflect stupid, it's so much more than just another rap and sample
Cause I model more styles than Naomi Campbell
See we been burning idiots with lyrical syphillis
Since E.S.T. was Ackniculous, the nickle slick meticulous
ventriloquist when I throws my voice over the Western HemisFear
While my peers step over a Trail of Tears
Go get a job as a chandelier wit a glass jaw like dat
I brings the impact to fracture mandibles, and manhandle the youth
Since my mental exceeds every MC I've perceive credible
Now becomes edible, kid!
And yo, I'm D for wreckin when reputations collide

Ock, I rock hip-hop non-stop and got more juice than Snapple
Intricate to simplistic stylistics I solicit
It gets niggaz open like fallopian ovulation
Fuckin these kids like the Michael Jackson molestations
Sendin ya back as the U.S. Nation did AIDS infected refugee Haitians
Uhh, yeah niggaz so what's the haps
You could put up ya dukes but in the West they bust caps
So bulletproof fists is the only way I'm gone miss, but peep this
My mental's the bullet, my tongue's the finger that pull it
Check the method, soundtrack voodoo uh and bamboo like strapped
Come better you, oh sorry verbal dyslexic

But why they at my door for?
Oh! My peep's they got a half gallon, smilin' 
My talons totalled ten one empty round from putting it down
But now, my day is starting off Coca Cola and Remy Martin
Some of the homeys from L.A. and Carson want to throw a private party today
Threw on some Gautier and my Rolex link dressed to kill like Bernard Getts
My squad flex like Lee Haney, so its best I keeps myself on house arrest

Dialed up some micehead to see what's crackin' tonight 
She said she just broke up with her man
And since she free like Mnadela, she bringina box of Philly pantellas
Acapells, I game like Lou Panella made sure to tell her 
Don't bring no fellas, cherral, girl you can braid the tweed 
And then you can show me how to do the pepper seed
Agreeded, cause we get down like this on a regular, loungin' 
Watchin' bootleged tapes, shooting jokes, your choice of imported smokes
Craps and Celo on the patio for more chips than Bingo
Chips like the MGM casino
Just make sure your homegirl is single, so it's popping

I get around like Dolby Pro Logic,
But running them streets too much get fools hated
Incarcerated, or terminated
At the house we safely intoxicated, Nonoxol-9 lubricated
Playing questions, everybodys faded and now, we got the ladies undressing
Like 1st King strippers bouncin' on nigggas balls like the LA Clippers
The phone rang, my little shorty said ""What you up to, boo?""
Nothing, just chillin' like bruh-man on Martin do
See only when I'm tipsy, when my words start slurring
Do I get causght telling lies like Mark Furhaman
So I'll call you later drink was low, went to the stash and pulled out the
XO
The T.U.'s is down for whatever
Let's run more trains than the metrorail but ya'll got to be out by two

Ras Kass,"Hallelujah when I do ya

[Verse One]
Shit, I ain't never seen an angel, virgin bitches with halos
But my secular metaphysical theology is fatal
Because me with a mic cable is a religious experience in itself
I got a message from God
He said, ""Don't even try to fuck with me,"" suckered reluctantly
Carried the cross and uppercuts and at that, I'm hazardous
I speak to the heads and raise the dead like Lazarus
Led the fucking lambs to the slaughter, and walked on water
When it's frozen, in the ground influence and I'm on point
like the unicorn and you need a form, to bring rains
to Desert Storm for 40 days and 39 nights
So my cerebral flows flood the Earth with a, megahertz
And the first shall be last and the last shall be first
Reciting a biblical verse before I make your melon burst
Like that nigga Jules from Pulp Fiction
My salvation is salivation, indiction crucifixion
It's a blessing just to live another day they say
Because the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away
So my niggaz pray five times a day and still
carry a trey-five-seven (On Earth, As It Is In Heaven)

[Chorus]
(On the planet) Earth, it was my place of birth
Born to be the sole controller, of the universe
        Drinking with the Lord and shoot dice with Christ
Hitting seven, On Earth, As It Is In Heaven

[Verse Two]
Feeling like a cock, cause I be talking to a burning bush
But I'm not knowing till I fornicated with the hoe and
caught the claps so, my first communion consists of
bread and wine and dioxycill in one-hundred milligram capsules
Let the commandments begin again
Cause just like Moses on Mount Sinai, I broke all ten
For the believing, in the evening, when I covet my neighbors wife
I do dirt and get works to reap life, victimize
and give us this day to make our daily bread
Cause if I'm broke I'm serving cavvy in Bethlehem
Or selling my soul to Satan, six figure record deal
protection's my religious denomination, B.C.
I be the coming like when Mary's water broke
So let there be light, so niggaz can see I rock mics religiously
Those who believe ye shall receive
But non-believers, you niggaz doubt my existence like agnostics
The hostile gospel, I apostle, with epistles from speaking in tongues,
but God sewed up and gave his only begotten Son
to set it on niggaz, blowing backwards bastards to Kingdom Come
And knowing the Judas in my crew
So do unto others before they do unto you
Like Rastas heads be dreadin
Phoenetic armageddeon (On Earth, As It Is In Heaven)

I hit the planet like a plague
The Book of Revelations red dragon with ten horns and seven heads
and seven crowns skills concealed until the Seventh Seal revealed
to fulfill prophecy
From B.C. to AC/DC radio receivers
The messiah comes back igniting the fever in the rap world game
(The hit after) The three headed raptor, is after
You hear the HemisFear trinity raps rap to you Babylon fires
Cause thou shalt not worship false idols
Just like David guillotined Philistines even God is homicidal
Fucking these kids like catholic priests after mass
Pubic hair of lamb's wool, and feet of burned brass
That I can put up in your platinum ass son
Instead I arrive the Golden Child, every knee shall bow
when the divine styler is speaking in parables
Like old baptist churches I'm getting old bitches hysterical
HALLELUJAH!  Praise be to my medula oblongota
I blew God and not another nigga hotter, believe that Meshach
The hip-hop martyr who sacrificed and gave my life
But got 4Pac, so I'm livin the Thug Life in the afterlife
Then I be walking through the pearly gates
with an infared scope ten millimeter heater
'cause if my name ain't in the Book of Life I'm snuffing St. Peter
Drinking the blood of Jesus Christ and pissing holy water
no QUESTION who can come cleaner
M-P-see plus M-I-see equals holy be	-I-be	-L-E to me
Matrimony is getting head but I refuse to break bread
with Jezebels, my management already gets twenty percent
so fuck tieing, go to Hell
I'd rather continue backsliding
You're not from the tribe of Judah, so why you lying?
Come watch the Zion, I'm signifying
the next shit to wreck shit and see the Exodus

But three rights make a left
Act your age not your color 
But I'd rather act darker
Mark a page with mazes of labyrinth
Fuck up a rhyme so bad
I leave the microphone abstinent
To MC or not to MC?
Beyond B.E.T. and MTV exists me
Origin
Cause God created man and man created hip hop
I declined to participate until I was orientated
I heard 50,000 drivebys
And 49,999 was lies
No surprise, as the sun rises
Thine eyes have seen the light
But we stalk the night
I expose like an overbite
In limbo I lamp
Rape the lady kill the tramp
The wrong action for the motive
So now
Give me 50,000 black angry role models
Take me to DC I'll throw the first fuckin' bottle
Cause I don't give a fuck about a menial existence
And I don't give a fuck about nonviolent resistance

Subzero catching fatalities to my spirituality
Smoke like a chimney, drink like a Kennedy
Still no remedy 
Fuck shooting a fair one
Cause open cuts from fuckin' some nigga up 
Can lead to contracting HIV positivity
You never know who got traits of femininity
What agwan, pussy wool blood clot 
And deal with the bullshit bodybot business faggot
You play the villain
There will be another soundbwoy killin'
Benadryl pumps through my adrenaline
Feelin' my raps weight 
I track Heavy like Tony Dofat
Hip hop is 2% milk but mostly no fat (phat)
And most MCs ain't prepared 
So what I say goes over your head like pubic hair

Ay how come you won't gimme no pussy tonite?
Aight well shake the spot then, you think you special
I hear your car keys jinglin, get the fuck out
El Drex what you want to do, Shai dog what you want to do?
Kurupt what the fuck you want to do?
Nigga is you a rider nigga?
Is life fucked up

[Kurupt]
They let the gangstas in this muthafucka
Ice Age

[Ras Kass]
I ride for my homeboys (2X)
Nigga its all about the money
Its all about the chips
Lets get rich, what? what

[Kurupt]
With my new Tiny Tim, try again
Up against the full wind, I'm an alien beast
Generate, penetrate, bust shots
Then fled, quick sick in the head
Rippin motherfuckers to shreds
Facsimilies, don't know, friend or foe
Elusive nigga this exclusive, conclusive evidence
Your vision is short range
Rearranged, restructured, recomposed and decomposed
Disassembled, dismembered, reconstructed, polished
Perfected, demolished rejected, fo sho
Like I'm supposed to know this nigga
I ain't neva seen him before --- my life
Bitch ass nigga, who tha fuck you supposed to be?

[Hook:]
'cause niggaz I grew up wit threw up shit
On sum I don't give a fuck shit
Makin enemies duck shit
I'm on some make a million bucks quick
Money gone! Quick get a duck sick trick
Not the one to fuck wit
My dyke bitch pimpin on some Nike Flight shit
Ludicrous iron mic shit..stab yo cold heart wit a ice pick
Tha Ice age!..Ice Age (2X)
Stab yo cold heart wit a ice pick

Now Ben must be either pampered or crushed
To regulate, relegate and delegate power
Nigga touch sumtin, touch no one and die slower
You drain your battery you barely talkin like Teddy Ruxpin
See that's whattup nigga I don't give a fuck
Spit some shit so nasty it will make Lil' Kim blush
As if a 98 Bentley didn't tempt me
To lay bullshit up in dis 60
But consequently my conscience didn't permit me
I'm one third black man, one third Jackie Chan and one third sand
Shitftin across the surface of tha land
Golden state warrrrior!!
Let my nuts hang like niggas in nuiscance
So why uou givin groupies all your lucci?
I've been known for fuckin hoochies in Suzukis
And slippin bougie bitches roofie
Loved yet feared severe yet loved
The full time titan, fightin 3 million over night thugs
So get your hand out your rectum cause you can't stop shit
Don't rock shit, 
studio hustlaz claim they got more ki's than a locksmith
What part of the game is this, overtime
Gimme the mic, the money the pussy and the order
The more the overpopulated, get fucked and ovarie-copulated
So all you chumps on some you owe me and apology shit
Suck your apology out my dick!

[Ras Kass]
We all pawns in the game, but every pawn got his personal chess board
But how many pieces can you afford?
We got reason to believe you a traitor
In 20 words or less Webster's definition of a playa hater
The reason why you hate me so bad is cause you love me too much
But don't like yourself enough
And homey that's it, your hands probably got callouses
from the way you be swingin on my dick
That's why your main squeeze want to fuck me for free
Slit the finger on my monkey then she dropped to one knee
If she playin wit her pussy, she can suck on my D
Then you can CUM wit ME..until you P H see!

They want to know where Drex is, he's out fuckin in Texas
I'm iller than AIDS so you don't really want to catch dis
Drivin in a Lexus wit niggaz that drive reckless
I was thinkin murder back when Melle dropped ""The Message""
Money bossin', see-me-arson, worse than Stone Cold Steve Austin
John Gotti, drinkin notti, pullin holes through your body
West coast silly bitch, East coast silly bitch
I ain't Big Willie bitch, Drex gona kill a bitch!

Is that my cash ya got?
Is that my hash ya got?
I hate to make you take yo shit off my man

She had me only, almost losin' my cool
Remi and Moet wit brew, shootin' pool
Ask me if I wanted a dance, yeah
Made my way to her chair, sugar shake it over here
Fell in love wit the clothes that she didn't wear
Beat the fat derriere, while I whispered in her hair
Hope it all about Chippers, I'm tryin' to kick it after I tip ya
Pour ya in my champagne glass and sip ya
Tropical, clockin', Latin American mami, Sevita from Guyana
Move like good sex, plus her eyes do the rest
Baby soft flesh, you could rest, who the best
Honey straight bangin' ya, puffin' the Buddha pest, tatas danglin'
Started to flow, she promised not to hurt me
Wrapped her legs around my neck, and worked me, wit a lapdance

[Chorus: RC:]
The Henny got me in a zone, I want to take you home
So we can be alone, for my lapdance
I think I got another dime, just do it one more time
The only thing that's on my mind, is my lapdance

[Ras Kass:]
Face cameras on, raspberry lipstick
Had to be twisted, ""Not really"", she insisted
Experimented a little, but never kissed it
Do I have a girlfriend, she can be my mistress
Pop the P, like it's just for me
'Bout three G's, hangin' out of G-string V
I don't see nothin' wrong wit the hump
Damn, sweetie, don't brake you high heel pump
Gotta keep it crunk though
When the DJ pay, she next on stage
After the song she gotta go, meet you at bar when I'm done
1-51, tie cherries in a knot wit her tongue
Work the poll like Dominique Dawes, without drawers
Applause, brakin' niggas like laws
We fantasize for the chance to romance
But it cost 10 dollars for another lapdance

[Chorus]

[RC:]
I've been your fool, you know you gotta pay your dues
You want to get wit Ras and Rueb
Then you must choose, and you know you can't loose
There's somethin' bout the way that you shakin' your rump
It makes me feel good 'cause I likes to hump
The way you move your body in a sexy way
It makes want to lapdance everyday

[Ras Kass:]
She said 5 for the top, 10 for the bottom
Looked her up and down, said ""Hmm, I got 'em""

[RC:]
And she worked the nightshift
A dish water blonde, tall and fine
She made a lotta till, ask her what you gotta say, nigga

[Ras Kass:]
First of all, she 5'8"", I'm 5'6""
But if I put on my Prince heels, can we go on a dance
Had her laughin', like Ras you off the hook
I got 101 positions, that'll leave you shook
Off the books, I'm all yours on all fours
Wit nine chords, so, me and more
Keep it real wit me, pick me up at three
Scooped up in the Lex, and got served for free OohWee

[Chorus]",Lapdance,1998
Ras Kass,"Yeah once again presenting  
Kid Capri 
Ras Kass the waterproof M.C. 
Punchline 

These fagot M.C's be on skis with the microphone though 
But it's all downhill hitting trees like Sonny Bono 
Name a nigga I couldn't burn and he probably created the Earth in six days 
I shot at Jesus with a tech fives times 
Hanging the pope with six strings  the name is Ras Kass 
Might eat a little pussy but I don't kiss ass homeboy 
I'm righteous and wicked and this acquisition of riches is like 
Selling bean pods and still fucking white bitches 

I rap crazy, you better get fifty niggas to blaze me 
Or ace me, been rhyming since 220 AD 
You feel gazy?, I'm top ten with the raps 
Off the list you scratch, like serial numbers on gats 
I lace tracks with ill lines 20 bar rhymes 
My verses got long sentences like jail times 
Press rewind, listen to jams when I cool out 
I only fuck a bitch in the park if she juiced out 
Going new routes to maintain my composure 
Anticipated while you still screaming to get exposure 
Rap soldier in the cipher I'm first to set it 
My lyrics get the U.S. Open without playing tennis 

Vindictive my voice pitch is beyond John Blaze 
I'm John Cremation, you conversation with aspirations 
Of me leaving blood stains from Earth to Venus 
Them so-called rap stars will still be living 
with they moma like an unborn fetus 
As soon as you step on stage I'ma destroy you with the truth 
Like the Ricki Lake show, don't come out the soundproof booth 
Or poof, plucked in your bubblegoose 
A lost angel, I strangle at an angle that's obtuse 

Yo, my styles viscous, put niggas before bitches 
Collect riches, bone chickens without trickin' 
And stay spitting mad rhymes in your direction 
Always repping get you open like seasections 
I rhyme greata set it off without Jada 
My flava' leave a nigga shook like vibrators 
Rap composer of the hit your styles over 
I make an M.C. cry just like Robin on Ophra 
Give you the cold shoulder guess who rhymes slicker 
I gross figures, shed light on shady niggas 
And write rhymes, roast niggas that take mine 
Gave birth to so many styles I should have my tubes tied 
One time, when rappers need concentration 
Embarrass I nigga, like getting caught masterbating 
I'm fascinating, I make you wallow in your sorrow 
Clutch the bottle you get your childish style fondled 
My rap tactics make you want to go home and practice 
Match this, drop jewels like Biago Rackis 
I come rough for all niggas that front 
I'm all that five mics and quotable for the month 

I be on some bullshit like the unamits and vigorous rhyming 
And until Buchwhick Bill starts dunking on Kobe Bryant 
I'm applying pressure, check out my melody 
The eighteenth letter, the first letter 
the nineteenth letter for cheddar 
And get a barrette explosive tip shredders to make the rum-redder 
To make the deader then Coretta 
Scott King's husband who had a dream 
I get in you with no Vaseline 
And burn rubber so I tap that ass like Savion Glover  

That the sedative cause your shits repetitive 
And played out, tried to run game but it got rained out 
Wasn't thinking about this style until we came out 
Took a detour when some of y'all went the same route 
Thoughts about doing Punchline make me tickle 
When my flow changes like pennies, dimes and nickels 
Organized rhymes we make the girls realize 
We humiliate niggas like a small dick size 
Now you want to click nines, front and sip wines 
Take mine, can't mess with Ras and Punchline",One on One,1998

I toss fire at niggaz; motherfuck the six

The condos is supposed to be flip bricks
All thirty-nine of your bitches, pretty-ass bitch nigga 
I'll throw some fucked up kicks on
Next is a small tank top, the spot, shot it up

Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up
'Cause we don't give a fuck, the Headless Horseman Kurupt
See I'm off the wall nigga, Horsementality
I'm a Horseman nigga and that's all I'll be

See I'm tired of the sparkly shit, niggaz talkin shit
I want to see the streets dark again
Let the heaters spark again, police callin all cars often
Powerful as a motherfuckin Vulcan

My specialty is - poetically lyrically energetically 
Ultra magnetically Dogg Pound pedigree
Fuck the shiny shit, fuck a bitch, only grimy shit
Dirty shit, holocaust in thirty-thirty shit

Missile flick assassin Sicilian
Kill women and kill men, and kidnap children
For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen
Slice your Achilles tendon, the Headless Horseman

And we abide by, the code of the streets
The makings of a real MC (C...C...C...C) yeah bitch!

[Canibus]
So just abide by what you ride by
Cause we abide, by what we ride by
Just abide by what you ride by
Cause we abide, by what we ride by

[Killah Priest]
What the fuck y'all done started; four apocalyptic prophets
Appearin out of floatin' objects, wearin' Middle Eastern garments
Long trench coats with our hands in our pockets
Slappin' all you scary-ass rap artists, half-retarded

Swear by our forefathers
Anything you speak, think, or show will be disregarded
Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness
Bring you out the other side, as a carcas

I'm heartless, regardless if y'all claim to be Gods or Goddess
To me, y'all all garbage; I see all of y'all as movin targets
And my lyrics be the atomic rockets, cosmic vomic - spittin'
Hittin' at y'all Vietnam vets

Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest
Castin' meteor storms and comets
Now who want to make the next ras comment
And be the first one left unconscious?

After I squeeze your head like the Charmin
Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat
And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts
Satanically sacrifice your ass like an occult

Have your seance inside of a dark synagogue
We was lyrically sent to y'all
Like the Men of God to put a end to y'all
I sniff bites like dogs to get the scent of y'all

Horsemen, we be scorchin when we be walkin'
With the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin

Let's air it out like the breeze
Now watch me do one-armed handstands 
And hang these N-you-T's over seven continents and seven seas
Streets is Lebanese

Be rockin Bulgari wrist watches and sniper marines
Most of these MC's can't even rap, just model and go gold
And get big-headed like they swallowin colleges
I spit empty gravesites, rap stars fill 'em up

You what? Thirty, forty years old and still wack as fuck
Me? I ain't even in my prime
When I write my dopest rhyme, Western civilization declines
Catch me hoppin off the A train in a New York state of mind

But I rep Westside, so I keep L.A. time
That's a three-hour difference;
So when my bitch is a six, she's really a nine
In seven days, she'd still be a dime

Call me Blaze Skywalker hittin jugular veins
Crack open your skull wit a paper weight and suck out your brains
Kiddo, I be doin my thug-thizzo for shizzo
And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow

So what's happening, from P.I. to '99 Madden
Since police be jackin blacks, I talk to pigs in Pig Latin:
Uck-fay ou-yay itch-bay at-lay a-igga-nay-play, 
And free Keith Mur-ray (Horsemen)

Yo, yo, yo

Make lightnin flash across the sky everytime I curse
Six-hundred and sixty-six flashes

To the backs of six-hundred and sixty-six Master of Ceremony has-beens
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
If he's a *Catholic* I nail him to a crucifix

Then I beat him till he's blackish-blueish

I'm a fuck all of you pussies like group sex
You get six-hundred and sixty-six years imprisonment

For biting off another nigga's shit, you bitch
You got caught, now you on the other side of the law
Snitchin on mad niggaz in a soundproof court
To get some of your sentence knocked off (nah nigga) you wildin

But you still be in Riker's Island gettin forced to toss salads
You scared of that, wit a phobia fear of that
I'm a tape it on the digital video DAT
And send a copy to Miramax - leave you exposed

Turn all the fiction to fact, so everybody will know

That got fucked in the ass by your father figure

Deliverin mind blowin rhymes and poems 
Controllin my tongue when I'm flowin like pilot controlled Boeings

Guess who's the man this winter, straight out the land of sinners
The Range is tan with spinners, check out the white mirrors
Blow with the damn winners while you and your man's finished
Two in your Rams fitteds, turn off your lightswitch
Holdin my torch down, even when the force 'round
You let your wife roam, she want a divorce now
You niggaz ain't this gully, play it I paint your skully
You never take this from me the riders and all the gangsters love me
You shouldn't be a problem, I ain't be a problem
See you later I'll red your head, you'll be a Rodman
I know your type, hoppin all over beat screamin
You call it hypin yourself up, I call it street dreamin
I do it for all the haters, the players roll with the gators
They lookin forward to favors, gossip is all they gave us
You niggaz wasn't quiet, meet the whales and the fishes
You leak the precinct up, play tattletale with the snitches
Even my momma knows, I got all kind of hoes
They wait outside of shows strict after the diner close
I'll get designer clothes, without the wine or rose
Take off my baby blue mink, and Carolina vogues
come here, take a look inside a entertainer's closet
I never trust a bitch, I blame Lorena Bobbitt
Niggaz stay in pocket, I know you're mad at me
But shit ain't all peaches and cream, and I ain't Sara Lee
Bitch!

[Chorus]
Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one
It's a lot of girls here, go and get a grown one
We at the bar poppin bottles 'til they all gone
If you ain't leavin here with us, you can walk home
Cause someone else will, they know how we ride
If you a playboy, you got one on the Eastside
Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride

.. (what) right .. (what) right .. (what) right .. (right, damn!)
(Let's go)

[Verse Two]
I do this for the hood, niggaz stuck in the slammer
I smile cause I'm good, you act tough for the camera
Run from the lil' kids, they fuckin with Santa
Cause they like 2Pac more - word?  Word to my grandma
I figure I might as well leave here with my glock drawn
Cause they'll take to jail, even when you're not wrong
Dawg you're not this flashy, jux you got to blast me
Every rock is classy nobody on your block can match me
You shouldn't want a fight, unless you want to fight
for your life in the hospital a hundred nights
I know your type, run behind your girl rushin
You call it quality time, I call it handcuffin
I'm on a beach in Miami, so you ain't reachin my family
All weekend with panties from Puetro Rican Cammie
You niggaz wasn't tough, I shoulda snapped two flicks
You wore your pants tight, played pitty-pat with the chicks
Even my father knows, where the revolver goes
I bring the beef to your front door like dominoes
And my diamonds froze, that mean my time is froze
Me in the club from when it's poppin 'til the time it close
Half of these so-called real niggaz'll probably sing
Nah I ain't pullin over, learned that from Rodney King
So tell your homey chill, you know I hold the steel
Everything be jabs and hooks, and you ain't Holyfield
Nigga!

[Chorus]

Everybody on the left get yo' hands up
Everybody on the right get yo' hands up
Everybody up front get yo' hands up
And everybody out back get yo' hands up
And if you in here with a strap get yo' hands up
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
... man fuck what he said man, put 'em up!
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)

Ras Kass,"These fuckin' snakes man
Fuckin' up our lives
I'll take a piss in your oil fields
I want some motherfuckin' payback so, yo

I wanna run for president, and the focal point when I'm campaigning
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation at Camp David
Demand payment for New Orleans with the best of swordsmen
Launching missiles at the White House while Tech's performing
On the lawn and I just let 'em burn till death's confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause otherwise they'll never learn
I'll form a cruel intent, put anthrax through the vents
From out a package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
I'd let 'em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Let's fuck with them, have the first lady beat me off
Till my semen's launched, then I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I won't leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her trout bleeding out on Condoleezza's couch
I'll seek this route without regrets, and drink a brew then think of you
Cause if it's the last fuckin' thing I do I'll

Yeah, Immortal Technique, Rassy
Nigga, I never forget nothing nigga

Fifty-one percent of the World Bank is owned by the U-S treasury
Robbing third world countries out all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fighting the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin'
We even called 'em freedom fighters
Financed the cost with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran Contra Scandal, niggas took the blame
Started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russia's defeated, America thinks more oil for us
Take over, set up a public government, Arabs ain't bearing it
So the same freedom fighters, George W. call 'em terrorists
Poetic justice, payback's a bitch, these fuckin hypocrites
Like Bill O'Reilly, right-wingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh, drug addict, Giuliani, sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists then show you how my tech's handled
My neck's nano-technologically designed
It spits SARS to all you stupid ass execs that capital resigned

I am vindictive, faggots!

Huh, ha ha ha
Yeah I got something for you motherfuckers ha ha
You want it? Here you go!

The first payback that I would accomplish
I'd draft children from the senate and congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I exposed Joe Cephas for ghost writing the Bible
Making nuclear silos, bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon sized blunts in Maracaibo
Huh, and everyone flashing a gun on a D-V-D
I'd make them niggas shoot it out with N-Y-P-D
And every fucker that didn't buy my C-D
I'd stab the revolution in their neck with an I-V
See me, own the world, I'd give it back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core, fuck with the gay list
Niggas pop on they block but they globally nameless
I'd show the hood real gangsters and make 'em famous
Langley Virginia, where my connect for cocaine is
I'd make everybody fuckin' have the world darkening
I make rap-about lyrics, not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgin's broken hymen
Holding De Beers reclining, while they choke on they diamonds
My designing's like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a universe inside solitary confinement
I'd reverse Rockefeller laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the President free styling off a the dome

A message to the outgoing president
Hey I got a great idea nigga
Kill yourself
Ha ha ha, you know it's so funny, 
I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Ah why don't you kill yourself?
Ha ha ha ha ha, kill yourself",Payback,2008
Ras Kass,"I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed
My patience led the way until the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches
It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between

When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
Sky blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B R double-O K-lyn in the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became

Panic on my first campaign, but when the words fell to place
I was certain to reign, I hit the purple, 
Then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong

Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They on welfare, you got health care
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where
I wrote this rhyming where I first saw my vision
Buy a better living, a place to raise kids in

So I think like I rule the world
On the brink of something bigger, building schools
For boys and girls the thought of home gets me out of my bed
I said you got them tools? 
Get them shits up out of the shed, come on 

I'm like the interstate of rhyming the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit costumed out eventually money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler a rich owner, loaner
Used to pump at coffees shops had my bitch 
Who sell with me rolling up fly ass and still classy
Asking questions like, ""Why you wait on that glass?

Why you splash me?"" Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'mma teach you like how I was taught too
Hold the phone, ward two, seeing all kinds of great fossils
Colossal juice, ? the house, act fly
Got you, no need to walk backwards, fuck with the taxes 
I speak credibility, the story to másses
Yo, a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A scully good denim jean on and ?

They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life enable your seed's
So I lean on blacks and feed em the deeds
So when I die they got a foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, plus my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but ? experienced fools
And I be rhyming cool, but my philosophy's deep
Like a dear John letter, so read em and weep

And the wolf smells blood, you can feed em to me
We can meet in the street, draw heat, but what happened to peace?
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrhea, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion had the wine, made the sign of the cross
And I will live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from ""Please listen to my demo!"" to stretch limo

To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Timbo slice
Like Geena Korrano, a cyborg determinate
Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald over one billion served
But it's up to me to get what I deserve
So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm

42nd street and she's all alone on the bad side of town cause
There was a little boy that she loved with all her heart but
He's far away with another girl now she's searching for a
Friend just to hold her when she cries in her lonely nights,
Lonely nights where no one seems to care in her lonely nights,
Lonely nights you better beware but baby you try and you try 
But it seems that it doesn't work cause love is a game that
They play so baby hold on to your heart when they tell you
That they care yeah now that you know that the winner takes
What he wants but she's searching for a friend just hold her
When she cries in her lonely nights, lonely nights where no
One seems to care in her lonely nights, lonely nights you
Better beware and somewhere in the night there's a little cry
 A girl who says hey I wanna die there's no one here who cares
 But if there's someone here who understands just someone here
Who'll try to lend a hand and bring her home tonight, tonight

I'd wear down my knees every night even if I had no hands to pray
If my friends were dead and gone leaving me here alone
Could I depend on some spirit to ease me when my soul's on its own
If my eyes were blind and I couldn't feel at all to see
Nothing in this world but you complete me

Know he acting groupie-ish taking a sip out Luda's Cris

Hating on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face

I'm a ri-i-der, I'm a rider
I'm too tough for y'all, and I will never fall
You can talk that talk, but I'ma walk that walk
And I'm riding, that's fa sho
I'm a surviiiii-iiii-vor, true survivor
If I walk out that do, and don't come back no mo
Let the liquor po, and let the people know
I was a rider, that's fa sho

We them niggas getting hated by haters, we them niggas that done made it outrageous
Stack the money in the streets nothing honey nothing sweet, I'm sick my chips contagious
Animals none of y'all can't cage us, got me feeling like the Heat and the Lakers
Had to switch up my team but what do ya mean, we already traded them traitors
Spend a lifetime surrounded by fakers, in the night time you high 'cause it's safer 
Spend a lifetime to grind and get paper, while all y'all crying I'm flying to Jamaica
Grinding steadily fine and cheddar he, know how to show ya the nine is deadly
Wanna be a pussy nigga fine then let it be, anybody crying that's around it's never me
Realer than the rest when it come to plex, get it off your chest if you so upset
Is that what it gon' be if it comes to yes, then I guess that day will become a mess
They messed up when they told me the sky's the limit, 
'cause I'm married to my money nigga I'm committed
If it's gold at the end of the rainbow then my gang go, get up in the vehicles and ride to get it
I'm a nigga that made it up from the bottom, I'm a always get into a lil' drama
Y'all don't know what it means to be a rider, gotta deal with anybody that got a problem
I'ma put supreme in the Impala, I'ma put some cream up in the bomber
Jack it that's it nigga go get a dollar, looking for me I'm busy my nigga holla

[Chorus]

Got the weight on my shoulder like solo flex, do the drama myself that's solo plex
I don't know what you do fo' yo checks, but my part of the do' way mo' they less
I'm gripping wood I know I'm fresh, 'cause I am that CEO and yes
The mo' I make they more upset, but I'll be damned if a nigga don't show respect
Ask the streets in the South about the kid, and they gon' tell ya I be doing my thang
We could do the beef or we could do the peace, as long as you ain't speaking my name
My partna told me you was jocking homie, and my other boy said the same
The result of that when I approached the cat, I gotta hit him with the pain like bang-bang
Physically and mentally, a rider a nigga that'll tell 'em see
I bomb on your ass it was meant to be, because I told y'all niggas not to mess with me
Do you let the beef slide, and let it die down with all your deciding
In the streets they know Cha-millionaire be riding, Batman my heat riding like Robin
Tell 'em that I got 'em if he's on my team, 'cause loyalty's something that you're gonna need
Loyalty's something others don't believe, like a ghost that most suckers ain't known to seen
But you know that a rider can notice hating, and use it to fuel all the motivation
Success is something that's fa sho to make em, back down they don't then I'm gonna break em",Rider,2005

I've always been the quiet type till now

I never let anybody know

I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt

Than it did in the old days 
So naturally, we have more natural disasters 
From the strain of a fast pace

Now, it's one more day for progress 
And we can't slow down ?cause more is best 
It's all an endless process

Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke 
Where everything is black and white 
Picking on a six string 
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name 
Watching the clouds roll by 
Bye, bye 

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting 
Through the trees as the wind blows 
That's when I climb up here on this mountain 
To look through God's window 
Now I can't fly 
But I got two feet that get me high up here 
Above the noise and city streets 
My worries disappear

Checkin' out the bands on Dull Hinney Avenue.

Wishing old wishes,

A girl with no hair to the prom

For just this morning, right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny
And Sara Beth closes her eyes

And she dreams she's dancing
Around and around without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And a soft wind is blowing her hair

It's quarter to seven, that boy's at the door
And her daddy ushers him in
And when he takes off his cap
They all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly she touches just skin

And they go dancing, around and around
Without any cares
And her very first true love is holding her close
And for a moment she isn't scared",Skin (Sarabeth),2004
Rascal Flatts,"I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars

A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards

It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at

You get your pride back

You get your life back

Red wine buzz kickin' in
A little Sarasota moonlight
Driftwood fire burnin'

She was on break from Ohio State
And I was down there sellin' para sail rides
Just another summer day
'Til I strapped her in and watched her fly

Nearly took the house down with it

The day she parked on I-65
Found her on the shoulder cryin'
She didn't know where she was

It's like her mind just quit
Oh, but bring up Grandpa
It's like someone flipped a switch

A front porch light and a blue DeSoto
Couple of straws in a Coca-Cola
You could see it all goin' down

A tear on his face, down on a knee
Shaky voice, a diamond ring
She'll put you in that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948

She takes out his medals
A cigar box of letters
Sits and scatters pictures
Black and whites of days gone by

We started losing her when she lost him
But to hear her carry on
You'd swear she's seventeen again

Football games and leaves are cracklin'
Walking her home in his leather jacket
You can see it all goin' down
A perfect night on a front porch glider

Sayin' goodnight for the next three hours
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright
When she talks about that town
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today

We've seen it for a while
But there are no regrets between us
We can leave here with a smile
We have to talk about it
What we've always known
The hardest part about today
Is tonight we'll be alone
Alone

We were just two hearts
Bound for different roads
Oh why they didn't lead us to forever
We may never know
Oh I will carry you with me
I will hold on to our memories
Don't let the dreams we didn't find
Make you feel like giving up
Keep holding on and
Don't lose your faith in love

Life's gonna move on
And the pages start to turn
We'll be stronger people now
From the lessons that we've learned
This one's gonna hurt
It's a little deeper break
But just know I'm praying for you
As I watch you walk away

Make you feel like giving up
Keep holding on and
Don't lose your faith in love

It can hold you, it can save you
From anything or anyone

That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows, walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times, even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to reach
Was you, right here in front of me

And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breakin'
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me here, right here

It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by

I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now, there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms that way

In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me

I could tell he'd been through some hard times
'Cause there were tear stains on his old shirt
And he said, you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards

You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back

You get your hair back
You get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing

Your bling, bling, bling and a diamond ring
You get your farm, and the barn
And the boat, and the Harley
And that old black cat named Charlie

It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards

Well, I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said, wait a minute, that's not all
There's even more

You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart
You get your pride back

You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD
And a washing machine

You get the pond, and the lawn
The breaker, and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy

A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Oh play that song!

We sat there and talked
About how it would be
If we could turn it all around
And go back T-I-M-E

You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back

Rascal Flatts,"I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through

I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
That every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes it did

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
And others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know it's true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yeah

And now I'm rolling home
Into my lover's arms

Rascal Flatts,"There's nothing in my life I'd say I regret
But there's something in your eyes that makes me forget 
The times that I believed that love was good as love could be
I had it all but I was wrong

Thought I'd been touched
Thought I'd been kissed
Thought I'd been loved
But it was nothing like this

You can't describe the sea unless you've been there before
It's just a mystery until you're standing on the shore
And moved by every wave
Taking your breath away
Like you do to me

Thought I'd been touched
Thought I'd been kissed
Thought I'd been loved

Who can get you what you need

I saw a red Camaro today
It turned my head around it made me think
About back when my life was a game
And we played it all night long just like
Our favorite song. Summers just around the bend
Summers just around the bend.

Turn up the music loud
Take the T top down
And let the chrome shine
Cruise along the river side
Feel the wind blow
Through your hair through your toes
Got your bare feet hanging out the window
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I saw a red Camaro today
And I did a double take
I thought I saw her face
We were so reckless and young
And it all comes back to me
In storm wash memories

Take the T top down
And let the chrome shine

Through your hair through your toes
Got your bare feet hanging out the window

Sweet wine and sunshine
Looking back looking back
Man those were some good times

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, and hear the Angels' voices

Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh night divine

Truly He told us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus sing we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Rascalz,"Its like clockwork, movin, the hands of time
Four MCs, four minds combined in rhyme(x3)

And it goes,like this
I'll take it straight to that face plate
Snatch and make it detach (what now)
Cause what i bring's the natural dispatch
I'm magical
Word up, I got It like that
I'm just sayin what's on my mind 
When I rhyme
And that's the bottom line
Heavy stress got a nigga thinkin that he must be trippin
I'll be runnin rings around the rhymes that they be whippin
And they know it
But still they must be frontin
Cause I'm sayin somethin
That they don't want to hear
So now there's nothin (nothin)
But opposition to my every way of life
I'm sayin I'm a bring it on cause I must
Yo I'm bustin rhymes 
Cause its fresh when you def with linguistic, artistic
I mean this rap thing, is the shit kid (word up)
Gettin paid is a priority
No Doubt
So run that route
Well quit the runnin at the fuckin mouth
Yo It'll never be the same, like it use to be
Too many half steppers that want to be up in the industry
So yo i drop some science every demo i make
It's like, how you livin homes
Kinda trife and it ain't that great
I want to mansion and a yacht and all that bullshit
The niggas compromise they own integrity to get it
Now maybe that's the price to be paid for the riches
Sell your fuckin soul to the Devil
Now those suns a bitches (word)
Are tryin to tell me that my rhymes is to abbrasive and aggressive (what?)
My street warrior attitude ain't impressive

I move onto the scene like a graphic
I flow like traffic
I'm at my peak each and ever hour
When I get a rush
I gotta bust with the midas touch
Grab a hold of the steal an grip it with the camels clutch
Let em feel
Hear and bear witness
As I reveal the sickness
That's been quaratined and revealed
When I redeam
By Red who's One with creation
In time in this space
And rhymin a nation
Forever chasin
Hip Hop
Until da final act of death
Takes my last breath
Odesables of saren vega make me go def
With nothin left
But the force that creates life
Which is the soul
Takes me to the next life
Where I will still rock your bone
The side is told
But not believe
Its the grasp and behold
The energy they envy
Manafested in me
>From the donnig of time
'Till the dusk of eternity
Def scripts there will only be

We move like clockwork
Individual gears movin in sync
Condition
And executed with procision
The regular recital of rhymes remains
One of the many mechanisms used to escersize the brain
So stay wise

Because they don't stop
Hip Hop, you don't stop (stop)

Checkmate sets it

Revolves with the record
Clockwise
Retro grave rotation
Known to be not wise
Open your eyes
Before the alarm sounds
Countdown, the year 2000
The path gets dramatic
Time to drop mathematics
I figure
Four MCs in a circular configure-ation
Is an eventuall progression
Time is of the essence
Its the essence of this profession
To help make suggestions
Evolve from shadows
The day is now digital
Whatever the means
Times is still critical
So don't clock this work
But take it for what its worth
Clockwork
So syncronize your inc and rise
don't blink your eyes
Cause we're on the brink of demeise
So sit and re-think the lies
Flipout, is what would describe me best
So let me Flipout
and take this mess from my chest
Clockwork
Movin like the hands of time
Four MCs combined together in rhyme

Its like clockwork
we stockin up the rhymes
But the clerk at the counter be the misfit
Spellin out rhymes from the mind
So check it
If you want to get jerked by the collar
Then gettin pulled from behind
The Misfit (Misfit)
You try to holla at the boys
Checkmate, Red, Flipout
Yes, indeed Misfit
So instead I think you should step
To the side (to the side)

Dreaded fist from the Northwest...

First before my verse, make Boodah bless you
Because he blessed me, in form of smoke from a tree
With abilities to summon powers of the Dreaded Fist
As a lyricist, to the world as a terrorist
So from a distance, you see shrapnel and debris
And in an instant you've got to recognize it's me
Black Belt, afferent to the eighth degree
The champion is me, Red One
Because I be the, a veteran, me all veteran
I'm gettin' on with the knowledge
To make moves strong, and abolish
Terrorizing tracks like Gengis Kahn
We be the rawest, hardest from the Northwest Side, dun
And that's, word to the uplifted fist of the dread, clear
Cutting emcees like McMillan and Blodell, so go tell
a friend, and so on and so on
The movement of this Dreaded Fist no longer will be slept on

[Chorus, Red One]
Dreaded Fist of the Northwest
Gotta be cautious
How we exhibit our style to the people
Lethal doses leaves comatose hits
To match the Fist, there's no equal to this

[Misfit]
A way with words is chosen right to explain
Poetry in my motion, coasting
In and out of range, to maintain
I switch up the timing
Keep surprising, line by line
A continuous jabbing unto you, into your pressure spot
I pinpoint with an index finger
Inject, to let the rhyme linger
Lyrically, do a number, in the ring
Physically, the champion of Welterweights in my division and skill
Aging to get better, somehow, someway
Maybe this Dreaded Fist will meet it's match someday
So then I stay, and with my words I don't play
Though I fate, and patiently wait for made mistakes

""Flip back, get into a fighting position""

[Red One]
Slip me in the chamber
Cock it back, toss me instrumentals, and watch me bust on that
They must (be) on crack, wanting they wigs split back
Cause we run this, and it's a well known fact
Never miss, all veteran and specialist
Messing with the best? Please, you can't handle this
It's too scandalist and dangerous for those trying to be framing us
Enslave us, lining up our anuses and bust
But, I don't think so
Who the fuck you think this is?
It's the Rascal, Red One, baddest in this rap biz
Rap with the Misfit, I get the beats off of Kemo
Stay froze and oppose like we boys of Serrengettal
Rock like metal, plus we heavy on the pedal
The chosen, to rule over the bass and the treble
For those and, for those and those who be opposing
They scared cause they know we eat the mic like errosion

[Chorus, Red One]

[Misfit]
We are the Dreaded Fist style lyricists
Once we start to kick the flows, continuous and dangerous
To be facing us you see, easily pick apart, your gameplan
It seems to me, you can't withstand the sting of the jab
I see the stagger, in your step, you cannot fool
A master of deception, expect the to fall
I'm going for the sternum, flexin'
Verbal skill, it is also an anotomical weapon
I hope I knock some, sense into ya
Coming way, pay attention to the rhymes that we say
Representing from this day forth, the Dreaded Fist
FitnRedi, on the mission

""Flip back, get into a fighting position""
""Put on a bulletproof, it'll bust your chest""

[Chorus, Red One]",Dreaded Fist,1997
Rascalz,"As we emerge from the woodwork
Step in to the front
Take control
Its like clockwork
Well I knock first
To pre-warn of my presence
About to enter
And overflow the trauma center
So recommend ya to think twice
FitnRedi dishin out rhymes by the slice
But of course
There's a price  
For everything now
And with the beats from Kemo
They're made to entice
The fealin of temptation
And the thoughts of should I or shouldn't I
Gotcha complicated
Yea, the rhyme's stated
Opposition can't debate it
The jealous hate it
While the ignorance is there
Rated are for Renegade
Red-1 rock steady
Connect wit the fit
Never miss cause we ready
To grab the mic
And show you who got the clout
Dwell, drown last minute in this world title bout
So sound the bell
An lets do this
Taken
Whoever got bones to pick
Like an archiologist
Speak now
While we be on the topic
And if not
Shut ya mouth while we drop it

Chorus:
When I plan my attack I doubt that ya ready
Red-1 and Misfit come into this we rock steady 
When I plan my attack I doubt that ya ready
So think it over before you make moves of a soldier

I snatch the mic
With the blindedness
Speed of the mantis
Pray my things don't cross ya path
For bigets
Were in my favor
The closer we stand
To dividedly running
Is my specialty
So test me
Show inflexability
Rappin and kickin simple similies
At all you lazy
And to the non beleiver
Yes
Its the one and only
None of the rest
Run parallel to me
Like an analogy
I got to be
Coming in first
Its my hobbie
So the last one of the block
Simply cause I'm cocky
Floating
A butterfly stinging like a ??????
I told you long time
You must go down
Before my science
Leavin you deaf
Comin blind

Yea
Set of this ritual while burnin insence
Drop to my knees
Ask for guidance while on the offense
The dead presidents
The obligations to my soul
Leavin to stratigics
Its all mind control
Self discipline
With ambition be my conditionin
Never missin
Demolition 
For all opposition
And that's straight up
Because this ain't no joke
You gots to be fitnredi
We ain't gentle folks
We be renegades
proceed to engage and rock
Never failed a class class
Sound like we's down wit Pac
Shit still on lock
And figure four got the stock
Plus we the foundation for these dreaded juggernauts
Who got world domination on the mind
Done to our design
East 33rd's the first place that i'll be in my shrine
Steady train
Keep fit and maintain
Master Red-1 renegade
True to this game

Chorus

Its just one a them thangs
You know
don't take it personal
And if you do 
When ya coming
Bring ya arsenal
Because
Who don't take heed
Indeed will feel
You need conditionin
Go get the lyrics of steel
And take a listenin
You see you nothin but a tourist
In the land of the fittest
You just a low life forest
Hip Hop stranger
Now ain't nothin that can save ya
Cause ya buck up in a Red
Now ya in a danger

Yea
Same goes for Misfit
Rockin ya will like a manger
So baby listen
And then
I am the player
Who is most valuable
Reckin with the flows that's infalable
It be
The lyrical contortionist
Misfit along side Red-1
Get it heated real quick
So don't forget
Cause jack be nimble

With the war cry, me amigos at my side
Ready to take the world on, do or die
As the fly down low, lyrical Van Gogh
Stay international with the ill I-D-O
Money making flows, pesos from Mexico
To European ends and yens from Tokyo
Amend for the years that we rocked skid row
In a trash bungalow, trying to juggle our flow
But you know how the struggle go, life move slow
Yo, plus it's extra hard when you got no dough
But we strive on, mentality stay strong
Dropping bombs on the world from North West Saigon
Deep in the Babylon, def gone won watch them run
The heart is wicked and judgment soon come

Can finish 'em off, at any cost
No rules, just according to laws
Yo, came to win, ain't looking for friends
Just to do what we gotta to be champions
Like stompin' again and again, to defeat
Cause to know victory you gotta know defeat
It's survival of the fittest and we playin' for keeps
Deep in beef, the word on the streets is war
And it's my duty to keep it raw and lay the law
And if they act up, throw 'em in the figure four
Yo, we met with Hart, they tried to play the part
Of the big dogs who don't bark, hear the roar

You're only save outside the ropes
You lost hope, tellin' me you can't cope
Ain't got the skills, so sound the bell, the bout is finished
Hittin' missiles, you can't beat the best, get out the busines
You couldn't pin a cushion with a needle
Your attempts is feeble
I lock a submission make you tap fast in front of these people
In record time, climb the ropes, stand up drop kick
To add insult to injury, make sure you feelin' me
See we, come to entertain and wreck shop
And send a message to you suckers as we stand on top
Don't bite what you can't chew, don't challenge what you can't do
Cause when it comes down to heart, I got the power of two
Pumpin' adrenaline, shit kicker, known veteran
Stompin' my comp', at any grudge match, I'll make 'em try again
That's my motto, you better all play in the lotto
'Cause steppin' to my title, boy you end up broke and sorrow
So practisce today, come back years from tomorrow

No arguments, I put it to rest
Step into the ring, you pick up your chest
When it comes time to flex, you ain't got nothing left
No game, no fame, no name, just left a torn mess

Watch your talk, watch who you disrespect

Toastin' this cut, react jazz cats be slappin' glasses
Surrender to the method, yes I've kept it Yard Massive status
Avalanche rap clientele from ambushing
We move quick wit new shit to get the fans pushin'
From out the dynast of the School Yard camp
We start gettin' the microphone just like two large amps
I'm tellin' it, whenever I'm posted with endo to blow
I aim at domes like Double-Oh-Seven, Nintendo 64
James Bond style, secret agent calm bomb threat
Cali merchant, methodist keepin your pom-pom's set
Up in the air like that, this be that black entertainment
And now I got you flashin' back on raps that I came with

""Wit swollen pockets, we gon' take it back home"" [M.A.R.S.]
""Wit swollen pockets, we gon' take it back home"" [M.A.R.S.]
""So step up if you want to keep your rep up""

It be me, Ras the mic grand imperial
Be killin' these MC's that pump wack material
Bullshittin' bout to get their heads splitten, for real
When I'm rollin' ten steps head to field
I the super dope master quotes
Hit y'all in throat, be lyrics of wide scope
Go tell your friends, demand the vote
These niggas playahatin', can't make Ras to go
Now, we show em how we elevate
From the gate, Asia plus the Ras, we frustrate
Fantasize, we bringin' it live, check the size
Of brothers enterprise, we breakin' out the sides
Eyes scan the room, but this two man platoon
All set to meet em at high noon
Does set the blaze, lethal like the sun rays
Six days a week to Sunday's now

From out the dynast of the Massive ranks the Yard mad sarge
Eight bars of ever-ready for you wannabe stars
Lettin' niggas know my purpose when it comes to the vibe
Victoriously crushin' careers that's three times my size
Ceremonial Master, wit the Soul Father Ras
Causin' colonial disaster, lettin' history pass
Through the trash era, stages of the game gotta change
So Father Rasco, let these niggas know what's on your brain

We smash ya'll, for bringin' that small off the wall
Idle chit-chat, we peelin' yo' wig back
Feel that, you got rhymes nigga, where your deal at?
Killin' folks, then where's your steel at?
Perpetratin', like you the man, only got five fans
Test me and get smacked with five hands
Obey all commands, I execute the plans
While y'all still thinkin' of ways to stack grands
Five hundred thou, no sweat of the brow
The shit they did then, I'm doin it right now
BLOAW, bustin' these shots off the top
The runaway train expressin' it non-stop
Niggas ride coach, slow down for the approach
And bring a long toast for gettin' yo' eggs poached
Even off the tone, top notch off the dome
It's me and Planet As, we takin' it back home

Verse 1: 
Yo I be ready to plug all of these thug type scrubs 
While y'all stack coins I stack nothin but dubs 
While you be at the club tryin to step to hoes 
I'll be around the globe tryin to rock the shows 
However it goes I still maintain the spot 
But battlin Ras you gettin blown off the lot 
So wether or not y'all believe 
I still roll up the sleeves 
Then watch niggas fall like leaves 
Breakin they breads 
Got 'em headin back to the homerange 
Now they tryin to summace they whole camp 
My lambshade ready to fade 
You better try to make a trade in the traff 
To help your wack staff 
Buried in the bath, my lyrics bubble and boil 
It's Kut Masta Kurt, Ras ready to spoil 
Now watch me uncall and bounce 
You only add to an ounce 
My pounds can cover ten miles of ground 
The most profound you ever seen 
So all that in-between shit 
Don't really mean shit 
The tighter the fit, the tighter it gets 
We cuttin off the air 
Sick of niggas with rhymes and no flair 
But all that fanfair can leave your head swoll 
Ras with the lyrics that's runnin outta control 
There's only one goal I got 
The shit's hot 
And to the contrary we still rock the spot 

Chorus x2: 
Ras: Now how many times I got to drop these rhymes? 
Planet Asia: And how many times you got to really outshine? 
Ras: And how many times you goin cross these lines? 
Planet Asia: Before you find out you dealin with the wrong kind? 

Verse 2: 
Over the top 
The homegrown potent ass crop 
That'll have your head swingin so fast it won't stop 
I take a double shot o' the gat 
So I can get the contact 
Where these niggas findin they rhymes at? 
I'm three times that 
Bigger than y'all thought 
Rasco, the nigga that's harder than asphault 
Be in between the cracks 
Like needles on the wax 
Like Uncle Sam still be findin time to tax 
My 7 point 5 be, live and in the flesh 
With teflon bullets that sendin 'em in the chest 
No need for stress 
All really had enough 
So bring on these niggas that think they bad enough 
To give me, the Cali emcee, a hand full 
At the same time, keepin these stadiumstands full 
Rasco nigga you knows the program 
Feelin on your girl while bumpin a slow jam 

Chorus x2 
Planet Asia: 
Rasco 
9-8 to 2-thou 
The new style 
Knowmsayin? 
y'all better learn somethin 
SoulFather Rasco 
For Man Time Waits Not 
So keep the shit hot 
Yeah, this be the Planet Asia signin out",How Many X's,1999

My new years resolution: persist to end all wack MC confusion
To break MC's in half, there rhymes be like illusion
My conclusion, Lootpack's the group that cause Likwit Fusion
Brothers mic check 1 but can't get with 2's and
I take levels of the treble, embrace the bass
And grab a hold of the steel and come face to face
Silly mortals, coming through portals yabbin' at the lip
Even if their ass was Asian, they still couldn't flip
Some old lyrical, my spiritual rhymes be physical
Kickin' metaphorical, my style's historical
It's better for a cool brother to say he saw me in an article
I hear wack rumors, but yo, it's hard to cool Wild Child down
I don't clown, I just come forth kicking that Lootpack sound
I give props with my Likwit Crew MC's I rock with
I unlock styles like locksmith

Chorus:

Never am I weededed
""I don't have to smoke...""
Yeah, weededed
Every time you say a freestyle, you must be weededed
I never needed it
""I don't have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up""

[Wild Child]
First off, Lootpack set it off to wreck ya band
The only smoke you ever see Wild Child get be second hand
I've ignored non-freestylin' MC's, they get me bored
My exhibit shows I'm the rhythmic dyslexic lord
Wild Child, known to most people as Cracker Jack
Your style got no flav like licorice that be black
I'm offending when I start bending men
Coming forth with 100% adrenaline
It's not my fault when I come with hip hop from my heart
I get pissed when wack MC's step up and test my art
Props to CDP Crew's, East/West respect
My style or I'mma get your tape and push eject, 'cause we

Chorus:

Weededed
Yo an MC who gets weededed
Every time you say a freestyle, you must be weededed
I never needed it
""I don't have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up""
Ask yourself when you weededed
Are you an MC who gets weededed?
Only a true MC, unless your ass is weededed
I never needed it

[Madlib]
""Hello"" Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo Mr. Herb
""Yes that's my name son, what's the word?""
Come through to my studio so you can enhance my verb
""All right"" Chill with me, lounge with me, make rhymes tight
""Now you've been rapping for a week?""
Yes yes, I'm overnight ""Uh huh""
This is a mind state most wack MC's be in
Thinking they can smoke a blunt once and become an MC
The way I see things you'll see things clearly
Making quotes like Lootpack rocks yearly
Mr. Herb, ""Yes"", I need your opinion my mind's a blur
""Hey yo, smoke with me and I'll make your rhyme's slur""
How's that? ""I'll call my homeboy, his nickname's Sherm""
""He'll fill you in, before you know your memory's short term""
""And you'll be like"", I can crunch any MC's
And I have the illest case of munchies so please keep, ""right""
Doing what you're doin, enhancin' my vocalision
The only time I see you is with infrared vision
Bacause I'm...

Chorus:

Weededed
Are you an MC who gets weededed?
Every time you say a freestyle, you must be weededed
I never needed it
""I don't have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up""
Ask yourself one time when you weededed
All you wack MC's who get weededed
Every time you say a freestyle, you be weededed
I never needed it
""I don't have to smoke a blunt to get pepped up""",Weededed,2014

If there be pain
All you have to do is call on me
If there be pain (hmm hmmm)
All you have to do is call on me
To be with you (to be with you)
And before you hang up the phone
You will no longer be alone
Together we can never fall
Because our love will conquer all

If there be pain
Reach out for a helping hand

Rasel,"A veces voy a veces vengo,
Cuando te miro se me para el tiempo,
Buscando siempre la manera,
Pero nunca me sale y es que me quema,
Esto que llevo dentro
Y es que me pone tierno
Y no lo puedo controlar.
Ay ay ay ah

Diselo Baute!

Y es que mi vicio eres tu y no lo puedo cambiar,
Es que he ido a psiquiatra psicólogo y demás,
Todos coinciden en lo mismo estoy fatal,
Y es que mi cura tu la tiene bien guarda.
Estoy pensando asegurar mi corazón
Por si se para cuando me diga que no,
Es que tan solo con mirarte caminar,
Es como un chute de algo que no se me va.

Y créeme que lo intento,
Pero tu cuando te pones con tu pelo suelto,
La testosterona sube por todo mi cuerpo,
Imposible de parar
Como una fuerte racha de viento.

Y me pone, esto que llevo dentro
Y es que me pone tierno
Y no lo puedo controlar
Ay ay ay ay ah

Por eso te quiero yo te decir a ti bombón,
Que no te voy a dejar ir,
Que yo para ti seria como la luz de sol,
Me pongo y vuelvo a salir,
Así que coge la maleta que nos vamos a ir de aquí

Y si hace falta yo te pongo un piso en Triana,
Con vistas al rio Guadalquivir, mira solo para ti.
Yo me gasto mis ahorros y te llevo a pasear,
Tu serias mi princesa, yo el ladrón de Alibaba.

Ahí va con carita de princesa,
No te dejes embaucar si te coge ya no te suelta,
Te absorbe como si fueras un flan,
Te mete en sitios caros
Que tu nunca podrás pagarás las deudas,
De colgantes y de fiestas,
Le gusta el Glamour y que siempre pagues tu.

Y ahora estoy aquí todo tirado,
Sin ganas de nada y sin un pavo,
Y es que esta tía a mi no me ha dejado,
Ni la cartila pa sellar el paro.

A veces voy a veces vengo,
Cuando la miro se me para el tiempo,
Buscando siempre la manera,
Pero nunca me sale y es que me quema,
Esto que llevo dentro
Y es que me pone tierno
Y no lo puedo controlar.
Ay ay ay ah
