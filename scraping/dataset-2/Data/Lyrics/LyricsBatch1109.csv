The Del McCoury Band,"Sweetheart last night I dreamed of you
You loved me like you used to do
Mornin' come and I woke up and found
I still carry you around

I still carry you around
Everywhere I travel now
No matter how I try to put you down
I still carry you around

I still just can't believe you're gone
Your memory haunts me from now on
I walk the streets of this old lonely town
I still carry you around

I still carry you around
Everywhere I travel now
No matter how I try to put you down
I still carry you around

You're with me everywhere I go
In my heart and in my soul
Down every road, no matter where I'm bound
I still carry you around

I still carry you around
Everywhere I travel now
No matter how I try to put you down
I still carry you around",I Still Carry You Around,1997
The Del McCoury Band,"The first time I saw Carrie Brown 
She was so young and fair 
A voice like spring rain fallin' down and sunlight in her hair 
I'd never seen her face before so I asked all around 
Her daddy owns a grocery store and she lives in Bristol town 

Carrie darlin' Carrie Carrie Brown I cry 
If I can't marry Carrie Brown, believe I'd rather die 

I laid my last ten dollars down 
Though I didn't need a thing 
Just to touch sweet Carrie Brown 

When she handed me my change 
I hung around 'til closin' time I scarce believed my eyes 
My darlin' walkin' arm in arm 
With a boy named Billy Wise 

I walked around in Bristol town a bitter broken man 
A heart that pined for Carrie Brown and a pistol in my hand 
We met again on State Street poor Billy Wise and me 
I shot him in Virginia and he died in Tennessee 

Now I'm down in the Bristol jail and all I do is cry 
Cause the jury found me guilty and the judge says I must die 
I'm just a poor young mountain boy 
Ain't never been to town 
And I've come to ruination for the love of Carrie Brown",Carrie Brown,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"I am Kilrain and I'm a fightin' man
And I come from County Clare
And the brits would hang me for a fenian 
So I took me leave of there

And I crossed the ocean in the ""Arrianne""
The vilest tub afloat
And the captain's brother was a railroad man and he met us at the boat
So I joined up with the 20th Maine
Like I said my friend I'm a fighting man
And we're marchin' south in the pouring rain
And we're all goin' down to dixieland

I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And we fight for Chamberlain
'Cause he stood right with us 
When the johnnies came like a banshee on the wind
When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg many a mother wept
For many a good boy died there, sure
And the air smelted just like death

[Chorus]
I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine 
And I'd march to hell and back again
For colonel Joshua Chamberlain
We're all goin' down to dixieland

I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And I damn all gentlemen
Whose only worth is their father's name
And the sweat of a workin' man
Well we come from the farms 
And the city streets and a hundred foreign lands
And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat
Now we're all Americans

[Chorus]",Dixieland,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"I work the graveyard shift - stay up all night long 
You'll wake up someday 
And find your good gal gone 
If you don't treat your baby right 
She'll come see me 
Some lonely night 

When the sun goes down 
And the moon is gone 
That's when I come around 
Don't you think I won't 
 
On the graveyard shift, stay up all night long 
You'll wake up someday 
And your good gal gone 

I drive a Cadillac, rides just like a dream 
All the pretty gals 
Want to ride with me 
'Cause I got what all the women want 
I never say I do 
When I really don't",The Graveyard Shift,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"I'm a Harlan Man 
Went down in the mine when I was barely grown 
It was easy then 
Cause I didn't know what I know now 

But I'm a family man 
And it's the only life that I've ever known 
But I'm a Harlan Man 
Just as long as my luck and lungs hold out 

I'm a mountain man 
Born in east Kentucky and here I'll stay 
And if it's the good Lord's plan 
I'll wake up in the mornin' and find 

I'm lookin' at the end 
Of another long week and I can draw my pay 
Cause I'm a Harlan Man 
Never catch me whinin' cause I ain't that kind 
 
I'm a union man 
Just like my daddy and all my kin 
I took a union stand 
No matter what the company said 

I got me two good hands 
And just as long as I'm able I won't give in 
Cause I'm a Harlan Man 
A coal minin' mother til the day I'm dead",Harlan Man,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"I didn't know 
You'd be in this place tonight 
Then again I thought you might 
Now I don't know what to do 
Does it show 
When my poor heart skips a beat 
Each and every time we meet 
'Cause I'm still in love with you 

There you are 
Right across the room from me 
Just the way I knew you'd be 
Lookin' lonesome wild and blue 
I'm alright so far 
Just as long as you don't speak 
That's what makes my knees go weak 
'Cause I'm still in love with you 

I've done everything I know 
To get you off my mind 
But sometimes I can't help but hope 
That you won't walk away this time 

Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
Wouldn't have to miss you so 
'Cause I'm still in love with you 

If I knew what I know now 
I'd never let you leave 
I'd make it up to you somehow 
And darlin' you'd come back to me 

Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
Wouldn't have to miss you so 
'Cause I'm still in love with you 
I wouldn't need to be so blue 
Wouldn't want you like I do 
'Cause I'm still in love with you",I'm Still in Love With You,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"Leroy was a farmer and an honest man 
Would have lived in Oklahoma all his days 
He just wanted left alone to work a piece of land 
But a hard wind come and blew his dreams away 
So he headed for the West Coast thought he could not lose 
Rollin' down the highway with the dust bowl blues 

It's a thousand miles from Broken Bow to Bakersfield 
And the highway's paved with heartaches all the way 
Leroy drove on lookin' for a better deal 
A place a man could settle down and stay 
But the police at the state line beat him black and blue 
Left him lyin' by the roadside with the dust bowl blues 

They say California is a paradise 
Hollywood turns night time into day 
But up along the San Joaquin those city lights 
Might as well be a million miles away 
When your kids are cold and hungry wearin' worn out shoes 
Standin' in the garden with the dust bowl blues",Leroy's Dustbowl Blues,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 
I can't go home cause I can't face another day alone 
Now that you're gone this ain't no place for me 
I want to start all over new 
But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly 
Just want to go to someplace you won't be 
I'm movin' on to a new place and hold my head up high 
Where no one knows what you done to me 
A thousand miles between us now 
And still some how 
These blues'll track me down 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

I'm bound down that long lonesome highway cause it's the only place I know 
Where there ain't no clouds hangin' over me 
Leave me alone cause it's a long way no matter where I go 
Nothin' but blues as far as I can see 
I wish I had you back again 
But I know I can't 
So here I go again 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory","Long, Lonesome Highway Blues",1999
The Del McCoury Band,"I was born on this mountain a long time ago
Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night

I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But i'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home

I was young on this mountain but now i am old
And i knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
'til one night i lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and i went down in the mine

There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And god only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed",The Mountain,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"Come on pretty baby won't you take me by the hand 
I thought maybe that I could be your man 
And for a while (unknown) we could go in style 
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon 

I gotta keep movin', 'cause baby I'm a travelin' man 
And there ain't a lot of women out there that understand 
But if you do (unknown) I'll be good to you 
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon 

Goin' up the country honey, don't you want to go? 
Gotta little money, all you gotta do is let me know 
I know a place we could disappear without a trace 
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon",Outlaw's Honeymoon,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys 
This ain't never been my home 
Sometimes the road was rocky long the way, boys 
But I was never travelin' alone 

We'll meet again on some bright highway 
Songs to sing and tales to tell 
But I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys 
Until I see you fare thee well 

Ain't no need to cry for me, boys 
Somewhere down the road you'll understand 
Cause I expect to touch his hand, boys 
Put a word in for you if I can",Pilgrim,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"My Grandaddy was a railroad man 
When I was young he took me by the hand 
Dragged me to the station at the break of dawn 
Said ""boy I got to show you somethin' 'fore it's gone"" 
She was blue and silver, she was right on time 
We rode that Texas Eagle on the Mopac line 

We had some sandwiches that Granma packed 
We rode to Palestine and hitchhiked back 
Home in time for supper with a tale to tell 
That night I dreamed I heard that lonesome whistle wail 

When I got old enough to take the train alone 
I rode that Texas Eagle down to San Antone 

Nowadays they don't make no trains 
Just the piggyback freighters and them Amtrak things 
They shut the Eagle down awhile ago 
Sold it to the railroad down in Mexico 
But every now and then that whistle's on my mind 
I ride that Texas Eagle cross the borderline",Texas Eagle,1999
The Del McCoury Band,"Since you left me baby I've been true to you
I don't run around with every gal in town
The way I used to do
I'm startin' over new
Your's forever blue

I wrote you a letter and every word was true
I apologized for all my lies
And the way I treated you
Signed it ""lonely fool""
Your's forever blue

Lately I've been hurtin' deep inside of me
My poor heart's broke and every ragged stroke
Brings back your memory
Keeps me wantin' you
Yours forever blue

But I don't need no doctor to tell me what to do
'Bout this spell of yours 'cause there ain't no cure
Even if I wanted to
Can't get over you

If you ever want me you know what to do
Just call my name 'cause I ain't ashamed
To crawl on home to you
If you want me to
Your's forever blue

The only song I know play it soft and low
While I moan the blues for you

The Del McCoury Band,"Everytime I hear that whistle whine
From a lonesome locomotive comin' down the line
It carries my mind away to another place in time
When train travelin' across the land was the only way to fly

Am I a fool to think it glamorous
Box-carrin' like a hobo, it must have been rough
But a simpler way of life is what it really means to me
When we weren't so dependent on money to bee free

I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'

I'm lyin' on a rotten wooden floor
Smell yesterday's whiskey here rattlin' at the door
Railroad man lookin' for me I'm scared as I can be
I open my eyes and realize its just another dream

I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'

There you go again train travelin'",Train Travelin',2003

I'll dry my tears and move on 

If you don't want me

I'll dry my tears and move on

You treated me just good enough until now

But if you're tired of me

I'll get over you somehow

Oh, if you don't want me

I'll dry my tears and move on

 

If you don't need me

There's someone else

Who need me out there

She's kind and tender and

One day I'll find her I swear

So set me free

While I've still got time

Faded love

As if you need a reason

Am i out of your dreams

Oh you wouldn't understand 

You hide it in your heart

You don't hold it in your hand

The Del McCoury Band,"With a throw and a roll

It could take control

And gamble us away

We're sliding in the groove

And I expect that's 

Where we'll stay

 

Chorus:

I'm telling you 

It's not a game

Play with the fire

And you'll live with the flame

Hey now, there's nothing new

I'm damned if I don't

And I'm damned if I do

 

There's a road that you take

And there's the one 

You leave alone

There's a view of the highway

In my happy home

I said that I love you

While I said goodbye

You can part and remember 

With a smile or a sigh

 

Chorus

 

Hard to be leavin' 

Impossible to stay

The road that we took

Revealed the one

And pray forever more

But when you fly from the cage

Don't forget to lock the door

The Del McCoury Band,"Well, the seasons come and the seasons go
And the reason you left is I'll never know
There will be others, yes, I know it's true
But they won't do like I did for you

My love will not change
My love will not change
It just rolls like a river to the sea of your name

My love will not change
My love will not change
It's as steady as the rhythm of the pouring rain

Strong as the wind 'cross the mountaintop

The Del McCoury Band,"Did you ever meet somebody that likes all the same things you do?
Somebody who can make you or break you anytime they want to
I met her at a red light, love at first sight, can this be true?
She's good for me and she told me I was good for her too

Now, I don't want to jump into anything
I've been tryin' to use some self restraint
But man it's amazin'
She's the same kind of crazy as me

Wild, wild nights, chasin' each other through the moonlight
My, my, my, I finally got somethin' right

'Cause every little off-beat move she makes
Suits me to a tee
You know what I'm sayin'
She's the same kind of crazy as me

It's gettin' hard to use a ladder 'cause I keep climbin' down just to kiss her
'Cause she's out of my sight for a minute or two, I start to miss her
We stay all tangled up in each other's arms and it's so nice
She talks in her sleep but she always gets my name right

If there's anything at all that's wrong with her
It's somethin' that I can't see
Ain't no doubt about it
She's the same kind of crazy as me

Wild, wild nights, chasin' each other through the moonlight
My, my, my, I finally got somethin' right

'Cause every little off-beat move she makes
Suits me to a tee
You know what I'm sayin'
She's the same kind of crazy as me

You know what I'm sayin'
She's the same kind of crazy as me

",Same Kind of Crazy,2003
The Del McCoury Band,"I'm wanting someone that's loved and lost
Someone that's known the thrill and paid the cost
Someone that says they'll never take a chance
Of another broken heart by false romance



    Wanted an unwanted love
    To share all the misery and pain
    Of a heart that's unwanted in love
    And unwilling to gamble again



I don't want to love again I'm sure
Someone who's love is not sincere
I don't want someone that hasn't known
How it feels to love and then be left alone



  * Refrain



I know there are others like me
Alone, foot loose and fancy free
Yet chained to a love they'll never claim
And afraid to ever love again

The Del McCoury Band,"As I looked at the valleys down below 
                       
 They were green just as far as I could see. 
                
 As my memory returned, oh how my heart did yearn 
   
 for you and the day that used to be. 


 (Chorus) 

 High on a mountain oh, wind blowin' free 

 Thinking about the days that used to be. 
      
 High on a mountain oh, standin' all alone 

 Wondering where the years of my life has flown. 


 Oh I wonder if you ever think of me 
 or if time has blotted out your memory. 
 As I listen to the breeze, whisper gently through the trees 
 I'll always cherish what you meant to me. 

",High on a Mountain,2004
The Del McCoury Band,"Oh, I woke up this morning
A long before the dawn
I stumbled to the kitchen
And put some coffee on

The house was deathly quiet
I knew something was wrong
Then suddenly it dawned on me
The cold gray light of gone

No, there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone
When waking up and findin' out
She's never comin' home

And the note that said it's over
Lord, it chills me to the bone
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone

Oh, I sat and cried for hours
And I tried to clear my head
I even went and laid back down
On her side of the bed

Her perfume lingered on the sheets
Our love once laid upon
Her memory's destroying me
In the cold gray light of gone

No, there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone
When waking up and findin' out
She's never comin' home

And the note that said it's over
Lord, it chills me to the bone
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone

No, there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone
When waking up and findin' out

The Del McCoury Band,"Give me the highway
Lord knows I love to roam
Give me the highway
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan

White lines, neon signs
Have always been my home
Give me the highway
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone

Down every road I travel
Lord, to you might look the same
But maybe you might tell me
Every town's got a different name

I'd like to find a woman
That won't hell-bent to tie me down
Someone to be content
To go anywhere I'm bound

The Del McCoury Band,"My new neighbor from the city
Bought forty acres up the road
He made his money in the market
Now he's wearing cowboy clothes
He's got no cows or chickens
But the hat and boots look cool
When he parties on the weekend
Forty acres and a fool

He says he's getting in to ranching
He's got a pretty trophy wife
Set her up in a Mcmansion
But now he's trying to wreck my life
He drives around in his new Hummer
I tell my kids ""don't walk to school""
Took out my mailbox, squashed a possum
Forty acres and a fool

He don't need to borrow nuthin'
'Cause he's got one of every tool
Installed a laptop on his Bobcat
Then drove it right into the pool
I never see his hands get dirty
And I'm not jealous as a rule
Can't get used to living next to
Forty acres and a fool

He goes to Cancun in the winter
I get relief for a week or two
Then he's back here with a vengeance
Sometimes life can be so cruel
The county officials are his buddies
He uses money like a tool
He wines and dines them on the weekends
What's this country coming to?

The Del McCoury Band,"When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me the Valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine

If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

You'll be older too
And if you say the word I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride

Doing a garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams

I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

The first time we met I was sure she was steaming
This is my life, this is my life
What a life 
Life isn't precious and life isn't sacred
Sometimes release only comes when you meet death
A night of reprieve we were wrecked when we slept in the park
When we woke in the morning you cried could I squeeze out the dark

Destroy the noises that make all the voices 
Get them out of my head
Bring on the screaming and I'll take your demons now that I'm all already dead

Days of release when she almost felt better 
Gradually faded and words couldn't get her 
Where is the light, where is the light, get the light
Fearless and clear all her doubts had been cast off
Last night alive is a nightmare I'm part of
Dreams are a lie, dreams are a lie
So am I
If that's all there is then I might as well get in the fire

Destroy the noises that make all the voices
Get them out of my head
Bring on the screaming and I'll take your demons now that I'm already dead

And give these hands of mine another chance

Ladies and gentlemen
You know, we're mighty
Glad to be here today

And although we're
The stars of the show
We know that that
Ain't all there is to it

Because behind every star
As behind every great man
There is a woman

And I want to tell you out there
That if you are a man
You've got a woman

And I think you should take
A little time out to salute that woman
And give that woman a
Great big round of applause

There's a lot of plastic faces of every kind
And as you walk around the stage of life
Don't it kind of make you feel proud

You know no matter what the problems
There's one who understands
And you can rest assured, feel secure
She'll make you her only man

Give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you
Oh, give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you

When you can't get no satisfaction
And your world is full of gloom
She gives you strength and confidence
When she walks into the room

From the roar of a thousand voices
Comes a sound you've learned to know
When she calls your name
You can't feel no pain
You gotta smile and a standing O

Give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you
Oh, give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you

Stand up and give a hand
Stand up and give a hand
Stand up and give your lady a standing
Standing ovation, standing ovation

You know no matter what the problems
There's one who understands
And you can rest assured, feel secure
She'll make you her only man

We so foul and profound
Blowouts, CD's sold out, the illest no doubt
When ""Celph Titled"" roll out, immaculate respect

""Uzi's"" and ""Tek's"" protect your neck with a teflon turtleneck
Bitch there ain't a diesel cat that could face me
You don't really want to run your mouth and make me
Summon the gods with my mystery chant

And perform the running-man for my victory dance
Murder motherfuckers mostly over money with guns to they tummies
Hollow-tips that leave you stiffer than a mannequin dummy
Record a demo while the ""Demigodz"" make new songs

Your better off running the triathlon with parachutes on
A real bug-nigga, and that's how I'm better known
You make beats, I'd rather rhyme to a metronome
Other crews got ego's but can't floss right
I'll run them over have em' smoking the exhaust pipe

I'm bigger than that, smile when you kicking my raps
Have conversations with your girl while she sits on my lap
Yo stop talking about they girls man it's starting to get old
Well, um, no tell they girls to stop leaving they clothes

The reason I flow, is not to just get us indoors
Pops in barber shops like my son is better than yours

Pull dimes that start trends, while your trying to make amends

I look like an MC who murders the spot
Like ""Derek Jeter"" looks like a smaller version of ""The Rock""
Bitch please, I never ever met a dick-tease
I'm so cool that when I spit free's my spit freeze

""Old Yeller"", I'm known to leave a fella
With more cuts and scratches than the ""Shook One's"" acapella
You want to fuck around with ""Esoteric""
And blown on some bullshit like working-dice-credit

When rappers try, they usually step and die
Then MC's get the message like a number I don't recognize
Your call her back, pop minds they hear me freestyle
And spend the next seven days hittin' redial

A ""Demigod"" that's beyond your small blundering brains
Fortunate fame, really it's just one in the same
That I obtain while your still a bum begging for change

Trying to front like your new and really nothing has changed
You ain't underground, your locked in a dungeon with chains
Your not a thug 'cause' you rock your little ""Lugz"" and a chain
I'm a slug, nah fuck that, I'm double the pain

Your hussling game is lame, couple bucks and a name
Maybe some buckets of champagne with sluts in the range
I'll fuck with your brain and flex so your muscles are strained
Until your nothing but a punk clutching crutches and canes

Now she walks by me like she never met me

I wonder now what I was thinking of
I was so in love I let her hurt me though I knew better
Under the influence of love

Why did I let her do me like she done me?
Why can't I get that woman off my mind?
Although I know she never truly loved me
I wish she break my heart just one more time

With all the things we?ve talked of doing

When you smile 
I realize little imperfections I want to memorize
Don?t hide
Would you like it if I??
Would you like to kiss?
Well maybe I might
You look really pretty in the light
And if you let me I?ll feed my appetite

Seeking comfort in this painful retreat

See the rose that appears so real
Just like the one you saw in your dreams

They just feed their flames with miracles

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or white-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin ""Aiy papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they roll propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with g ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

I got that good dick girl, ya didn't know
Oh Biggie gimme one more chance

Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
and if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Rourke?
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit

The Detroit Spinners,"She's got a smile a million miles long
I got a trail of crying and leaving songs
You don't know, and you don't care
You're completely unaware
Sometimes I wanna rip out your heart
To see if something's there

(chorus)

Cold hearted woman, you're bringing me down in flames
Runnin' 'round all over town, runnin' down my name
Gonna get me a loaded pistol, hey, was that out loud
Cold hearted woman, I'm gonna put you in the ground

When the money comes rollin', I can do no wrong
When that river stops flowin', she's burning up the telephone
By the time that I find you, my money's all down the drain
You burn it up on cheap motels and eight balls of cocaine

The Detroit Spinners,"One of a kind love affair is
The kind of love that you read about in a fairy tale

But love stays around
And when you know you're right, but you got to make a little sacrifice
You make it for love

I never thought about today would come
When she would leave without good-bye, yes, sir.
She wrote a line or two upon the wall 
Said, I'm leaving you, know I love you too
I can't stay with you 
And this very day, I could never say a discouraging word
'Cause I love you 
Who-oh-oh-oh, yes, siree, now
(One of a kind) love affair is

There won't be a fight, 'cause your love is right
But you're leaving wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
(One of a kind) ooh (love affair is) Ooh yeah

So I lose myself
In someone else's charms
I can't hold them to my heart
And take you back again

Is that what you want...?",Everytime You Go,1993
The Devlins,"I see you're angry with the things you did
And I know you will be lost until
You find a reason that can make you see my wish

And now I'm watching as you swing your dress
And your friends may cool your own distress
But you could change it all with
Just one kiss, one kiss

CHORUS
'Cause I don't want to be like this...for too long

And the words are racing through my head
But they need to come from you instead
So close your eyes and think of all the things you miss

The Devlins,"They said the world was a different place
Through the eyes of another face
They said the change would be slow in coming round

They said the sky would be burning bright
And all the angels would begin to fight
Over the reason why there's no seasons
And there'll be no day and night

...But I knew that

I heard the words you were telling me
I heard your lies, your stupidity
But all these things you say to me
You just don't understand

...You see I knew that

And if you look maybe you might find
The words came from another mind
And if you think that you've got it right
Well maybe you should stand and fight

They tried to talk but it was no good
They said you'd leave and I knew you would
I knew the time and I knew the place
But through the eyes of another face

I saw the words that were in your head
I heard the thoughts that remained unsaid
I tried to talk but it's much too late
'Cause I seem mixed up and I can't relate

...But I knew that!

What do you say when love is gone
...I said I knew that",I Knew That,1993
The Devlins,"I feel like I've been lost somewhere
And I find out why I'm here again
And time stretches across my mind
Spins all the way around

And now I find myself alone
My head without a home
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

CHORUS
And where will you be
When all this is coming down?
With time to kill
Where will you be
When all this is coming down?
You're a necessary evil

You lit a fire with the sweetest kiss
I saw the flame and I held my hand to it
And I know that if I ever miss you'll
Burn me to the ground

And now I'm lost within myself
I'm losing self respect
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

CHORUS

You've changed me now
I search for something new
And I hurt myself but I can't see it through

Now I find myself alone
My head without a home
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

CHORUS",Necessary Evil,1993
The Devlins,"Every time I look at you
I think of all the things we could do
And all the happiness you could use

Fancy cars and limousines
Take you every where to be seen
But do you really need these things to get by

'Cause if you're looking kind of sad about it
Tell me, what you need?

CHORUS
Anything that you want done baby
Anything at all
Any tie you need me
I'll return your call, yes I will
Turn you around

If love is all that you're searching for
You know I've got so much more
Than you will ever need

Could run into your mind
ANd say the things that I can't say

And all of this time
I'm thinking to myself
The only thing I see is you
My life runs through
Your heart will be a place for me

Night speeds so fast
It's easy now
I cut myself on these thoughts of you
And I hear your voice
I'm running now into your world
That takes me near the edge of real
My mind to steal each night with you
Make everything seem new

CHORUS
And it feels like I'm
Spending all my time
Chasing dreams I wish so would come true
If you hold the knife
I would take my life
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
Until the light shines through

Nothing changes now my heart stands still
You could part my will to live

CHORUS",Until The Light Shines Through,1993
The Devlins,"I watch your eyes, across the room
And I see how much they've changed
From what I knew
Things seem so different now
In your life
But I never wanted more that you could find

And the sun won't shine, into your room
And the love you thought you felt
Was never true
Things seem so different now
In my life
And you know I felt the emptiness of time

It took me so long...

You say the world is wide
And your thoughts are deep
And the wind will carry

You may find yourself
Lost alone and bleeding

Yeah, I'm gonna remember you

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question

Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do

I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question

Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play?
Show up on my doorstep
With a bouquet
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say, baby, I love you
Like you used to?

I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah)
I think about it everyday (everyday)
And even though we've moved on (moved on, uh huh)

Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (Walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me, my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose the love that was meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her, and wish that it was you that I'm kissin'
Sometimes I miss him, and wish that it was you that I'm missin'
Sometimes I hug her, and wish that it was you that I'm huggin'
And I realized how much I'm buggin'
I miss you

So how do I express this feeling?
'Cause nobody compares to you
And you know that she'll never love you like I do

An airline ticket to romantic places

Spoken then he took off like the devil and there was fire in his eyes

Said I'll go a thousand miles before the sun can rise. but he hit a

The Dickies,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1989

The Dickies,"Hello darkness, my old friend 
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
A'neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared, no one dared disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""you do not know, silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you, take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence""",Sounds of Silence,1999

But then I was young
I used to shiver in the wings
Till I found my own tongue

And I didn't pay my dues
Yeah, I knocked 'em dead in Dallas
They didn't know we were Jews

I sock 'em everywhere that I sing

I don't wanna be a bore
I just wanna live a rich life
And I wanna die poor

The Dictators,"Who's that boy with the sandwich in his hand?
You won't miss me, even though you can
He could make a dead dog laugh
And watch me kick my mother on her ass
He's no boy and yet he ain't no man.

He don't know what he's gonna do
In three years, I'm gonna be twenty-two-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo
All his friends think he's great
I'm their favorite degenerate
You might say he's just too crazy for you

BRIDGE
I'm the most outrageous
Hope it's not contagious
All the world's got a one-way ticket to heck, to heck, to heck

You can bet that he's no Mickey Mouse
Give me an hour, and I'll destroy your house
Eatin' eggs (?) all day long
Sleepin' with the TV on
He looks just like you, turn him inside out (x 3).

The memories they burn

Then I start a fight because I'm only half the man I was with you
Said we'd never part until we die

And a forty-gallon still

The other watched the spout
And mama corked the bottles
And ole Dooley fetched 'em out.

Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley give me a swaller
And I'll pay you back someday.

The revenuers came for him
A-sippin' though the woods
Dooley kept behind them all
And never lost his goods

Dooley was a trader
When into town he'd come
Sugar by the bushel
And molasses by the ton.

And I'l pay you back someday.

The day ole Dooley died
The women folk weren't sorry
And the men stood round and cried

Now Dooleys on the mountain
He lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him
And a barrel for his stone.

   And why did I leave the plow in the field

The Dimensions,"I'm gonna tell you a story 
'Bout ol' Mary Lou 
I mean the kind of a girl 
That make a fool of you 
  
She make a young man old 
And an old man pay 
The way she took my money 
Was a crying shame 
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar 
  
Put a detective 
On her trail 
The post office thought 
They'd chase her by the mail 
  
She got picked up 
And then was put in jail 
Stroked the judge 
Just to go her bail 
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar 
  
She left Detroit 
To go to Kalamazoo 
Made her a fortune 
Out of fools like you 
  
Met her a rich man 
Who was married and had some kids 
Stroked that cat 
Until he flipped his lid 
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar 
  
She came back into town 
About a week ago 
Told me she's sorry 
She had hurt me so 
  
I had a '65 Ford 
And a two dollar bill 
The way she took that 
Lord, it gave me a thrill

But I've never felt no chains sitting up on the fence

So sick of shruggin' and smilin' about the way it is

Linking up with Cam and linking up with the Roc now

Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
Shit, we live life to the fullest
Three hundred and sixty five nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Shit, and uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, but the morning's much colder
I've seen summers get cold
And niggaz do it up until the point they done and the fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten, up north sitting, just like some fucking lost kittens
They get locked up for carrying boy
Doing time underground up in Marion, boy
Shit, I respect you
You do your time like Gotti, and come home like that Marion boy

You caught a bid? Do it, You got kids? Love 'em, hug 'em

I gotta keep striving, I gotta keep moving, I gotta keep grinding
If this was the road, and I was a trucker, then shit man, I gotta keep driving
Through the lies and deception, had to ride through neglection
I'm an insomniac, up all night, pops and moms was an addict, shit
My puffing scums is a habit
I need me a contingency plan, my pops with the syringe in his hand
He was leaning and nodding
Uncle Ricky your mission is like Afeni was Robin
Shit, you should've seen the apartment
All I ever wanted was franks and beans I was starving
Crack fiends on the carpet, shit
But if it wasn't for grandma
I swear I'm in love with my grandma
That's why I only does it for grandma
That's when I roll in the street
I pray she covers me from the crown of my head, to the sole of my feet

Two tires, two pliers, a wrench and a few wires, shit

Need a rehab I'll call up Shania
Bitch hungry, good, we gonna stall in papaya
Take your recession special, yeah you less then special
Me and Jim Jones, extra special
Check it, Dre to Snoop, Gotti to Ja
Dame to Jigga, Puff to Big, D n' why
Doggy you next up, get your respect up
Or a vest can't protect you when I hit you in your chest, duck
The big heads done pushed me
You gotta be sex: dickheads is pussy, killa
I bring the hammers to the gunfight
One night stand, only standing for one night

No homo, I will jump in that ass, jump and I flash
Then jump in that jag, jumpsuit
Jump back from the coroner, I have you jump in that bag
Come with that cash

Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm ""Gon' Til' November""
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggaz, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please)
I see a town I'm likin'
See some niggas getting money in a town I like it
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like it's my block now, all right kid?
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out, ranged out the side of his right ear
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that pyrex vision
Pop, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitchin'
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm livin
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!

Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive in the city where the skinny niggas die?
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way

Birds flip a dozen, chicks is dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, toys kissing muppets
Worst then that, they go home and kiss they husband
That shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons buggin'

Now days he work for F-E-D-S
And plays his recorder

She understands my life gets rowdy
I'm the same say
Prane day I'm icy outey

Yo, now I done been on both sides of the fence
Now I done been on both sides of the gate 
Survived and escaped
Look at me now man I'm driving away
Thinking about my old teacher who said I rot and decay
(Never)
I go back and beep the horn at them
Blowing that cheech and chong at them
Yelling, screaming the boy is platinum

It all happens so fast
They all imagine I crash
But I did straight through I'm bad
Like Michael was see what the cycle does
360 spin around, I'm the new kid in town

Yeah it's coming soldier, 
April the month it's over
Yeah your run is over
The album is done I told you
What a classic I made, I look up see Cam
See the game what a path that he made
A beautiful mind trapped in the shade
Cracking codes for the man
Who only stand in the back of my brain
At last I done came up in the proper way
True author like the great doctor J was

You can't respect the amount jewels in this new wide movement
If you don't respect the amount of dudes in this too live movement
Me and Killa, we like them,
Those two guys moving I-95 south dirty
With them two pies moving, moving
Trying to crease out the lightning
Trying to keep out the excitement
But it's hard in this bulls***, in this game
'Cause the secret indictments
And you coke experimenters
And you coke experiencers

Be easy on the phone dog,
'Cause you know the hearing us
You styling them b****es
Cause you know they serious
Just picturing, it's so easy to draw
Stop and freeze at them whores
Then we speed off in cars
Then we breezing the law
Blowing that weed from my jaw

G's up hoe's down
East Side to by dog

All the time man
Thanks for even asking
Or we be seen in Aspen
In that pool house, that hot tub with that steam relaxing
And we be seen in action

Keep them fiends collapsing
And they thirsty and they nodding and the be ?
They see me my actions
I cruise by in a Beemer just laughing
I let that rock and roll

I coping poppy's load
It was like coping gold, 
I shut down poppy's load
I hit the strip dog
I see the cops get load

Aiyoo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tuned with
The moon and the stars, some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught, pissy clubs, saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds, run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge: Cam'Ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, aiyyoo
Go get that ya-yo, ya-yo

You see it, you like it, we count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a menace to the public society
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it I'm driving, I'm puffing high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving, I'm bugging my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers for all they milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
Uh, you niggaz follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me, and still a little nigga

Get their check, hair, nails done, steak and chicken, for they friends
And they kids fly, I ain't open friend, on the 11th, you gonna be broke again

Coming to see Cam, for some coke again

Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image, it's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people, why, because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people

Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She'd get cracked up and hit, keep soaping your cycle mami

Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie

For the words that he spoke, that stung like a bee
Soaked into me, you niggaz will see but
I'm still insane, I'm Rodman, dealing my brain
I'm grinding sharing my pain, fuck, where is the fame
Niggaz, they still rhyming, still in the game
They still dealing the cane, still cock shit in your brain, homie
I still smell the rotten people that lay
There in ground zero, forgotten, left in for days
Probably left there to stay, left in decay
Broken pieces of towers, left in their graves
I pray they be saved, until then, that's just a suggestion I made
Follow me homie, listen, I subjected my ways nigga
Weapons that spray, at your fucking face nigga
It's Santana the great, in the place niggaz, stay away nigga
Cause I'm headed straight to the top, niggaz
Diplomat Taliban slash ROC nigga
Oh yeah, I do this for my block niggaz
D train, Al Gator, pop niggaz
Young drugs, young twins, Shiest bug
Niggaz I love, my thugs
Now, come fuck with your boy
Jones, Killa, Freakay, come fuck with your boy, WHOA
It's Santana again nigga, no bandanas just him nigga
In the flesh, like
[Cam'Ron]
I seen it time, business and friendship
Friendships ended, business attended, clips get extended
Lawyers get called, accountants get faxed
That was my man, well I wish that he meant it
It's been a long time, hereing the mobsters
This ain't overnight, it's years in the process
Shed a tear in the process, now process is over
All my niggaz get prepared for the Oscars
Back to the block, sharing a lobster
Morris Malone, Sam Malone, preparing the vodka, holla
Hallejulah, no hum-do-allah, but respecting my Aki
He held me down, when it was getting real rocky
Hustling, isn't a hobby
I sit in the lobby, look at my ovie, have visions of Gotti
Visions of lotties, pictures of Blood, scenes of L
I want to see my son, piss in that potty
Jimmy, I'm going to make sure your wrist is real rocky
See my plans are for long term like Mr. Miyagi
Wax on, wax off, put our wax on, take that wack off
Over some nights, I had fights over the white
The roads to the lows, I knows what it's like
Now, career over like Mike: anyone
Tyson, Jordan, Jackson, it's over
This shit right here touched my soul, man
My grandmother or something, 56 bless her soul

Want to use my brain, than give Killa mad dough
It's all good, increase Killa cash flow
Increase my fame, that's why Killa smash hoes
You'll get side swiped, look at my life
First movie ever, merked out Mekhi Phife

Gave her a son like Ricky, from ?Boyz in the Hood'
On the couch bloody, old lady sighing
Wifey screaming (I really mean it)
Pissy little baby crying

Before this mac that's strapped on me, gets snatched off me
Cocked back used to crash your homies, oh
Why yall can't fuck with me man, I guarantee man
It's Santana the rap +He-man+
Why yall skeltors get your melons torched when this weapon sart letting off
Santana no, don't hurt 'em, don't squirt 'em
Don't let the nine burn 'em in the sternum
They don't want to go to war with ya'
They ain't ready to bang or go to war with ya'
So leave 'em alone, don't feed 'em the chrome
Why yall labels'll to stop watching me

Why yall can't fuck with the ""Great"" Santana, bandanna give in clips and weight
Hammers will split your face, shift your waist, to a different place
Next thing you know, I'm in a different state
Back next month, new whip, different plate
Damn, Santana delivery the raw
Delivery the four, for sure man, I did it before
So if your bitch is a whore, don't fight for her
Don't waste your life for her, trying to make it right for her
With all that frontin' your doin', and stuntin' you're doin'
I'll shoot the bump while you moving and shut you from moving

[Chorus]

[Juelz Santana]
Why yall niggas don't ride like I do
Slide through in that 7-4-5 blue, right beside who? Killer
Where Jones, in the pick-up truck
Yeah we use that to pick up stuff, pick up bucks
And my Denali is often parked, inside of my condo
How much did he sign for?
Oh, I bet you want to know that money
Yeah I bet you I won't show that money
I keep it stashed away, right next to the 4-4, money
Keep a lo-pro money, this is slo-mo money
I'm used to that fast crack, bag crack
Re-cook bag that, give it out, half that
If it still bags, have stacks
No more running back to me, coming back to me
I'm on the corner with a hundred packs of these
Damn, oh, he got the purple

The Diplomats,"Yo, I try to be easy
I try to be calm breathe easy, it don't seem easy
I'm on my Ps and Qs, Ys and Zs, .45 on the side of me
Plus, four guys on the side of me, with .45 on the side of them

We can play now, this is a war not a playground
We came here to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Wills for us any day now, cops with their wall to wall raids down
I'm ducking and weaving, running and leaving

Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plunger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this Nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as fuck, you're fucked if I leave ya chump

Went to school, but ain't stay in class, hated class
Only for period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games was bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at

Hop scotching on niggaz faces kept my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work and yeah, chopping the work up
Keep him on my clock, clocking my work up, niggaz know me

Taught him how to cook, livin' his work up
Told him it's not the pot, it's the worker, gotta mix shorty
Gotta do it like this shorty
Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist shorty
Fuck with me

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing

Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
The sequel of Able, fuck with your boy

You motherfuckers really don't know
You motherfuckers really wont know
I'm real fucka, I really wont fold
I kill fuckas and wheelie off roads

Bangie rapper, like I'm really off road
The pain I feel, I really wont show man
The game is real, I really don't know Cam
If I'ma make it or not

But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
Till the day I'm laid on the block, with shots in me

Stay weeded, stay cheffing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught
In my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me

So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen
Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it

This is the Matrix, I take it we live in
Shit, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'

Shoot shit, shit is poppin'
Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready whoa!

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing

Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table

You may crutch man, yo

We leaves spots milt, you get your top tilt
Mop filled, my block leaves cops killed, duck shots still
You not built, you had zirconia's, those was zirconia's
I kept it spot built, I can ensemble linen
Grinin' on rock, silk, I'm hitting bitches like switches
I'm a top Wilt, that's Chamberlain, mama became a friend
Said she had the lamest men, wanted to learn the game I win
I had to game her then, you rearrange your friends
Then you change that Benz, we need a Range with Rims
She bought a gravy Rover, it had a pastry odor
Yes she made the quota, cause I'm like Ray Liotta
Fiends in a caskets, leaning them bastards
But the meanest of fabrics, when I'm with Athena Onassis
Or Ms. Trina, the queen of the asses
Causes when it come to purple, I've seen it in masses

Whoo! Tino, you almost finished? (This ain't purple neither Tito)
This blunt almost out right here (I don't know what this is)
I love you man (I'm not smoking this)

In the DA mouth shit, here's a root canal
Right on center street, put 'em on front street
Next day the front page, who gonna front on me
Girls deranked and chumped, call 'em skank and cunt
Take a trip with the Dip bitch, to the bank to stunt
Serena Williams, downtown vacant and Trump
Who want to bang her rump, chump, yes I bring the pump
That's why I'm kinda hyped, because my money's good
Which means my mind is right, so I got time to write
How I grind at night, Next tab, china white
Army hat, army jacket, yesir my line is right
Diminish his army, we finished the Don P
Now let's get purple like Grimace and Barney
Holla

[Cam - talking]
I gotta come in now, I don't know what Tito's rolling up
I gotta roll it up my self (I don't know what's in them Dutch Masters)
If you don't crush your own weed up
And put it in the blunt yourself
Your own brother'll hand you some dust

But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga

Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out asap

Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a icey white
I'm real icey right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is what's really good?

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?

I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'

They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?

Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?

One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them

Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her

Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?

I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty

I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh

You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
What's really good? Me motherfucker
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this

Big bucks, big drugs, if I get caught, then it's big cuffs
Big bailor gets up, I get out, shit what, this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One that's new and strong, not old and hollow

Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
I'd take a slug, eat a bullet, swallow a gun

Damn, this type of love, could only come from a son
Hold up mommy, I'm twisted I'm drunk...listen

I need the love I left behind

Hold back the dawn awhile
This will all work out
Don't let this dream die
There's a fire in the sky
It's like the light in your eyes
Thinkin' of you
And I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again

Now the night is dark with diamonds
And I'm standing inside the rain
Giving up your love
Was the worst mistake I made
There's a sound I hear in the distance
Seems it's calling out my name
Well I'll pay most any price
I just hope I'm not too late

Turn back the clock awhile
Things will all work out
That's what the dream is all about
There's a fire in the sky
It's like the light in your eyes
Oh, it's true
That I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love 

Turn back the clock awhile
Things will all work out
That's what the dream is all about 
I see a fire in the sky
Just like the light in your eyes
Thinkin' of you
That I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love",Fire in the Sky,1982
The Dirt Band,"Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dust
When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost
He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read

[Chorus:]
The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go

Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal

Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home
They never caught me

Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal
All want me for their own

[Chorus]

So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon
The fish ran away with the moon
The fish ran away with the moon",Fish Song,1982
The Dirt Band,"I don't need the same excuses 
All this talk is really useless 
You run for cover 
Everytime I'm close to you 

Don't want to hear about the others 
There's something here we should discover 
Let's make a little magic 
Before the night is through 

Oh, you've seen it all before 
And heard the same lines, 
But if you're willing to take a chance 
It could be all right, so fine 
We'll find ourselves dancing by firelight. 

So don't you try to change the subject 
Or try to put yourself above it, 
A boy could get pneumonia sitting next to you 
That's true 

A little sleep is all we're losing 
It's up to us to do the choosing 
Let's make a little magic before the night is through 
Make a little magic before the night is through 

Ooh, to the blue skies 
Where no one can reach us 
It may sound crazy but just hold on tight, 
Never has a love run deeper 
Baby my heart is true 
Baby my heart is true

The Dirt Band,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

The Dirt Band,"I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
To carry mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by?
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I said to the undertaker
""Undertaker, please drive slow
For this lady, you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go""

I will follow close behind her
Try to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in her grave

Went back home and home was lonesome
Since my mother, she had gone
Found my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

The Dirt Band,"Well, she saved him from whiskey,
Was his constant companion.
You'd see them out riding at dawn.

She gave him his reasons 
To shoulder the seasons,
But now when you see him
He's riding alone.

She lay down beside him
To touch him and guide him,
Turn 'round his head
On the darkest of days.

He still sits beside her,
Remembers her smiling
And whisper to him
That old song he would play.

Please lay down beside me,
I love you.

Like this... everybody make a fist
That be the size of the shroom that I ate
I am so high that I intoxicate, anybody lookin' at me in another way
Gonna get a watermelon thrown at them yep yep I got em
Oh f*ck can't feel my nose I can't feel my toes
I'm gonna lay down on them, I'm in a full meltdown trippin on the way
The tree blows and the way the wind caught them
It's time to come to grips I got a long time til I hit bottom bottom
Bottoming out on the trip and psychotically flowing on all the ju ju
I'm not them, I'm proud enough to get up out of this chair
I'm proud enough to stop pullin' my hair
I'm proud enough to get another mushroom outta my backpack
Yo sitting right there, gonna sit back close my eyes
For I gotta get a move on back to life
This is the re-up and now is the time
Mushrooms on my mind

What have these mushrooms all done to my mind
Going back in time floating on my ride
What have these mushrooms all done with my mind
Seeing purple lines swinging through on vines

How many kinds of the mushrooms have you really ate
I focus on eight comfortable ones that are no correlate
Yo, you never can't tell when you eat them
Poisonous or in salt don't eat them, treat em, do a lil' bit of thought
Freedom, freedom, fighter when I wanna fight, fight
When I'm in the night shade and I know I gotta eat them, eat them
I sit in my room and I bubble the water for tea
Quicker to get in the blood stream, quicker to trip on the light beam
Quicker to give it to y'all, dirtball you got me f*cked up
Why the f*ck you do this to us, didn't really wanna get this high
Why you gots to make me fry, look man feel bad but it ain't my fault
I'm the one over here yo stuck in a vault
Where the vault come from don't know
But I gotta put a halt to the mushroom god
Can't see a mutha f*ckin' thing like I'm in a fog
And nobody seemin to care that I'm dyin' a miserable death
With no one to call, no one to call and nowhere to fall, nowhere to fall
I'll leave it to y'all, you too can be tall
The thinner the fat the bigger the small, they call me the ball
I'm really the one that can give you the psilocybilic advice
Now won't that be nice?

What have these mushrooms all done to my mind
Running through the pines my head feels wrapped in twine
What have these mushrooms all done with my mind
Mushrooms I won't decline wash them down with wine

The Dirty Dozen Brass Band,"With their cardboard hands by their sides,
Here`s a naked man and lady
And they`re yours to cut out and keep
So you can dress them up maybe
They don`t know just who they are, or who they`re supposed to be
You can make them happy or sad
Or assume their identity

So here they are in the departure lounge
It`s the ""Gateway to the East""
She is just another mail-order bride
She doesn't know he`s a kinky beast
So he gives her a picture of Maradona and child
She wants to ""roll and rock""
As he spills his beer over her, bumps and he
Grinds, as he repeats ""Bangkok""

[Chorus:]
There must be something that is better than this
It starts with a slap and ends up with a kiss
Begins with you bawling and it ends up in tears
Oh my little one, take that chewing gum out of your ears

She might as well be in the jungle
She might as well be on the moon
He`s away on a business trip, in Dusseldorf, but she`s becoming immune
To the lack of glamor and danger in a West-German city today
The nearest she comes to the ""Dynasty"" he promised her
Is a Chinese takeaway

[Chorus]

Though he only taught her three little words, it
Doesn't matter if they`re dirty or clean
He can only control what they look like
He can never possess what they mean
Now he wants to whisper in her ear
All the shrinking nothingness
But something always comes between them,
I wonder if you can guess

The Dirty Dozen Brass Band,"One day you`re going to have to face
A deep dark truthful mirror
And it`s going to tell you things that I still love you too much to say
The sky was just a purple bruise, the ground was iron
And you fell all around the town until you looked the same

[Chorus:]
The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie from
Your tongue trips
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror

Now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts ring to the boots of roustabouts
But you`re never in any doubt, there`s something happening somewhere

You chase down the road `til your fingers bleed 
On a fiberglass tumbleweed

You can blow around the town, but it all shuts down the same

[Chorus]

So you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks
They set him up, set him up on the stool
He falls down, falls down like a drunk
And you drink `til you drool
And it`s his story you`ll flatter
You`ll stretch him out like a saint
But the canvas that he splattered will be the
Picture that you never paint

[Chorus]

A stripping puppet on a liquid stick gets into it pretty thick
A butterfly drinks a turtle`s tears, but how do you know he really needs it?

`Cos a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey`s hand,
Jesus wept he felt abandoned

Did you ever see a stare like a Persian cat?

The Dirty Dozen Brass Band,"All the children testified that Miss Macbeth
Wore a fishbone slide in her cobweb tresses
Her eyes were black like first foot coal, clutched as white as chalk-dust
Her fingers sweated India-ink and poison-pen letters
There is a hungry hanging tree, just below your bedroom window
You can hear her take a broom to beat out a tattoo on the ceiling
Her bloodless face ran red inside but was she
Really evil, was she only pantomime

Now the chalk on the wall says that somebody
Saves, that somebody`s face has just been washed off the pavement
Into a puzzle where petrol will be poisoned by rain
Miss Macbeth saw her reflection
As confetti bled it`s colors down the drain

[Chorus:]
And everyday she lives out another love song
It`s a tearful lament of somebody done wrong
Well how can you miss what you`ve never possessed?
Miss Macbeth

Well we all should have known when the children paraded
They portrayed her in their fairy tales, sprinkling deadly Nightshade
And as they tormented her she rose to the bait
Even a scapegoat must have someone to hate

And everyday she lives out another love song
""You`re up there enjoying yourself, and I know it`s wrong""

Well how can you miss what you've never possessed
Miss Macbeth

Sometimes people are just what they appear to be
With no redemption at all
We try to walk upright when we can`t even crawl

Miss Macbeth has a gollywog she chucks under
The chin and she whispers to it tenderly Then sticks it on a pin
And it might be coincidence, but a boy down
The lane, that she said ""went white as he could do,"" then doubled over in pain

Tell the time.
Tell the time.
Tell the time.
Does something else exist beyond the sky?

Will the angels walk or will they fly?
A familiar voice I haven't heard in years.
Tell me what to do in seven years.
And if its not my time can I come back?

Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.

Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.

A storm rolls in
But still I'm safe.
I find myself
Within a cave.

The lightning strikes
Like a spiderweb.
I catch my breath
On a concrete bed.

I can't remember 
Certain things,
Like when and where
I got these wings.

The storm had passed
And the day was bright,
And each step
Seemed aflight.

Now I've met
My guardian,
My lease on life
Renewed again.

Peace has 
Overwhelmed my soul,
And the toll collector
Takes its toll.

Can I have 
A few more days,
To take in
Just a few more rays?

Live the life 
That I'd always hoped.
And tend the plants
That I meant to grow.

Meant to grow.
Meant to grow.
Meant to grow.
Does something else exist beyond the sky?

Will the angels walk or will they fly?
A familiar voice I haven't heard in years.
Tell me what to do in seven years.
And if its not my time can I come back?

Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.

Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
And I didn't have the urge to fight.",The Tunnel,2002
The Disco Biscuits,"I was cutting the rug
Down at place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who
He said, ""Hey there, fellow
With the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you""
I said, ""Excuse me""

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean
Big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun on me
""Oh, wait a minute, mister
I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you'd let me
Ask one favor from you""

""Oh, won't you
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps toward the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see me no more""

For, sure

Well the crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
Well, you could hear me screaming a mile away
I was headed out toward the door

""Oh, won't you
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps toward the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see me no more""

The Disco Boys,"Native these words seem to me
All speech directed to me
I've heard them once before
I know that feeling

Stranger emotions in mind
Changing the contours I find
I've seen them once before
Someone cries to me

Chorus:

O O O O
The look and the sound of the voice
O O O O 
They try, they try
O O O O
The shape and the power of the voice
O O O O
In strong low tones

Forceful and twisting again
Wasting the perfect remains
I've felt it once before
Slipping over me

(Chorus)

Sweetly the voices decay
Draw on the lines that they say
I'd lost it once before
Now it cries to me

(Chorus)

And watch, as something seems to happen somewhere else

Up and away from the bar fights and neon lights
Out and away from everything that makes me what I am
So I’m not unsympathetic

that's a fact

He says common sense is such a scam, and I'm like 'Dad, what do you mean?, oh' 

He says you're either wrong or right and life will go on either way, whatever 
you chose....but I know...

That anger's all right..and bitterness no.

There are days when a warm look from a strange face will make me forget my name
There'll be nights when you wonder where the party's at now
And you wonder why you never split this beat scene when a higher life awaits
There'll be days when you don't know how you picked the wrong life
In a second when it's over in our own minds -- and it's gone without a sound
There are fights that'll hear things that we know we don't mean
And we say 'em 'cos we don't know what we both want and we can't get to the other side

There are years that'll fly like wind across a flood plain
Unaware of its own weight, free of friction, and immune to its own speed
There are weeks that'll crawl like slugs across a hot road
Only moving 'cos it just don't know how to stop on a search for god knows what
And there are songs that'll make your skull ring like a dropped cup
Resonating with the reasons why you worked through -- and the reasons why you stayed

For the long nights when you found a new resolve that I never knew was there
For the cold eye and the warm embrace now
For the righteous vibe that I need like the air I breathe

There are times when you'll think you've got my funny number figured out
There'll be days when I don't feel like 
I ever knew you all that well and there are lines
Drawn around, behind, above and over everyone
In an effort to figure out the place and time
The right, the wrong, the yours, the mine
And I'll be damned if I feel like I will ever know anything
But if don't keep moving on that last hill

What will we do to become famous and dandy

It's quite a spectacle to see us land
In waste receptacles as if we've planned it
We're never skeptical when we get branded
Then disrespectful 'cause we feel abandoned

The height of mediocrity is the challenge
Crawling through the entrails of imbalance
We learn to like to be the heroes
We learn to lie to the brand name Negroes

We learn to laugh to avoid being angry
We learn to kill and learn to go hungry
We learn not to feel, for protection
And we learn to flaunt when we get an erection

What will we do to become famous and dandy

We're born believing we're greater than circumstance
Infinitely stronger than chance as our first breath is handed
We taste the double standard, the need to wear the mask
And with society's nurturing, the psychic plastic surgery

Begins to take effect as our souls watch astound
Our characters flounder, duplicitous identity
Diction and contradiction have become the skills of assimilation
Razor honed to perfection from the moment of creation

It's gone from identity crisis to survival slingshot to rifle
Sin to revival, try to get looked at but not poked in the eyeball
Warned of our impurities, afraid of insecurities
Real life experts of the artificial, athletes and entertainers
Have become the minstrels on commercials

And we reflect the images presented by the media's elite
Positive or negative attention is viewed as success
U.S.D.A. African American Beef is seen as progress

We never ask ourselves too many questions
Too much truth in introspection
Maintain the regimentation and avoid self-degradation
We act out all the stereo types, try to use them as decoy

And we become shining examples
Of the system we set out to destroy
'Cause even in the most radical groups you will find
That when you stray from the doctrine, you'll see hard times

Bitch this bitch that was the flavor of the month
Being a thug was the flavor of the month

Then no to drugs was the flavor of the month
Kangol was the flavor of the month
Rope gold was the flavor of the month
Adidas shoes was the flavor of the month

Then bashing Jews was the flavor of the month

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I might be able to listen in silence to your concerns
rather than hearing everything as an accusation
or an indictment against me

I would tell you that sometimes
I use sex to avoid communication
it's the best escape when we're down on our luck
But I can express more emotions than laughter, anger, and let's fuck

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that I pooped in my own dog dish
And sometimes I would rather face not eating
than face licking it clean
And admitting when I'm selfish
And I'd tell you that I'm suffering
from the worst type of loneliness
The loneliness of being misunderstood,
or more poignantly
the loneliness of being afraid
to allow myself to be understood

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
I would tell you that the personal revolution
is far more difficult
and is the first step in any revolution

If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics
If ever I would stop thinking about music and politics

I would tell you that music is the expression of emotion
And that politics is merely the decoy of perception",Music and Politics,1992

The OPEC nations began to dominate
The world's oil economy
In the 1980's, Japan became the world's
Number one economic power

In 1989 the nations of Eastern Europe
Attempted to restructure
While in the United States civil rights have
Collapsed at the hands of fundamentalists
And national insecurity's at an all time high

Exxon and on and on and on
The ministers of double speak
New meanin' of clean they tried to teach us
They staged the phoney shampoo of the Valdez greases
Completely jheri curled the beaches

Pipe bomb for the NAACP
And a hit on Salman Rushdie, the Berlin Wall comes down
And the U.S. cracks down on illegal aliens
Ban the freedom of choice for those wantin' abortion
And enforce capitol punishment

Twenty four hour radio ban
For indecency determined by the F.U.C.C.
Why are we so anesthetized to the lies?
Because we do it in our own lives
We believe all the things that we want to hear
But then we also love to criticize

In 1997 the city of Hong Kong will become

While in the United States
Civil rights have collapsed at the hands of Fundamentalists
And national insecurity's at an all time high

Helms said ban the photograph of the piss Christ
It's sacreligious not an art
While we all try to discern between our cup of tea
And what we call obscenity, the house's legislation
Ripped the phoney foundation off what we thought inherent

Sent Joey to the Supreme Court
'Cause he made a statement, they called it
Desecration of the symbol that was meant to represent
The freedom of so called choice and dissent
They almost had me believin' it, they were bleedin' him

The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy,"It all seemed so idiotic all the accusations of unpatriotic
The fall we'll always remember, capitulating silence
Election November before the winter
Of the long hot summer
Somewhere in the desert
We raised the oil pressure
And waited for the weather
To get much better
For the new wind to blow in the storm
We tried to remember the history in the region
The French foreign legion, Imperialism,
Peter O'Toole and hate the Ayatollah
Were all we learned in school
Not that we gave Hussein five billion
Not of our new bed partner the Syrian
And of course no mention of the Palestine situation
It was amazing how they steamrolled
They said eighty percent approval
But there was no one that I knew polled
No one had a reason for being in the Gulf
We waited for congress to speak up illegal build up
But no one would wake up
Our representatives were Milli Vanilli's
For corporate Dallas Cowboy Beverly Hillbillies
With perfect timing
The politicians rhyming their sentiments
So nicely oil gold and sand
My sediments precisely
We regretfully support the lunacy
I'm afraid there is no time for more scrutiny
National unity preserve our community
TeflonÂ© election opportunities
Were in profundant abundance

On January second the Bush administration
Announced a recession had stricken
The Nation the highest quarterly
Earnings in ten years were posted
By Chevron
Meanwhile a budget was placed in our hands
As the deadline in the sand came to an end
So much for the peace dividend
One billion a day is what we spent
And our grandchildren will pay for it 'til the end
When schools are unfunded
And kids don't get their diplomas
They get used for gun boat diplomacy
Disproportionately
Black or brown we see
Bullet catchers for the slave master

Then the conservatives called up reservists
To active service left families nervous
But more importantly broke nine hundred a month
But the check came late, army red tape you see,
This golden opportunity
We watched the tube and read the newspaper
The propaganda of the gas masked raper
Was the proper slander to whip up the hatred

The stage was lit and the lights were all faded
The pilots in night vision goggles Kuwaited and
Generals masturbated
'til the fifteenth two days later they invaded
Not a single t.v. station expressed dissension or
Hardly made mention to the censorship of information
From our kinder and gentler nation
Blinder and mentaler retardation
Disorientation
The pilots said their bombs lit Baghdad
Like a Christmas tree
It was the Christian thing to do you see
They didn't mention any casualties
No distinction between the real
And the proxy
Only football analogies

We saw the bomb hole
We watched the Super Bowl
We saw the scud missile
We watched BudÂ© commercials
We saw the yellow ribbons
Saw pilots in prison
We never saw films of the dead at eleven
Angela Davis addressed the spectators
And shouting above a rumbling generator said
If they insist on bringing us down
Then let's shut the whole country down
Marching through the downtown
A hundred thousand became participants
And we heard the drums of millions off in the distance
Rushing through the cities
Some of them did things that weren't so pretty
Most were there for primal scream therapy
News men concentrated
On the negative liked the jingoists more
Peaceful protesters ended up
On the cutting room floor
NintendoÂ© casualties of the ratings war
More bombs dropped than in World War II
On in both Asian invasions, new world order persuasion,
Business as usual
For our nation
Could you imagine a hundred fifty thousand dead,
The city of Stockton
Coffins locked in when we clocked in...not to mention
Civilians
The loss of life on both sides
Pushed the limits of resilience
The scent of blood in our nostrils
Fuel of the fossil land of apostle
The blackness that covered the sky was not the only thing
That brought a tear to the eye or
The taste of anger to the tongues
Of those too young to remember Vietnam

Is heroin better in a veteran's mind
Than the memory of the dying laying in a line
Is it the smell or the shadows heaving and weeping
That keeps the soldier from sleeping
As he sings the orphan's lullaby
When the soldiers put down their bayonets
The strings are chained to the marionettes
Emir of Kuwait gets back in his jet
We replace the dead with new cadets
Will we hate those who did the shelling
Or will we hate those who weren't willing to do the killing
When the leaders of the bald eagles come home to roost
Will we sing a song of praise and indebtedness
For our deliverance from evil
Or will we sing a song of sadness
For the dreaded debt this mess delivered us PEOPLE.",The Winter of the Long Hot Summer,1992

I'm your governor Pete Wilson, ya know
The baddest governor to ever grab the mic and go
Boom!
Gimme a budget and watch me hack it!
Gimme a beat and I'll show you how to jack it!
I give the rich a giant tax loophole
I leave the poor living in a poophole
At time when Aids is in a crisis
I cut health care and I raise prices
Sales tax, snack tax, excise tax
Information attack with a newspaper tax
Hit the pocket books of working families
Increase tuition at the universities
Some day I'll command all o' you
Even your kids are gonna pray to me in school
Soon I'm gonna be the president
You might remember the last one this state sent

want to be known as the Great Incarcerator
I'll blow environmentalists away
And I'll be the fuhrer some day

even though we rang 54th in the nation
I've got a plan for all the minorities
Send'em to the California Youth Authorities
From San Francisco Urban Elementary
to Pelican Bay State Penitentiary
There they can work for the master race
and always wear a happy face
Close your eyes, it can't happen here

'Cause she's been accused of growing hemp
Don't worry it's only a shower
And now for your clothes here's a pretty flower
Gonna die on malathion gas
The serpent's egg has always been hatched

The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy,"The first day of school was always the hardest
The first day of school, the hallways the darkest
Like a gauntlet
the voices haunted
Walking in with his thin skin, lowered chin
He knew the names that they would taunt him with
Faggot, sissy, punk, queen, queer
Although he'd never had sex in his 15 years
And when they harassed him it was for a reason
And when they provoked him it became open season
for the fox and the hunter, the sparks and the thunder
that pushed the boy under, then pillage and plunder
It kind of makes you wonder
how one can hurt another

But dehumanizing the victim makes things simpler
               It's like breathing with a respirator
It eases the conscience of even the most conscious
               and calculating violator
Words can reduce a person to an object, 
               something more easy to hate
An inanimate entity, completely disposable, 
               no problem to obliterate

[CHORUS:]
But death is the silence
in this language of violence
Death is the silence
But death is the silence
in this cycle of violence
death is the silence

It's tough to be young, the young long to be tougher
When we pick on someone else it might make us feel rougher
Abused by their fathers but was at home though
so to prove to each other that they were not homos
The exclamation of the phobic fury
executioner, a judge and jury
The mob mentality, individuality was nowhere
Dignity forgotten at the bottom of a dumb old dare and a numb cold stare
On the way home it was back to name calling
Ten against one they had his back up against the wall and
they reveled in their laughter as they surrounded him
But it wasn't a game when they up jumped and grounded him
They picked up their bats with their muscles straining
and they decided they were gonna beat this fella's brain in
with an awful, powerful, showerful, an hour full of violence
Inflict the strictest brutality and dominance
They didn't hear him screaming, they didn't hear him pleading
They ran like cowards and left the boy bleeding
in a pool of red 'til all tears were shed
and his eyes quietly slid into the back of his head
dead...

[CHORUS]

[2x]
You won't see the face 'til the eyelids drop
You won't hear the screaming until it stops

The boy's parents were gone and his grandmother had raised him
She was mad she had no form of retaliation
The pack didn't have to worry about being on a hitlist
But the thing they never thought about was that there was a witness
to this senseless crime, right place wrong time
Tried as an adult one of them was gonna do hard time

The first day of prison was always the hardest
The first day of prison, the hallways the darkest
Like a gauntlet
the voices haunted
Faggot, sissy, punk, queen, queer
Words he used before had a new meaning in here
As a group of men in front of him came near
for the first time in his life the young bully felt fear
He'd never been on this side of the name calling
Five against one they had his back up against the wall and
he had never questioned his own sexuality
but this group of men didn't hesitate in their reality
with an awful, powerful, showerful, an hour full of violence
Inflict the strictest brutality and dominance
They didn't hear him screaming
They didn't hear him pleading
They took what they wanted and then left him bleeding in the corner
The giant reduced to jack horner

But dehumanizing the victim makes things simpler
               It's like breathing with a respirator
It eases the conscience of even the most conscious
               and calculating violator

The power of words, don't take it for granted
when you hear a man ranting
Don't just read the lips, be more sublime than this
Put everything in context, is this a tale of rough justice
in a land where there's no justice at all ?
Who is really the victim ? Or are we all the cause, and victim of it all ?
