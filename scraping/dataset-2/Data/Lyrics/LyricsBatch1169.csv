The Poni-Tails,"Born too late for you to notice me
To you, I'm just a kid that you won't date
Why was I born too late?

Born too late to have a chance to win your love
Oh why, oh why was it my fate
To be born too late?

I see you walk with another
I wish it could be me
I long to hold you and kiss you
But I know it never can be 

for I was 
Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too late?

Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too la-a-a-a-ate?

The Poor Things,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Don't Say I'm Sorry,2000

Saying ""come little boy

We'll smile like the French Resistance
And laugh at the guillotine

Of life around them
So they created a world of their own

At the hour of twelve o'clock at night
Who should I see but the Spanish lady

A maid so sweet about the soul

Combing her hair so trim and neat
First she brushed it
Then she combed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all my life I never did see
A maid so sweet since I did roam

As I walked out through Dublin City
As the sun began to set
Who should I see but the Spanish lady
Catch a moth in her golden net
First she spied me then she fled me
Hitchin' her petticoat over her knee
In all my life ne'er did I see
A maid so fair as the Spanish Lady",Spanish Lady,1997

With a broken bottle in his hand 
Screaming:

Dragged him away from his crucified Lord 
Beat him up in a meat wagon

I said my name is Forrest Gump
Then I blew his arm off with my twelve gauge pump

The Popes,"The minstrel boy to the war is gone,
In the ranks of death you'll find him;
His father's sword he has girded on,
And his wild harp slung behind him;
""Land of Song!"" said the warrior bard,
""Though all the world betrays thee,
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee!""

The minstrel fell! But the foeman's chain
Could not bring his proud soul under;
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again,
For he tore its chords asunder;
And said ""No chains shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and bravery!

They shall never sound in slavery!",Minstrel Boy,2002

I'll be there when they wake with screaming
At the hour of death then I will nurse them
To have a moment more to curse them

Hear the angels call above them
Watch them as the cold air sucks them
Down to hell, goodnight, God love them
If any should escape above me
Beg and cheat until they trust me
Drag them down to be damned with me
Laugh at them as they forgive me

Still the moon shows no light
This rose is withered, may God deliver
The rake at the gates of hell tonight

On the earth, alone, unfettered
Til they pray for consolation,
Til they beg for sweet damnation
Then I'll come and bring them water,
Bring them hope, bring them laughter
Raise their hopes so sad and sunken
Slash them up as they lie there drunken
Push them down into the foul mud
'Til they choke up on their own blood
Drag them out before their last breath
To take away the mercy of death

Smiling proud and young
Around the hemp, around his neck
The golden ringlets clung
There was never a tear in his blue eyes

On the bridge of Tuam today

Shining steel in hand
Behind him marched in gray array
A stalwart earnest band
For Antrim town, for Antrim town
He lept into the fray

On the bridge of Tuam today

Dismayed with faces wan
From Verners house and fishers cut
Along the banks of Bann

The Popes,"Last night as I lay dreaming
My way across the sea
James Mangan brought me comfort
With laudnum and poitin
He flew me back to Dublin
In 1819
To a public execution
Being held on Stephen's Green
The young man on the platform
Held his head up and he did sing
Then he whispered hard into my ear
As he handed me this ring

""If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet
My mother gave to me!

This snake cannot be captured
This snake cannot be tied
This snake cannot be tortured, or
Hung or crucified

It came down through the ages
It belongs to you and me
So pass it on and pass it on
'Till all mankind is free

If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet
My mother gave to me""

He swung, his face went purple
A roar came from the crowd
But Mangan laughed and pushed me
And we got back on the cloud
He dropped me off in London
Back in this dying land
But my eyes were filled with wonder
At the ring still in my hand

If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet

The Popes,"Long years ago I fell in love
With a lady proud and fair
So passionate were she and I
We made fire in the air
I loved her more than life itself
She loved me just the same
And it broke my heart
To think we'd part if she ended the affair

But I was brutal, I was ignorant
I was cruel I was brash
I never gave a damn about
The beauty that I smashed
No sadist I, I took delight
In making my Love cry
Now I'd pray for a single kiss from her
To be lashed and crucified

And now I feel this lady fair
Can never more be mine
Long gone are night in my lonely bed
All suffering and crying
And though I fear that through this life
She'll only call me friend
Til I'm dead and buried in my grave
My Love will never end",The Song with No Name,2002

The Angel of the East is calling
And with a trembling hand
I open up a can

Before I open up my eyes
I can feel her love inside me
But then I realize
My girl with green eyes
Is no longer there beside me

Vicoria, you left me in opium euphoria
With a fat monk singing Gloria
My girl with green eyes

Only you see that I am lazy
Don't care about fame
Nor money like a child
And I'm just like a child
Who's forgotten how to smile

I have nothing to bother about
It seems that I'm different
Seems that I am strange

I'll put my pipe aside and hit the road
However far away I have to go
To find my girl with green eyes

It's because the reason I got my hands on you
Dancing like a stripper
We super cold head to toe
We sharp as a machete
We the hottest show in KCMO
The new Malcom & Eddie yeah
It's me and Big Yates
He know my spits ate
Shit so sick he got me spitting on The Mixed Plate
Like a disgruntled employee who just quick Gates
You read the front of the fitted homie and it's
KC
Ask who the president and they are going to
Say
Me
And now I'm rocking with the king (TECH N9NE!)
So every time we hit the clubs like a movie scene
Filling them women with their cups with Kansas City Tea
PHENOM!

[Chorus]

That's the noise you make you lady do
Fresh hypemen had me on the turn tables in 82'
Sleeping with women and popping bottles
While he was eating baby food
Murdering raps and spitting facts
Something I was made to do
See I raised a few eyebrows when I started up
Veteran Click gave me worldwide we was hard to touch
Ya'll can start the fuss
And I'm going to close you down
Popping you dick licker
Only when there is hoes around
Oh
That's what your girl be like
Killer city will show what that world be like
My world be tight
But my flows be sicker
Behind the counter and cut you
At that Paul's Liquor
I'm a show me nigga
I rep for the land
I got kool aid pumping through your man's heart
I've been marked
And respect the niggas who've been whacked
Fuck with Tech and Irv at the club and spin racks

& when it's only you I need,
I wonder will you be by me,

you must have known what I was going through,

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

The Posies,"Friday comes with little warning
Saturday is close behind
Then you sleep in Sunday morning
Monday back out on the line
Bitter friends go passing by you
They pretend that you're not there
It's their affection they deny you
So you pretend that you don't care
You're not to blame 'cause you were never
Made aware

Chorus
(that) it all comes back
In good time and that's a fact
It's all right--at least for now

A healthy dose of deep depression
Keeps you comfertably smug
Life without you can't imagine
It's become your favorite drug
Once you had your own direction
And all your thoughts were clean and clear
Now gazing at your own reflection
Makes you want to smash the mirror
You can never listen but I know that
You can hear

Chorus

You can always worry
You can always think that you're wrong
But never say you're sorry
For something that you've never (x2) done

The weight of the world is on your shoulders
You've seen so much and your so young
But you'll have to wait until your older
To understand all that's been done
Stand your ground because the battle has
Just begun
",At Least for Now,1988
The Posies,"Well I've felt worse and I have felt
Better than this
I've made a pacifier
Out of my fist

Well I don't care when bones are bare
The mind can't interfere
And what I've said outside my head
Anyone can hear

Maybe I praise you 'cause I cannot praise myself
Won't you just take
A compliment from me?

Perhaps they're understated
And a little overmasked
If they were hand delivered
It would be more than I could ask

Forwardness ain't my business
But you can fish for compliments
While I beg for forgiveness

I'd like to reap the flatteries I sow
But I really cast seeds of doubt
Looks like you take them from everyone
And everyone hands them out

Self mutilation just ain't my trip
But now this is worth the trouble
Cut me open with your laughter
I bleed complementary colors

Tender seedlings trampled
And overwatered boughs
Won't you just take
A compliment from me?

Perhaps they're overstated
And a little undermasked
If they were what I really meant
It would be more than I could ask

Forwardness should be my business
But you can fish for compliments
While I beg for forgiveness

Well I have tried every approach
And they always leave me empty
But each one has it's special way
Of making everyone contempt me

It seems rather selfish to want to be loved
Or to love and expect you to care
But my batteries don't run on flattery
And it just gets me nowhere

Oh when was I ever promised
I'd get back all that I gave?
But I wouldn't care if you'd take
A compliment from me

Perhaps it's too late
Or too much to expect
But compliments that come no strings attached
Well, they're certainly the best
Thing for me, I adore you
But you can fish for compliments
And I won't be there to bore you

How did it happen
Was it preconcieved or a complete accident

We were once happy together, smiling faces
Things have changed
And now you're only happy when I remember where my place is

I don't want to have to live up to your expectations (What do you expect?)
I don't ever want to be the one to end relations (I don't want to end)
I may hate you sometimes

I'm not too sure
I understand the tactful planning
That I must endure
But you call me immature because

I'm too sensitive to your insensitivity
I had the audacity to ask you to talk to me
The stones I throw shatter your sea of tranquility
You're about as human as the statue of liberty

But maybe you'll like me too (x2)

Kiss me, oblige me as if that's all
I want from you
Then ignore me at the party
I invite you to
What did you think I'd dare you do

Maybe I'd lose my sacred knack for subtlety
Perhaps you'd reveal that you actually like me
Did you ever think that I'd just bow out quietly
All I wish is sometimes you would sit down next to me

And if you would like me too (x2)

Well maybe I can't force you to
Stand up and obey my will
I doubt you'll ever touch me or
Love me which is bettter still
I deified you once but
Now I'm standing on your hill
I see you eye to eye
And you're shrinking out of my sight
So before you have passed my line
Let's lower ourselves to each other

Thinly tie me to myself though you
Remain so free
I've tried in vain to demonstrate how you're
Tied as well to me
But you'll come around eventually


Practice makes perfect and you practice perfection
But it's just a stage and I hope that some day when you're done

That maybe you'll like me too
I hope that you'll like me too
And if you would like me too
I pray that you'll like me too
",Like Me Too,1988
The Posies,"I understand sometimes
What you go through
Is just too much to handle
For a person like you
Seems that whatever you take is way too much
That whatever you give is never enough
It's not too late for you to
Learn how to survive
And in your times of trouble
I could keep you alive

Chorus
You're really not that different
You're just like everyone
You go under easy when you get overdone

I've seen your situation
Happen before
And if you say you'll listen
I will tell you more
But I get the impression that you don't want to hear it
That whatever I say will not make a difference
None of my words will ever
Make you realize
And on you own you'll never
Learn to compromise

Chorus (we all go under easy...)

Under all of us is the same ground
It's so easy to get knocked off of your feet
In spite of everything you let yourself down
'cause on your feet you only stand to be corrected
Well in reality that's to be expected
It's something you should have expected a long time ago

Well it's really no excuse and aren't you self abuse
Are you really seeking savation (I've tried to explain)
Moutains have been moved and theories have been proved
All within the duration (all you do is complain)
So when your show is over and all is said and done
I think it fair of me to say that you're not the only one
Who's acted like you had until their world has blown asunder
Either swim for your life or I'll watch you go under

You think that you're exceptional, you're just like everyone
We all go under easy

(repeat under all of us...corrected)
And you can argue that you've been misdirected
Well in reality that's to be expected
It's something you should have accepted (x3)

Is blowing in one head and out the other

You will recognize and realize
Even when you can't forget
The times they tried you, things denied you, inside the big nameless house
From which everyone moves away, everyone moves away
Growing up in severed states of mind
Can cause you to to blind more than twice
And now we're hurt by the words we've never said
The wounds you never bled
Just aggravate your head until they've gone
But you will like yourself
You will verify and vocalize
Even when you can't forget
That when you stayed you, they betrayed you, inside the big nameless house
From which everyone moves away, everyone moves away
Try to wipe away the traces of people, places, childhood spaces
Etched upon your memory, like the way that we were raised
In our backyard we were left no time to think
The blood that turned to ink splelled neglect
Now there's no sun and the grass is overgrown
The sacred seed they've sown is utterly alone and scared to death
But you will free yourself
You will cut the cord and cauterize

From which everyone moves away, everyone moves away
Everyone moves, everyone moves

The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears

And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it

You had never planned on us being so separated

The Posies,"The lines across your face are drawn with hate
Cause I'm drawn to someone else
(looks like you could use a little sleep)
I had some I didn't mention
You caught me coming late (framed by the door)
Onto a floor that's freshly waxed
And hides my tracks and raises
Some important questions

I ask you to be nice - it has no effect
And I suspect that you suspect
But didn't I say feelings are the last things to make themselves felt? 

Don't make me explain myself - you don't need to know
What's going on in my big head right now
It could appear that I should have a statement prepared, but
Don't make me open my big mouth

I use that for an excuse to exit
Looks like you don't buy it
And I'm trying your patience
But what I leave unsaid sticks in my head
The guilt puts me in a spotlight
Looks like I might reveal
You're not my sole engagement

I ask you to shut up - it's as I didn't
Know myself I wish you didn't
Know that I can't turn back, but I didn't plan to tell you that

Don't make me explain myself - you don't need to know
What's going on in my big head right now
It could appear that I could want to defend me, but
Don't make me open my big mouth

You tell me to get out - I can't get out of it
And I wish that we both could split
But splitting doesn't mean the end of the backlash that I couldn't defend

Don't make me explain myself - you wouldn't like what you find
Inside my, inside my big head
It could appear that I would want to reassure your doubts
Don't make me open my big mouth

Don't make me, don't make me,
Don't make me, don't make me,
Don't make me open my big mouth

Were not I weary I would have caught her
I watched for a moment and scrambled in

Words of disownment were drowned out with 
laughter

I awoke from a peaceful sleep and found 
my clothes under the table

part of Mary's fable

Suddenly Mary fell in the water
I found myself married to somebody's 
daughter
""Loving,"" she told me
""Is a question of bravery""
But when she started to hold me
It was closer to slavery

clothes inside the icebox
I used to stand on my own two feet but 
now I sit when my new wife talks

The Posies,"Isn't it nice how things resolve
To test your will would take the skill of crazy ants
You fit your mind into smaller and smaller jars
You find them clutching the last straw
As if it's worth the worse for wear and tear you look
But why try to understand someone that you don't even know
Even though he brought you up, beat you up,
Shut you up when you cried ?
And now you avoid parties
Because they remind you
Of someone who you used to know
Pretty soon you'll want to avoid yourself
A popular phrase from the same year
Would draw no tears save for the fears of looking back
You find you hide for weaker and weaker reasons
The battle you lost in the mirror
Earned you no thanks but wooden planks were soon withdrawn
And you couldn't run away even if you tried
And you tried and you cried 'cause you knew that laying flat
In your parents' car
And now you avoid father
Because they remind you
Of someone who you used to know
Pretty soon you'll want to avoid your own
And now you're finally on your own
You draw your choices from the voices you despise
You find you're drawn to tighter and tighter circles
Flashbacks, flashes forward
You are insane though you have gained such wide appeal
And all the car rides, cheap insides, laughter at the right people
At the right time at the right line in the right frame of mind
And now you avoid thinking
Because it reminds you of someone you used to know
Pretty soon you'll only think about yourself

Take me back - apology
I never meant to be and I won?t take much with me

If it illustrates the nonesuch nomenclature...

So push the button ring the bell
Behold your tongue it?s served you well
Enough to bring you here, won?t you please...

I mean it in the best way
To have it be true

For a friend to heed the slack behind the pull

At the hands of a holy woman in a holy place
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog
Saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes
Lived in the shadow of the mountains
With the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather
And the polished wood of his bed
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river
Holding the hands of his mother
And the wax paper bag of yesterday's bread

And his father on the other side of the world
On the ships railings and some far away tide
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad
In his far away eyes
In his far away eyes

The smell of the wax on the wooden floor
Mixture of polish and soap
No children to fear or to play with
Rows of empty hooks for the coats
An upright piano and the boys in the choir
Still remind him of just before he was born
Remind him of just before he was breathing
Strange misty visions of God
Turn the cities into families
Into villages of souls
Hovering in the air while they're sleeping
With their houses invisible
Chase the moon between the buildings
Running as fast as I could run
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas
Whispering, ""You're the only one""

And ever since I was a boy
I never felt that I belonged
Like everything they did to me
Was an experiment to see
How I would cope with the illusion
In which direction would I jump
Would I do it all the same
As the actors in the game
Or would I spit it back at them
And not get caught up in their rules
And live according to my own
And not be used, not be used
To find the fundamental truths
It was going to take some time
Thirty five summers down the line
The wisdom of each passing year
Seems to serve only to confuse

Daddy came out the navy and took us away
To his dirty grey home town
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service
So that he could be around
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust
Of his Triumph motor bike
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner
Holding tight

From the horizon
Came home from the Navy to the mine
From the horizon
To buried alive
Took his dream underground
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes

And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine
Of a half remembered afternoon
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain
Found the boy, decided that his time had come
Came down out of the sky
Stung him in the face

Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory

From crimson to black

Fades to a point where it doesn't fade

Shell tell you its the only way to be

To a life where nothings gained
Or nothings lost
At such a cost.

Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind.
Ain't life unkind?

In the delta sun 
Oh, but she sure could sing 
Yes, yes 
She sure could sing

Looked down and he took a little pity 
The whole town swore he decided 
He help her some 
And he 
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty 
For deep inside his heart he knew 
She was the only one 
Oh, but she sure could sing 
My, my she sure could sing 
She had faith and she had believin' 
She led all the people together in singin' 
And she prayed very night 
To the Lord up above 
Singin' hallelujah 
Oh, hallelujah 

They ... 
Would walk singin' songs by the river 
Even when she knew for sure 
She had to go away

Never knew what her life had to give her 
And never had to worry about it

The Presets,"I stole the keys to the skies
We'll leave this place for the final time
No crying words, no goodbyes
Yes tonight we're burning all the tough times

Drown all the fears that we had
These are the things that we'll never understand
This time fight fire with fire
'Cause baby tonight the world belongs to you and I

This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
(Under city, under city lights)

Don't tell the world what we've known
We've come so far but there's still a way to go
It's dark, there's no need for lights
When the fire in his eyes is so bright

This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
(Under city, under city lights)

Tonight, turn out the lights
Don't wait, too late to die
Look out, hold on, hold tight
Tonight, all night I'm getting ready so

The Presets,"Once I was a very young man, and very young man are none to clever
Sailed across to faraway lands
And far away towns of tin an terror
Ran amok in a strip called love
Lost my mind in the streets of neon
Now I’m coming on back
Help me up move right, left foot forward
Oh we had a merry old time, but merry old times don’t count for nothing
Cocaine, song and women and wine
Memories blur and they make me shudder
Bed in the morning, eight, four, five, couple of days to get my head off

Now I’m coming on back
Help me up move right left foot forward
To Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho
(Oooo ooo oooooo oooo)
I’m troubled by gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghosts in heaven
Oooo ooo oooooo oooo

Far below the shiniest stars, shiniest stars won’t shine for ever
Take your soul and you can go far,
If you don’t fall from grace of favor
Golder weights are those who star
You can take now and I’ll take never

Now I’m coming on back
Help me up move right left foot forward
To Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghooo Gho Gho

Soon I’ll be a very old man, and very old men they dream of summers
Spent with falls in faraway clans
While hometown crowds sing hymns of courage
Ran amok in a strip called love
Lost my mind in the streets of neon
Now I’m coming on back home
Help me up move right left foot forward",Ghosts,2012

Little plane tossed 'round by a southerly
And when I stepped outside the streets were clean

But I know deep down lies undiscovered
Past the bone foundations of a town corrupted
Under creaking piers, under iron cover

Through fears and fervour, past lies and secrets
Of ink stained, panic-stricken 5 star heathens
Under storms of hell, through tropical fevers
Excitement of the first days of bushfire seasons
All those planning disasters, monuments to the masters
And the dog dark dealings of its backroom bastards
Every long lost dream, every failed endeavour
Every ice beer trail of a rum rebellion

Now I, huddle these feelings of pity
Watching new years colours rain down on the city
Where our beautiful beaches suffer photo ops
To watch schizophrenic tourists get shot by cops
Generation of kids with the toughest teeth
Still haunted by the visions of shocking ink
Where little old ladies die afraid and alone
Now surrounded by yuppies small bars and coke, I

Up out all night, in bright lit wonderland
Communicate online with, I don’t understand it
With the music taste abominable
Man I’m worried sick for a youth in trouble

Seen pictures that I pray I never had to see
Like the ṗros make me so uncomfortable

You say you're happy but your mind is slidin' sideways

I say she's happy, that's all that matters

You say she's happy, that's all that matters now

And I got a chance to tell you, face to face
How I feel about you darling now, I say

You're a lunatic to love
You're a lunatic to love
You can hold my hand to stand up
Hey Lunatic

I dropped you off at the asylum on a Friday
You looked like hell but I said that you looked okay
You spent the weekend flailing round the trailer
I had to tie you down and strap on you inhaler

I wish that I could help you feel the cold breeze
Set up an IV of sanity
Say there's a spy in one half of your brain
Spyin' on the other half and it's drivin' you a little insane

But you're happy, that's all that matters
You say your happy, that's all that matters
Your clothes are crappy and your brain is badly battered
You say your happy, that's all that matters now
That's all that matters right now

When I rescue you from those concrete rooms
Where they keep you tied up to your bed
Giving you shots of electricity every morning at 7 am
It's enough to drive a sane person crazy
Baby let me tell you how I feel about ya

You're a lunatic to love
You can hold my hand to stand up

Carla the stripper, straight from L.A.
You seem cool for a naked chick in a booth
Let's be pals someday (in other words)
Put some clothes on and call me
I saw you, it was incredible
Slim, relaxed, buyin' wine at the QFC
On a snowy Saturday night
Black pearls, and I swear you were drinking beer
You were the redhead behind the counter there
I'm the one who fell out of his chair there
You had your dry cleaning and I think you're dreamy

The Presidents of the United States of America,"I had a girl and she did me wrong 
I didn't let that kind of shit go on too long
Split the clouds and divided the sea
Showed that evil girl how nasty the Tiki God could be
She didn't call no more nor bother me 
My little Tiki God made sure I'd live in peace
One day I read they found a body in the river
Tiki God, make me shake, make me shiver

I got a Tiki God, saves me, I got a Tiki God

When Bobby Brady found the idol in the rubble
Had no idea it would cause so much trouble
When Greg tried to throw it back in the ocean
There was a rumble, an awful commotion
Don't ask me how, but the Tiki found Bobby
He thought the idol was some Hawaiian hobby
Turned out the God was mean and vicious
Didn't respond to Bobby's 3 wishes

He had a Tiki God, saves him, he had a Tiki God

So when you're caught up in an evil plot
Your life's in danger and you can hear the shots
Your head is spinning and you're fading fast
How long do you think this kind of fun can last
Your luck will change with a simple motion
I found my idol in a bottle on the ocean
Splits the clouds and divides the sea
And shows those evil guys how nasty Tiki Gods can be

Bewildered and deluded,
Have I been hit by a truck.
With my tongue inside his [...?...],
Felt like the time in the womb.
But I woke up with a headache that split my skull,
Alone in the room.
I got down on the floor with my head pressed between my knees,
Up to my neck with my teeth sunk into my own flesh.
I said, baby, oh sweetheart.
Lust turns to anger,
A kiss to a slug.
Something was sticking,
On the shag rug, look at the tiles.
I remember the way he groaned,
Moved with an animal skill,
My face in the sweat that ran down his chest,
It's all, very, run of the mill.
I noticed that his scent started to change somehow,
His face went berserk, veins bulged on his brow.
I said baby, oh sweetheart.
Bondage to lust,
Abuse of facility.
Blackmailed emotions confused,
The demon and devilty.
I was sure his attentions were sweet,
And that mine were as well.
But a wish is a shot in the dark,
When your coin's down the well.
I got out in the hall with my teeth in my head,
Up into my neck I said, said, said,
Dead.

I have a simple request,
I hear you know god could you give him a nod in my direction,
I would be in your debt, perhaps
There is something that we could work out,
I noticed your breathing has started to change,
We could go in the back behind all
These stacks of bibles and get out of this cage

With another woman in the bed I made
And so I put him in the grave
And now there's no one left around
To get me off when I want its a drag

By the circumcision that I made
And now I'm on the run but wait
Why did I have to go and kill him

We won't send you away,

Let your mind drift away.
See shells whistle,
Let yourself hide away.

Men walking tall
Looking so small.
Green trees of life disappearing.
Mouthing the sounds.
Face clowning the frowns
Black the lips of command.
Torn in the heart.
You're playing the part
Courage it is so demanding
Loud brass in bands.
Marching through lands.
Life snatching hand is near.

Heaven's army falls upon.
The skirts of mother earth and then flies skywards.
Twisting wings through the air
Lift the souls,
So you might know his fury.

[Chorus]

Dressed in white silk of rain
You marry the pain.
As you kneel in a church of bright steel
A new morning arrives.
You share the same skies.
Umbrella-ring a land full of peace
As the memory fades
On the edge of a blade.
You'll return you 're sure that you will.
From the frame in your hand
A smile expands.
Hangs from a thread of glass tears.",Private Sorrow,1983
The Pretty Things,"When you move in right up close to me

The Pretty Things,"They say that bearing crosses is a religion in itself
But honey the strain I'm under, it's ruining my health
When we first met as lovers, we walked together hand in hand
But now that bridge of love has shattered, I'm such a lonely man
I'm not gonna be your monkey,
I'm not gonna be your fool
I'm not gonna stand round waiting
While you're out there trying to be cool
At the bitter end.
Well you listed all my virtues honey, and you charged a real high price
Well given this set of circumstances, I don't think that's nice
I'm not gonna be your monkey, I'm not gonna be your clown
I'm not gonna stand round watching as they lower you down
In the ground
At the bitter end.
I'm like a knight in shining armour, honey do I detect some rust?
I'm moving one step higher, honey tell me, honey tell me, honey you must
Well I gave you all my confidence, and you gave me back just lies
I recognise amongst our best friends, most of them are spies
With all this poison in the system, love was murdered from the first
And though I practiced eastern logic, I just cannot break the curse

The Pretty Things,"In the concrete valleys the electric storm.
We members of the midnight circus,
Our bodies so brightly adorn
In your long sedans and your Oldsmobile,
Through that slit in your face, you ask me,
How it feels. 
Can you hear me, can you hear me,
I'm a-telling you again.
Daughters of Satan all stand in line,
With faces greased and a mouth full of shine.
With iron hand you bruise the flesh,
Then through a closing door you ask, 
Pray why the distress.
Hear me, can you hear me, can you.
Midnight sailors can stay,
We won't send you away,
See me here on my knees. 
You lie in the alley, with blood on your clothes.
As fingers round your throat they close.
Your cries of murder, splash on the walls
As you die, you think about the injustice of it all.
Can you hear me...
Hear me...

They have such good appetites,

Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

In all our trials born to be our friends

To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

A letter from America?
Take a look up the rail track

I spent the evening thinking about
All the blood that flowed away
Across the ocean to the second chance

I wonder how it got on
When it reached the promised land?

I've looked at the ocean
Tried hard to imagine
The way you felt the day you sailed
From Wester Ross to Nova Scotia

We should have held you
We should have told you
But you know our sense of timing
We always wait too long

Sutherland no inure
Lewis no more
Skye no more

Will you ever return?

To a dying mutual friend

Do we not say we love her?
Do we have to roam the world
To prove how much it hurts?

hey....this life is a long fight
even when the lightening strikes

Stro
i've got my armor and artillery
hands on a weapon in fact that's ready to attack all enemies
living with a life given back to the creator
an out of shape soldier in a swamp full of gators
on the mission i've been given it's deep
i'm forgiven so i've got an innervision of peace
in the rhythm of life i breathe
i'm fighting with a fire inside that burns brighter
till the final bell rings

Mr J Medeiros
I was born in a violent storm in an endless fight between right and wrong
i write songs like letters from war
stuff a message in a bottle then i send it to shore
encouragement for the men and woman who lost steam
rebel music for my people who been swimming upstream
yo some things are not what they seem
who you thought was the peasant might just be the King

Hook

Rez
I'm learning total humility brought by humidity
frustration draining to the sides of my face
feel cry from your grace tears seep into my cheek
every crease in my face is a stroke of war paint
just battlefield journalist capturing a picture of this
combat mission from a complex prison
wage war on my inner that's riddled with imperfection
my sword swung high as the storm subsides

Mr J Medeiros
I was not made just so i could decay
these songs aren't played just so we can get paid
i walk in the Way and the Truth til the Light works through me
i ain't afraid to say the word beauty
i ain't afraid to be odd
i know the path is hard but somehow im getting closer to God
knowing by His scars i am healed i kneel in the storm

The Prodigal Sons,"Black is the color of my true love`s hair 
Her lips are like some roses fair 
She`s the sweetest face and the gentlest hands.

But some times I whish the day will come 
That she and I will be as one

But satisfied I never can sleep 
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines 
And suffer death ten thousand times

Yo we from Hempstead as close to the shacks as Parkside

[Chorus]
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style

Welcome to the PSG I represent
The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em
I straight up skin em like wolves 
I wish you would have been 

Fakin' jack and get ya whole hood hit
But it's all good 
We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood

So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it 
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet

While y'all was droppin' I was underground shadow boxin'
Layin' low puttin' final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin' to snatch that dough
Got niggas breakin' camp like Dre from Death Row

From the streets to the jail, I represent well
Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail
Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save 
Grade up in the U.S. now let?s get this paper

[Chorus]

I'm yawnin' while I wake up to the early morning gun-fire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed tried to break my alarm
Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm

Grab my Pelle Pelle 'cause I want to look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instincts
I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck

I'm stuck, in this environment can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started 
Plan A square one there's no escapin'
So I pun and realize my too

I'm tryin' to live a full life before my time is through
Clock's tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals
Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it

(To all my kiko's)
It's sort of like a family brawl
We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again

Drinkin' straight from the bottle warm gin drippin' down my chin
For the crippled children you can't win 
Against 25 niggas bent up with mac-10's
Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict

So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it
There's many different levels of the criminal mind
Either you're in it for the gusto or I'm wastin' your time

[Chorus]

Now is you ready for men, 'cause they your peeps that you saw
You probably heard about me and my crew doin' what we do
For my nigga True and Smif-n-Wessun
'Cause I be wreckin' mic-checkin' fools that come around second-guessin'

I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky
Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high
The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label
'Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal

What's my time to shine my design you can't define
It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
To have you buggin', niggas got they tapes dubbin
Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin' and shovin'

Now it's over, walkin' like a soldier I told ya
Shorty droppin' bombs and shit, like Oklahoma
Kinda soul, comin' wit that bomb for sure 
Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour

[Chorus] 

First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The cream'll have you shittin' on your people
Livin like lotto, everything is everything

Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army in techses

And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been tryin' to blow for years
Gettin' bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet

To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you're lookin, you can find me risin' to the top
I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked

Floatin' in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic
I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky

While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

Cut your face with a knife, now your scared for life

When I entertain, It's like I took Sedrick for his name
Hunger is just a different form of pain

I'm ready to eat, ready to hear my name spread on the street

To the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks
To the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week

Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler

Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin

To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen

Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss

Hurry up ma! Put your socks, put your slippers on! 
see'mon ma hurry! (Alright then, I got it)

Uh, yeah (ooh ooh ooh ooh) 
Uh (ooh ooh ooh ooh) 
Uh-uh-uh uh-ah uh-ah-uh-ah 
I started in Brooklyn, comin up in the game 
Everybody has a story mine wasn't the same 
Angela, delinquent, I thought I was grown 
I went through a lot things way before I was known 
See my moms, she never knew I would make it all start 
She was through with the bad grades, the late nights in the park 
Causin my mom pain, my life was in the dirt 
I played hooky all day while she was hard at work 
Sorry ma, know it was hard and my pops was a jerk 
She packed her shit and got us out of there before it got worse 
Moved the fam to Miami in hopes of changin my ways 
A big portion of my mind still remained in a daze 
It wasn't 'til we came back my life matured 
Success would be the only thing that I was fightin for 
I was determined to get there, and keep it hot 
Since that day my only goal was to reach the top 
[Chorus: The Product G&B] 
To every little girl, on every block 
That's comin of age tryin to reach the top 
I said no matter who you are, you can reach the stars 
But never forget, how fragile you are, cause a girl is fragile 
[Angela Martinez] 
It's crazy, when I think back, sometimes I have to cry 
Cause when you young, you don't see how life can pass you by 
You don't even really care if you gon' starve or not 
This go back to ninety-three when I got the job at Hot 
I used to answer the phones for Flex, do overnight spurts 
Back then, I was like, ""Hey who knows? It might work"" 
I wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin 
Cause in ninety-five, I was every day, six to ten 
I put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners 
I secured a fanbase, although some of them dissed us 
I was new at my thang, but I was doin my thang 
And I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang 
But of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was 
Cause although know I'm in, I wasn't made what I was 
Through the heat, kept it movin, throw the haters a smile 
What would they do if they knew her heart was fragile? 
[Chorus] 
[The Product G&B] 
Angela.. (uh-huh) Angela.. (hahahah) 
Angela.. (wooh!) Angela.. (uhh, uhh) 
[Angie Martinez] 
Overall, it's a rough business, it could stop even you 
There's people that's gonna say things that's not even true 
Like the one about me not bein down for my women 
And I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute 
How bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him. 
He bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.' 
And I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face 
It'd been different if she said what she said to my face 
As for men, who knows where my story will start 
I went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart 
So I'm chillin for now, it's all about me for the moment 
cause there's things that I wouldn't allow 
But I'ma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow 
Try to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow 
Playin the role like nobody can cramp your style 
But I know, like you know, that you're fragile

We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Just to get up that hill

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player

Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love

She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong

With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

We guarantee it goin' be another hit man, ok?
For your reference, I been inside the house since 6
Bakin' up bars of rap, chiefin' and munchin' on chips
Now should I go dip? debate what style and color to get
We go out, we don't go out, this strickly parkin' lot pimpin'
That there sounds like a nice game plan
Nice thangs wit thick frames, no need to think twice man
Pick up some bud, pick up my boys, wipe off my dubs
Hittin' on chickens and buckets, so what they rollin' on hubs
I'm honkin' my horn like a animal straight from the barn

Aw man, Murph don't want to drive the Benz
But he's too busy tryin' to dodge his friends

Cause there ain't nuttin' like booty in the daytime
Look at it wiggle, sunshinin' on the waistline
And matter fact fuck the whole nine
The whole time I'm thinkin' bout this party goin' downtown

I'm confused. I just don't understand.
Promises, that I heard,
Of great things, were only so many words.
Only words.
I wanted so much more.
We grow up so naive.
Just say it and we will believe.
Believe it.
Too trusting, we made no stand
Until things got so out of hand.
Out of hand.

and there's you standing in my clothes
a perfect picture with you on my side
i never let it show
from the corners of my mouth
i hear your voice come falling down
from the corners of my mouth
can't hear myself at all
i can't seem to find my feet
my body's shaking and
my tongue can't move
i turn my head to speak
i hear you call my name
i hear you calling me
on better days 
on better days
from the corners of my mouth
i hear your voice come falling down
from the corners of my mouth

The Psychedelic Furs,"I see you sing
I don't need your praise
I need a hand, she said
You said it's worth
All that is mine
Prove it, sometimes
Under a moon 
That shines like it's day
It hangs like a star, somedays

I'm getting blind
I see with your eyes
It's too dark, sometimes
Prove it, sometimes
Your head in my hands
Gets darker than night
It's tearing me down, sometimes

The world's like a friend
I find I can smile
Don't say ""don't cry""
Prove it, sometimes
I see you sing
I don't need your praise
You hold out a hand, she said
You said it's worth
All that is mine
Prove it, sometimes
Prove it, sometimes
Prove it, sometimes

Your head in my hands
It's darker than night
It's tearing me down, sometimes

The Psychedelic Furs,"The flowers they cover your feet
All the colors of you
And they shine over all I see
And all I see

Is all of the tears that I spent
Those that fell over nothing
And landed here where I stand
And in my hand

I'm tearing down the flowers sent
And all of them
I'm tearing down your hollow heart
And all of that

All the flags that I rose
That I hung out of windows
And stuck on the sky like crows
But you want more

I'm tearing down the flowers sent
But all of them
I'm tearing down your hollow heart
And all of that

All the ribbons they hung in your hair
And you turn in the mirror to me
And I see you there
And I don't care

I took off all the rings from my hand
Yeah, and all of the birds from the sky
Over where I stand
And you want more

I'm tearing down the flowers sent
And all of them
I'm tearing down your hollow heart
And all of that

I'm tearing down your promises
And all of this
I'm tearing all your flowers down
And all of that and this around",Tearing Down,1991
The Psychedelic Furs,"Until she comes again
I can hear the things she said
I feel no thoughts to move my head
Until she comes again
And with her step
I move my feet
And with her hand
I feel my skin
And with her need
I find I'm saved
And with her dreams
I'm laid
Until she comes again
The sun goes out and night comes in 
The time goes round and day grows dim
Until she comes again
And with her step
I move my feet
And with her hand
I feel my skin
And with her need
I find I'm saved
And with her dreams
I'm laid
Until she comes again
With all my savings and my sins
There's no good reason to begin
Until she comes again
And with her step
I move my feet
And with her hand
I feel my skin
And with her need
I find I'm saved
And with her dreams
I'm laid
Until she comes again
With all her dreams tied in her hand
There is no way to understand

The time goes round and day grows dim
Until she comes again",Until She Comes,1991
The Psychedelic Furs,"With all her talk of all the others
When it shadows everything
And I can't think
About her silence and her rings
I see no place to pin my thought
And where's what's true between the lines
And in her eyes
I see nothing not a sign
And I'm untied
I can't unwind
Your valentines
And I'm untied
I can't unwind
Your valentines
Sunday morning comes too soon
To leave me standing in my light
And there's no time
To set it straight or take a side
And I'm untied
I can't unwind
Your valentines
And I'm untied
I can't unwind
Your valentines
I see no place to pin my thoughts
And where's what's true between the lines
And in her eyes
I see nothing not a sign
And I'm untied
I can't unwind

i saw it yesterday
i'm coming 'round to see you
so you really got to say that
look we've got a metal house
look we've got a game
look here comes my aeroplane 
to take us all away while

up in my plane
looking for my destination

everybody's looking up
they're staring at the sky
look here comes my aeroplane
bringing us the stuff
look here comes my heavy bird
get a suit to wear
look at all the houses
they're dancing in the air while

up in my plane

and i only get sorrow
and yesterday's faded away
now there's only tomorrow
and everything passes and changes
and comes to an end i know
but nothing is written but old news
again and again
i know that it's true
there's too many tears
but angels don't cry
now i see a face in your eyes
but you don't remember my name
we're always a step out of time
now ain't that a shame
and you've been alone for too long
and nobody cries
if you want to see all of my tears
take a look in your eyes
i know that it's true
believe it or not
but angels don't cry
i know that it's true
there's too many tears
but angels don't cry
i could walk away
or i could walk on by
or make it all come true
or say it's all a lie
there's no more tears
when you're out of time
and i might fade away tonight
if you close your eyes
i know that it's true
believe it or not
but angels don't cry
i know that it's true
there's too many tears
but angels don't cry

",Another Edge,1994
The Psychedelic Furs,"i counted down the days
the darkened that i was sad
down like i was it
and shattered down on city road
and shadow dust in cars
the beat a halt in time???
somebody's shouting at your door
without a face to hide
and on the mercy side
her name is tearing at your sleep
with greed and greedy teeth
and all its hungry hands

the sound of celebration
jesus day down on the road
where nothing in me sings
i got to wear my wedding suit
put on a shirt and wash my face
and polish up my teeth
i've got my pocket full of holes
and with a hand i feel my rings
the clatter of your sin
a monkey's dogging at my heals 
and at the side i paint it black
to turn you from my things

The Psychedelic Furs,"
no wedding song
no wedding song can shake my feet
or stop me now
or touch the doubt that makes my faith
come falling down
no edges here can cut my skin
no vanity
no valentine
no gravity can hold me winterland
this day has been a lifetime 
burned down birdland

no valentine
no vanity that that lovers make
can stop me now
i fear the hand that makes my grade???
in birdland
flesh and blood can't be too strong winterland

jesus christ should slap our faces
he should make our faces sing
sometimes it pays to turn your face away
before you shake me out of sleep
when all your tears run through my vains 
in [??] and siren light
tear down birdland
this day has been a lifetime 
winterland

yeah, she's a heartbeat
she's a door at the end of a dead end street
she's a heartbeat
and footsteps i hear her footsteps
here comes rumours and lies
here comes my life of crime
i hear footsteps
when the music goes down
and the traffic is stopped
and nobody talks at all
when they turn up the town
i hear a heartbeat
and i've shut all the shades
and the radio stops
and nobody moves at all
when the city's asleep
i hear a heartbeat
i hear a heartbeat
in the shadows
out in the shadows
it's like walking on glass
it's the end of the show
in the shadows
and sweet dreams
she sells you sweet dreams
it's like movies and trash
where there's always a girl
and she's sweet dreams
when the music goes down
and the traffic is stopped
and nobody talks at all
when they turn up the town
i hear a heartbeat
and i've shut all the shades
and the radio stops
and nobody moves at all
when the city's asleep
i hear a heartbeat
