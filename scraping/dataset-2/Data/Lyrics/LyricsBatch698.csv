Matthew Morrison,"Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,
There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby
Haaaaai

Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
Uuuuuh

Oooh someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow.
Why then, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,2010
Matthew Morrison,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullaby.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly.
Birds fly over the rainbow.
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow [Version],2010
Matthew Morrison,"O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!
How are thy leaves so verdant!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How are thy leaves so verdant!

Not only in the summertime,
But even in winter is thy prime.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How are thy leaves so verdant!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!

For every year the Christmas tree,
Brings to us all both joy and glee.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!

Each bough doth hold its tiny light,
That makes each toy to sparkle bright.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!",O Christmas Tree,2010
Matthew Morrison,"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch!

You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch!

I wouldn't touch you with
A thirty nine and a half foot pole!

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch!

Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty-wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch!

The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote:
""Stink""
""Stank""
""Stunk""!

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch!

Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch.
With a nauseas super-naus
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch!

You're a three-decker
Sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch",2010
Matthew Morrison,"Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay

Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life
Is in books written pages
Lived and learned from fools and
From sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away, yeah

Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until the dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream comes true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away",Dream On [Version],2010
Matthew Morrison,"One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy
But all I do is cry

(Cry, cry, no more laughter)
Oh, I should be happy
(Oh, why did she go)
I only know that since he left my life's so empty

Though I try to forget it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
(I should be happy)
'Cause I still love him so
I end each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out

One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
No more laughter
No more love
Since he went away (Since he went away)
Since he went away

Ooh, A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
Well, I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me

(One less bell to answer) 
Each time the doorbell rings, I still run
(One less egg to fry)
One less man (one less man) to pick up after
No more laughter, no more love
Since he went away (Since he went away)
Since he went away
All I do is cry.",One Less Bell to Answer/A House Is Not a Home [Version],2010
Matthew Morrison,"When Marimba Rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

When Marimba Rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

When Marimba Rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway

When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me",Sway,2010
Matthew Morrison,"I never saw a reindeer fly
Make it's way across the sky
But I know if I close my eyes my wishes will come true
Like the one I've saved for you

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Don't care it's cold outside
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
I'll keep you warm tonight
Through the good times and bad
Happy and sad
I'm still holding on
I know what I have
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you
With you, yeah

The simple things like goin' home
And friends they say you're not alone
Songs of joy they keep you strong make everything okay
Oh and Santa's on his way (on his way) yeah
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Don't care it's cold outside
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
I'll keep you warm tonight
Through the good times and bad
The happy and sad
I'm still holding on
I know what I have
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The sleigh bells are ringing, they're getting real close
I think I hear Rudolph
Just up the road
Candle lights and hearts full of hope
The stars shining bright some things never change

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
My arms are open wide
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
I'll keep you warm tonight
Through the good times and bad
The happy and sad
I'm still holding on
I know what I have
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you

Let it snow, let it snow
The fire's burning bright
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
I'll keep you warm tonight
It's not just the gifts
Under my tree
The best things in life
Are totally free
And waitin' for me is Christmas eve with you
Is Christmas eve with you",Christmas Eve with You,2011
Matthew Morrison,"You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk till dawn
You don't need experience to turn me on
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me and we could have a good time

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

Oh, I think I wanna dance
Gotta, gotta
Little girl Wendy parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta

Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama, not your shoe size
Not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty to have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss",Kiss,2011
Matthew Morrison,"Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it

But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had
And what you lost 
And what you had 
And what you lost

(Ooh)

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again, I see, the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and 
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness 
Like a heartbeat drives you mad 
In the stillness of remembering
What you had
And what you lost 
What you had 
Ooh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh, oh, oh you'll know",Dreams,2011
Matthew Morrison,"When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

(Tears stream down on your face)
(When you lose something you cannot replace)
(Tears stream down on your face)
(And I)

(Tears stream down on your face)
(I promise you that I will learn from my mistakes)
(Tears stream down on your face)
(And I)

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you",Fix You,2011
Matthew Morrison,"I hear the ticking of the clock 
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark 
I wonder where you are tonight 
No answer on the telephone 
And the night goes by so very slow 
Oh I hope that it won't end though 
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own 
I never really cared until I met you 
And now it chills me to the bone 
How do I get you alone 
How do I get you alone 

You don't know how long I have wanted 
To touch your lips and hold you tight 
You don't know how long I have waited 
And I was going to tell you tonight 
But the secret is still my own 
And my love for you is still unknown 
Alone  

Till now I always got by on my own 
I never really cared until I met you 
And now it chills me to the bone 
How do I get you alone 
How do I get you alone 

Alone alone 

I hear the ticking of the clock 
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark",Alone,2011
Matthew Morrison,"Bust it

This here's a tale for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're over zealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous

Okay smartie, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served, and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Said she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

Uh, hey, ya, uh, uh, hey, ya
Just bust a move
Uh, hey, uh, ya, uh, hey, ya, uh, uh

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
And then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next, hey bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
Just bust a move
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""no way""

Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money, and you got no car
Then you got no woman, and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man

So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
Just bust a move
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it

Break it down for me, fellas
Huh, hey, ya, uh, huh, ooh, hey, ya
Uh, uh, hey, ya, ee, uh, uh, uh, ya

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man

You say ""neato,"" check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting

So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And then you're feelin' really fine 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumpin, bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl, and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move

You want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
Just bust a move
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it

Move it, boy

Huh, hey, huh, hey, uh, uh, hey, ya, ya",Bust a Move,2011
Matthew Morrison,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

Matthew Morrison,"And it feels like an endless December that chills
Black máscara that runs down your pretty face
Your smile is outta place, days got you down
But things are lookin' up, (up, up)

Find yourself in a dream with a video sky
And the sound that you hear is like a heart that beats
Moving you close to me, it's like a symphony
That's playin' for us

Two shadows under a streetlight
We're just dancin' in the rain
Bodies flowin' like water
We'll be alright
As long as we don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing
Don't stop dancing, dancing

Pray for time, tell tomorrow to wait for a while
Wanna take the moments and have always been
Back on our feet again, the world is sleeping

I just wanna make you feel the music, music
Throw your hands up in the air

Everything you're looking for
You can find it on the floor

We're just dancin' in the rain
Bodies flowin' like water

Before it gets better baby and that's for sure, mm

At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

With a prince or a vagabond

And may you never love in vain
And in my heart you'll always remain

I would give it all up just to take one ride

Matthew Robinson,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now

And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

[Chorus]

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Matthew Ryan,"I wandered up to what I thought was your door
I'd only been there a hundred times before
I gave it my most polite rap and wish
I held my heart loosely in my other fist

The dead of winter in North Hollywood
The struggling actress and her flash flood
Smell of perfume cash and love
The sucker punch with a horseshoe in the glove

Sayin' if I held you up, would that be enough?
I gave you all that I was capable of
Would that be enough?
Would that be enough?

A trailer park tycoon last June
A telegraph a flash and a boom
An autumn like there never was
A why and because

Hopin' if I held you up would that be enough?
If I gave you all that I was capable of
Would that be enough?
Would that be enough?

",Certainly Never,1997
Matthew Ryan,"It's not the things that
I can't change that bother me
And it's not the things that
I don't know that undermine me

It's not the thing that
I can't hold or the balancing wire
That broke, that throws me

It's not the fact that
You walked out that bewilders me
It's not the sleep that
I can't steal that wires me

It's not the coffee or the pills
It's not this space that
I can't fill that kills me

Well, in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome
It's been bent 'til it was twisted

And in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome
It's been burned
But it's still willing to try and shine

It's not the drunks and their devices
That provoke me
And it's not the politics of love and distance
And all that that shit evokes in me+

It's not the Sunday morning fights
Or this soul on ice that numbs me
And it's not the passing of another Indian
Summer that saddens me

It's no the shutter in the undertow
That bears down on me
It's not everything ending as it begins
Or the loneliness that grins that destroys me

Well, in case you didn't know
I've got a heart made of chrome

Matthew Ryan,"I was sitting in hell's kitchen
Contemplating murder
Contemplating murder
Contemplating the great escape

When you walked in
Looking like crap but satisfied
I swear that you looked satisfied
And I hated you for that

Well, someone once said
If you never look back
Then you'll never regret, nothing
Oh, but nothing
Has got a way of sneakin' up

Well, I know you did not ask
But I've got some comfort to offer
Nothing very good or bad ever lasts

Well, the bum that slipped underneath the fridge
Like a phantom card, we call him happiness
And all that happiness is a miserable son of a bitch

Now the kitchen's getting crowded
And the band is really loud
And there's a fat man saying he's my friend
Well, hey, man, if you're my friend
Will you spot me a drink?

And the couple in the corner
They're the reason why I hate rock and roll
'Cause rock and roll is dead, is dead, is dead

But I've got some comfort to offer
Nothing very good or bad ever lasts

With a cross-stitched lip she's picking at the seams
She's got bravado she says she's been
Featured in a few magazines

Outside the bar Hank is straddling a police car
His fingers are purple and numb from circling crow bar
Well, twenty-four years have made it clear
That things ain't ever what they appear

Now, now, he says, ""I won't be going easily
No, I won't be going lightly
And I won't be going peacefully
No, I won't be going innocently""

A sweet drink spiked with a speed ball
A twenty foot ladder and a ninety foot wall
Dark shadows are gathering
And swaggering down the hall

And I know, I won't be going easily
No, I won't be going lightly
And I won't be going peacefully
No, I won't be going cleanly

Never more
Got so low they had to use
The jaws of life
To yank me up from under the floor
Thrilled to be here
Thank you much
It's strange when nothing gets to taste so satisfying
That you don't mind the rot gut
So me and my sugar we're on a roadtrip
From Bostone to Philly and I don't know maybe St. Louis
Got a patch
From my therapist
Sha's got a heart like a yacht
But she's all screwed up, she's a pugilist
Sorrry Bobby, miss ya Jack
But if I could choose I'd ask to have
Dr. Martin Luther King back
So me and my sugar we're on a roadtrip
From D.C. to Dallas and I don't know maybe Memphis
So when this ship eventually sinks
That'll be alright
Got a friend
In a cracked house
That sits around all day wonderin' who and when
Shot the lights out
But some things won't be explained
Like the cabby that fell asleep in Hoboken
And woke up Shirley MacLaine
So me and my sugar we're on a roadtrip
From Hollywood to the East village and I don't know maybe midland Texas
So when this ship eventually sinks
When this ship finally sinks
When all this shit don't mean a thing
That'll be alright

Here comes I'm sick of groveling
Here comes the only thing that ever happens
Here comes I hate you and I'm giving back all that you gave to me

'Cause lately I've been dreaming of angels and cranes
In some kind of purgatory dodging the CIA
With a head full of soot, waving black flags
Throwing off the bodies just to cut down on the drag

Take 'em to the desert or to a dried up well

Matthew Ryan,"There's only one light on in the house
And that's the light up in the hall
And it's shining on the back of my head

And I'm concentrating hard
On the cigarette, to the ashtray
From the ashtray back to my lips

So I lean up from my easy chair
I rub my three day beard
And give that thousand yard stare
As I recall all the time and the money we spent
Before I became irrelevant

So the straw dog threw rock salt
And the precious girl took a bow and walked
As I ran my finger over the screen door

Yeah, every kiss has reeked of betrayal
Since my heroine jumped the guardrail
And decided who she wanted to be once more

Now, every night I'm paralyzed
By the fear of rope burns and morning light
And the smell of wet cement
Since I became irrelevant

Now, memory's just a flash flood
A thick and black sticky mud
And heartache it's like a breaking bone

It was always twelve hours on a missionary line
You think I would've spared some time
But I didn't, I never went home

Now, it occurs to me like blinds undrawn
Or a bullet from a shotgun
That she knew long ago, oh, what it meant
To feel irrelevant

Now, I'm always smilin', cryin'
And hidin' my intent
Since I became irrelevant
",Irrelevant,1997
Matthew Ryan,"I saw the lights of the Commodore Barry
From the deck of the ghost of the flower street ferry
And I felt the shock of an atom bomb
When the tired old city of Chester
Was draped and dying in my arms
For a while I was lost under the weight of remembering
Of how the sun would warmthe projects some mornings
When the birds were falling like winter's frozen rain
And I was all fingers numb holding a brown paper lunch
Twelve years old and already ashamed
Now soon I was floating over Highland Avenue
By my side was the Red Cross, the Pope and the President too
Yeah I had returned like I swore I would
To right some wrongs and sing my song
And share the luck that every man should
But when the fever broke and I awoke from the dream
I was passed out beside a jukebox siphoning gasoline
When my brother yanked me hard from the corner bar
And carried my drunk bones all the way home
Draped and heavy in his arms
",Lights of the Commodore Barry,1997
Matthew Ryan,"Well, I smoked my
Throat out last night
Hoping you'd call
Or just stop by

Now, I'm wheezing
Like the Oakland sky
Feeling like
The rusted tracks
And forgotten dream
Of the old train lines

It's a perpetual stone
In my shoe
One that I'll always
Be trying to shake loose
An ache in my chest
And a thorn in my side

More than a scratch
Beneath this skin
Somewhere between
The beginning and the end

I don't feel a lot lately
I don't feel whole lately
I don't feel much lately
That's how I hide
That's how I hide

You wrote it down not to
Draw attention to yourself
You let the pilot just
To blow it out

Here the conversation's
Always too loud
And we're as pathetic as the jumper
That listens to the crowd

To say I miss you
Wouldn't be enough
I feel like Tom Waits
Singing, 'Diamonds and rust'
And I'm as pathetic as a junkie
Who knows what he does

It's a perpetual stone
In my shoe
One that I'll always
Be trying to shake loose
An ache in my chest
And a thorn in my pride

More than a scratch

For cover, deep in those dark and lonely hallways of my heart
And there were problems
You said there was something wrong with me
And they were deep-seated they were deep-rooted
I must've pushed 'em away I pushed 'em away
So you left with the impression that if I could just clear my head
You'd be back with me on day
But now you walk the roads with a rose in your teeth
Walking arm and arm with him it's hard to believe that I'm the furthest
Thing from your mind

In the sheets of a big and haunted bed

In a language that shows your age

Your watery eyes and perfume were choking me
But I don't need to tell you how it went
Except that all things beautiful are blurred into sadness

Sadly love, know it will really let you in
I need your little hands to hold my expression
'Cause I've been cursed until the kingdom comes
To always have and miss someone
To always have and miss someone

It was one bedroom with a dog in the thorn
I remember thinking about dad as I was walking out the door
Looking back seeing the girl you never should be
Heartbroke and poor lovesick and lonely

Now I'm off to work
On the train I only stare
There's a sleepy drum
And there's corruption in the air

Only souls have been lost
Desperate is as desperate does
A little push, a little shove
A little talk I give myself

The little things, the little things mean everything
The little things, the little things mean everything
The little things, the little things mean everything

Matthew Ryan,"Slowly walking down the street
Where the homeless and the lovers meet
I bask in ol' blue
Your skin does too
I saw the garland
In the skyline
In the byline

I took a drink
I took the pills
You'll murder me I know you will
Some wish that I could change this
That you were hopin'
I keep hopin'
For a cure
For some medicine
Just one conversation

I can't return to you
You must return to me
That's the deal
I'm sorry
Did I say I'm sorry (sorry)

In a universe where I was flat
You hunkered down and lived the past
You're leaving soon
It's 10 til noon
I see a black car
I'm movin through time
When will we part

I have been the worst of kinds
A sorrowed heart
A cluttered mind
And I'm thinkin' that I could change this
That I could change this
But I can't change this

I can't return to you
You must return to me
That's the deal
I'm sorry
Did I say I'm sorry
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry now

I can't return to you
You must return to me
That's the deal
I'm sorry
Did I say I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry now

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below

And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew is Hallelujah

Deceive it when I can
If I was running and I fell
If it's subsiding I can't tell
Looking at nature through a hole in the clouds

As you take a final bow
The earth creates
A dark and stormy now
But you must answer if it calls
Under the sky and when it falls
Looking at nature through a hole in clouds

Yes
I can explain
Anyone's pain
If It isn't mine to know
Yes
I feel it too
No
No I'm not you
Is that the way you feel

When the first light closes the night
And you feel unusually right

As sun streams it all around
Filling you up with desire

But I love you only to find
I can't have your heart inside mine
On the outside you run away
Having your day in sun

And you won't realize
'Til after it's done
You're back where your dreams began

Before I became who I am
And before you were ever like this
Even though you came to me
Everything but what I see
Having my day in the sun

And will I find myself
After it's done
Suddenly realize
I'm back where my dreams began

I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Sun is gone and I'm on my own in a thunderstorm

Matthew Sweet,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
'Fore the winter fire (the winter fire), I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
And I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?
(Where the time goes)

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go (until it's time to go)
So come the storms of winter (Come the storms of winter)
And then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?

Who knows where the time goes?
Where the time goes?
Who knows where the time really goes?

Who knows where the time goes?

Matthew Sweet,"Sometimes in my words and in my mind
I can't say the things I feel inside
Beat down by my own admitted frown
But this isn't what I've come to say

It's too soon for goodbye
I'll be going away but you're not gonna
Stay here forever, forever
We don't have long

Compared to when we're gone
So look around you now
Listen to your heart
Feel the world go round

No lies since I've got to know my mind
I don't need to figure out what's true
It's all mine, moving forward, losing time
And there's really nothing I can do, can do

It's too soon for goodbye
I'll be going away but you're not gonna
Stay here forever, forever
We don't have long

Compared to when we're gone
So look around you now
Listen to your heart
Feel the world go round

It's too soon for goodbye
I'll be going away but you're not gonna
Stay here forever, forever

Matthew Sweet,"All falls away as closing my eyes I begin
Breathing a strange feeling
Not unappealing
I could be happy to be here

I know the rain only as something to need
While the poor leaves of fall ignore it
My dreams are growing green
My dreams are growing sure, sure

Where do I go? I don't know if I care where
I know you feel so low 'cause I've been there
I'll just keep it in the back of my mind
I can't find the time, I can't find the time

I fear the fire
Needed to warm me inside
Cause as the ice cracks in flow the facts
And everything's slipping aside

I feel the pain coming and going away
It would be in vain trying to lay your claim now
I won't be sticking around
I won't be sticking around

Where do I go? I don't know if I care where
I know you feel so low 'cause I've been there
I'll just keep it in the back of my mind
I can't find the time, I can't find the time

Breaking away when there's no reason to run
Cause like a seed, I need water and sun
My life has just begun
Sure, my life has just begun, every day

Where do I go? I don't know if I care where
I know you feel so low 'cause I've been there
I'll just keep it in the back of my mind

You should know and how
That I burn through love
As easy as you adding two plus two
You should run, don't walk

I burn through love
It'll break your little heart
Every time I turn my back again
I burn through love

Seems I just can't get enough
Of the stuff that really moves me
I burn through love

In no time, nothing seems
To stop my mind from wandering
Could you need me?
Should you need me?

Chances are we'll both come around again
So I let it be, see, no one else but who is in front of me?
There is no one special you need to be, it's only me

Feel fear, feel fear, do you believe, deceive yourself?
Don't you realize you can't be saved?
Feel fear, feel fear, do you believe, deceive yourself?
If you can't feel fear, you've gone insane

And away from anything that you know
Doesn't sound like so very far to go
But it's a million miles war

Just because you can't see another way
'Cause you're not sure what I was going to say
Before you cut me off

Feel fear, feel fear, do you believe, deceive yourself?
Don't you realize you can't be saved?
Feel fear, feel fear, do you believe, deceive yourself?
If you can't feel fear, you've gone insane

I'm still listening to the wind, it's all I hear
I'm still turning inside out to love you, dear
Sun going down and fading me out with it
Chances are we'll both come around again
So I let it be

Don't you realize you can't be saved?

Then I get back right for the daytime

And I hear the signs all around me
And as for the sunrise

All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head

You lured me away from home cause you didn't want to be alone

Find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand

Heads all empty and I don't care,
Saw my baby down by the river, 
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air.

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow, 
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature, 
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside.

She's got everything delightful, 
She's got everything I need,
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double, 
Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet, 
She can wade in a drop of dew,
She don't come and I don't follow, 
Waits backstage while I sing to you.

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm, 
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive.
She's a summer love for spring, fall and winter. 
She can make happy any man alive.

Caught up in sunlight, come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine, 
Come on honey, come along with me.

She's got everything delightful, 
She's got everything I need,
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight,
Lazing in the sunshine yes indeed.

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, 
When the moon is half way down,
Sometimes when the night is dying, 
I take me out and I wander around, I wander 'round.

Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely,
Ride our singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine

And no one hears his lonely sighs,
There are no blankets where he lies.
Lord, in his deepest dreams the gypsy flies,
With sweet Melissa.
Mmmm-hmmm.

Again, the mornin's come.
Again, he's on the run.
A sunbeam's shinin through his hair.
Fear not to have a care.
Well, pick up your gear and gypsy roll on.
Roll on.

Crossroads, will you ever let him go? Lord, Lord.
Or will you hide the dead man's ghost?
Or will he lie, beneath the clay?
Or will his spirit float away?
But, I know that he won't stay,
Without Melissa.
Yes, I know that he won't stay, yeah,
Without Melissa.
Lord, Lord, it's all the same.

It won't leave you alone

Found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean

I saw a picture on my T.V. screen
The Reverend Billy Graham and the people singing
Just As I Am And it felt like
You were talking to me
And the whole world seemed to fade away
Until I heard my mother say
""Son, are you okay? Do you wanna pray?""

I always stayed right there
And I did until my freshman year
But the world was pulling me a long way from thirteen
And you were calling but I didn't hear
Still I knew there was something more
So, one day my knees hit the dorm room floor
I said, ""If you're there, and if you really care
Come and talk to me like I was thirteen""

Got a picture in my head today
Of how heaven might look someday
I see the people there

And as I listen it occurs to me
Everybody's got their own thirteen

Lord, Your wonders never cease to amaze me
'Cause every time I get down upon my knees
I know You hear me

And I've been less than faithful
Oh but You've been more than graceful

But it's just like You to save me
Well, it's just like me to run and hide
And it's just like love to take me as I am
And make me just like You
Well, it's just like You, alright

Well, I could think of a million reasons why
I don't deserve your love
And I could try and try and try
But I could never be good enough

There's a church on the corner in a harbor town 
Where the stained glass lets the sunshine through 
When Sunday morning rolls around 
The people come to hear about the truth

Love has no walls 
Love needs no space or time 
Reach out your heart 

One day a hurricane swept through that town 
Worst storm you ever did see 
Next Sunday morning when no church could be found 
The people still gathered out in the street

Well maybe it's because they know
That the good Lord is watching over everyone of us

Matthew West,"How many times can a heart be defeated
Before it decides to give in
How many times can a soul be mistreated
Before being locked up within

Some days I wish I could make myself cry
And I wonder if maybe this well has run dry
But just when I think my emotions are too numb to feel

That's when You open wide my heart
I can feel You open wide my heart
And I know just the touch of Your hands lets the healing begin
I feel Your river of love rushing in
When You open wide my heart

Each day I stand at the foot of this mountain
And pray for the courage to climb
When I am weary lead me to the fountain
That quenches my thirst every time

Lord, You are the water, my reason to live
When I feel like I have nothing more left to give
Oh, and just when I think I have fallen too far from Your grace

That's when You open wide my heart
I can feel You open wide my heart
And I know just the touch of Your hands lets the healing begin
And I feel Your river of love rushing in
When You open wide my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I fall down
And You lift me up again
Lose my ground
And You bring me back again
Lost and found
I feel alive again

You open wide my heart
I can feel You open wide my heart
And I know just the touch of Your hands lets the healing begin
And I feel Your river of love rushing in
When You open wide

I feel You
Open wide my heart

Matthew West,"Lately all my friends are talking 'bout me 
They see something different 'bout me

Because I don't act like everyone 
I march to the beat of a different drum 
They think I'm going through some kind of phase 

Now they call me names 
I can hear them say 

I'm a sellout 
I'm a loser 
I'm a yes-man 
And I guess I'm never gonna live it down

I must say that my first inclination 
Was to save my reputation 
Try to blend right back into the crowd 
But the more and more I tried to hide 
The less and less I could deny 
The truth was screaming at me clear and loud 

I gave up the fight 
I guess they were right

Matthew West,"It was an ordinary morning
At the school upon the hill
The sun was slowly rising
The flag was standing still
And the students were rushing to face another day

But in the middle of the madness
There was one who made her way
She was standing by the flagpole
But she bowed her head to pray
And she said ""I, I will not be afraid""

She said, who will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love
Hand in hand with each other
By God's grace, who will stand?

Now everyone was watching
Staring at the girl
Some of them were laughing
And calling her a fool
And they said, ""She, ohh she will stand alone""

But then one by one they stepped out
And one by one they came
Breaking form their silence
With a simple act of faith
And they cried, ""We, oh, we are not ashamed, no""

And we will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love
Hand in hand with each other
By God's grace, we will stand

And we will stand up for what we believe
We will stand up for our freedom
And we'll stand up for one nation under God
With liberty and justice for all

We will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love

We will stand, stand together
Heart to heart, reaching out for love
Hand in hand with each other
And by God's grace, we will stand

We will stand, we will stand, together
And by God's grace, we will stand

But you don't recognize your face
And you're looking for a reason
Not to throw it all away

Just go back, go back
To the moment of truth
With three words 'it's a girl'
And she looks just like you

And when this life makes you wonder
What have you got to lose
Go back, just go back

You got your hand on the Bible
But your heart feels like stone
'Cause you think that you've made
Too many mistakes to come home

And you're losing your will
And you're losing your faith
And now you wonder
If you even believed in the first place

To the moment of truth
When you first talked to Jesus
And He reached out for you

He's still reaching
He's still reaching out for you

And bigger breaks than I'd ever care to confess.
Ah, but you're the one who looks at me
And sees what I was meant to be,
More than just a beautiful mess.

Where would I be without someone to save me,
Someone who won't let me fall?

You are everything that I live for,
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me,
With arms wide open, all I know
Is everyday is filled with hope
'Cause you are everything that I breathe for,
And I can't help but breathe you in, and breathe again,
Feeling all this life within, every single beat of my heart

You're everything good in my life,
Everything honest and true
And all of those stars hanging up in the sky
Could never shine brighter than you

You are everything that I live for,
Everything that I can't believe is happening
You're standing right in front of me,
With arms wide open, all I know
Is everyday is filled with hope
'Cause you are everything that I breathe for,
And I can't help but breathe you in, and breathe again,
Feeling all this life within, every single beat of my heart

You are, oh you are,
Jesus, you are,
You are everything",You Are Everything,2007
Matthew West,"What if I told you?
You have the power
To give someone hope
Far beyond their wildest dreams

What if I told you it’s right there in your hands?
In your hands

It's hard to imagine
How something so small
Can make all the difference
Tear down the tallest wall

What if December looked different this year?
What if we all just

Give this Christmas away
If there’s love in your heart
Don’t let it stay there
Give this Christmas away
And your life will be changed
By the gift you receive
When you give this Christmas away

It’s feeding the hungry
It’s serving the poor
It’s telling the orphan
You’re not forgotten anymore

It’s doing what love does
Even when no one’s watching you

Give this Christmas away
If there’s love in your heart
Don’t let it stay there
Give this Christmas away
And your life will be changed
By the gift you receive
When you give this Christmas away

For God so loved the world, He gave His only son
So we could be His hands, His feet, His love
His love

What if I told you?
You have the power
To give someone hope
Far beyond their wildest dreams

What if December looked different this year?
What if we all just

Give this Christmas away
If there’s love in your heart
Don’t let it stay there
Give this Christmas away
And your life will be changed
By the gift you receive
When you give this Christmas away
Give this Christmas away
You have the power
Just give it away
Give it away, give it away
Give it away, give it away

It isn't fair
Your light was bright and new

You're not the worthless they made you feel
There is a Love they can never steal away
And you don't have to stay the broken girl

Love sees them differently
Love sees perfection

Well, I’ve been waiting all year for you to get here
And I can’t take another second, can’t you hear me beggin’
Hurry up, Santa Claus
Here’s my number just in case your reindeer get lost
I sure wouldn’t mind, if you’re early this time
So, come on, come on, come on, Christmas

And I pray they're resting in a better place
I think of memories of years gone by

I think of soldiers across the sea
Sometimes I wonder why it's them instead of me
But for my freedom they give their lives
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

Tears of faithfulness, tears of hope
I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know
There is peace on earth for every heart to find
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

I think of family, I think of home
And say a prayer for those who spend this time alone
Cause love can reach out into a silent night
And that's why Christmas makes me cry

Tears of faithfulness, tears of hope
I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know
There is peace on earth for every heart to find
And sometimes Christmas makes me cry

I think of Mary and the virgin birth
And I'm amazed by how much God thinks we are worth
That He would send His only Son to die

I’ll lay down my life like a truest friend

And scars don’t lie

Always feeling like there was just no way out, no matter what I've tried to do
When I finally hit rock bottom, when I heard them lock me up behind those bars
And it kills me to say I gave birth to my daughter there""

Matthew Wilder,"For a long time we've been
Marching off to battle
In our thundering herd
We feel a lot like cattle
Like the pounding beat
Our aching feet aren't
Easy to ignore
Hey, think of instead
A girl worth fighting for
That's what I said
A girl worth fighting for

I want her paler than the
Moon with eyes that
Shine like stars
My girl will marvel at
My strength, adore my
Battle scars
I couldn't care less what she'll
Wear or what she looks like
It all depends on what
She cooks like
Beef, pork, chicken, mmm

Bet the local girls thought
You were quite the charmer
And I'll bet the ladies love
A man in armor
You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for

My girl will think I have no faults
That I'm a major find
How 'bout a girl who's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind?
My manly ways and turn of
Phrase are sure to thrill her
He thinks he's such a lady killer

I've a girl back home who's
Unlike any other
Yet the only girl who'd
Love him is his mother
But when we come home
In victory they'll line up
At the door
What do we want?

Matthew Zimmerman,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.

You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.

You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,

But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say

Riding shotgun in the sky 

Turning into butterflies

Und kenne das Gefuehl
Ganz allein vor einer Wand aus Eis
Als der Vorhang fiel
Und jetzt steh'n wir wieder Hand in Hand

Wir sind Spieler unter Publikum
Und spiel'n das Spiel nochmal
Was immer ich auch tu'

Ein ganzes Leben lang nur noch mit einem Mann...

Jeder Blick war schon zu viel 
Es kann nicht sein was nicht sein darf 
Und dabei waren wir nun am Ziel.

Will nicht in den Kopf 'rein.

Mit so viel Gefühlen
Zwischen den Stühlen;
Trotzdem
Wir lassen nicht los!

Warum
Ist es nicht mehr wie früher?
Warum sind da and're Gefühle?
Warum steh'n wir hier
Seh'n uns an
Und bleiben doch stumm?
Sag mir warum?
Hab'n wir uns so verändert?
Warum ging das alles zu Ende?
Wir haben doch geschwor'n
Daß uns so'was niemals geschieht.

Ich kann´s nicht mehr zählen
Wie oft haben wir dieselben Gespräche geführt
Mit brennenden Seelen
Da helfen keine Worte
Und da hilft auch keine Zeit

Für 'ne verdammte Ewigkeit

Denn einfach du
Du und ich
Ja das war das Größte für mich
Denn einfach du
Du und ich
Denn was Geileres gibt es nicht
Und wenn du gehst
Es wär' echt schwer
Ich glaub' dann schlägt mein Herz nie mehr
Und wenn das stirbt
Ist alles aus
Nein ich komm da niemals raus
Ich liebe dich
Ich liebe dich

Wie oft hast du mir gesagt
Dass es besser wär'
Wenn wir uns trennen
Manchmal da hab ich gedacht
Ich kann nicht mehr
Uns kannst du voll verbrennen
Da gibt es keinen Ausweg
Wohin soll der auch führen
Wir beide gehören zusammen
Ja das hab‘ ich längst kapiert

Matthias Reim,"Das letzte Wort aus deinem Mund, das war l. m. a. A.
Das hat mir wirklich weh getan, weil da mal so viel Liebe war
Und dieser Blick in deinen Augen,
Als du sagtest: „Schlüssel her, die Tür zu meiner Wohnung, existiert für dich nicht mehr“

Bin grad etwas haltlos
Und fühl´ mich wie ein Blatt im Wind
Wie schnell doch uns´re Träume
Wie so´n Rausch verflogen sind

Aber ganz bestimmt nicht ich
Denn umhauen lass ich mich so nicht

In meinen Himmel rauf
Doch das ist mir egal
Ich bin nun mal so drauf
Ich geb´ nicht auf

Ich bin ein Träumer und ein verdammter Optimist
Und ich bin der Letzte, der die weiße Flagge hisst
Und mit ´nem letzten Funken Hoffnung
Mach ich noch ´n Feuer an
Ich werd´ was Besseres als dich finden
Ja ich glaube fest daran

Und dazu auch noch Nacht
Gleich werd‘ ich wieder los ziehen
Bis Morgen früh um acht

Dich suchen und nicht finden
Das macht mich wahnsinnig
Doch irgendwann das spür‘ ich
Find‘ ich dich

Ich hab dich, das ist irre
Einmal erst gesehen
Und trotzdem war´s sofort
Total um mich geschehen
Wir zogen diese eine Nacht
Durch jeden Club der Stadt
Und da hat´s plötzlich bei mir zoom gemacht

Ich fühlte mich wie´n King
Als ich nach Hause ging
Schien Sonne mir warm ins Gesicht
Seitdem such‘ ich nach dir
Und sag‘ ständig zu mir
Verschollen sein kannst du doch nicht

Irgendwo da draußen muss es dich doch geben
Hinter irgendeiner Tür
Irgendwo da draußen da musst du doch leben
Warum versteckst du dich vor mir
Irgendwo da draußen gehst du heut‘ Nacht schlafen
Dort würd‘ ich gern morgen früh mit dir erwachen
Irgendwann wird es passieren
Darum such‘ ich weiter Suche ich nach dir

Mit dir das war so anders
Das kannte ich so nicht
Ich sah uns in deinen Augen
Und ich las in deinem Gesicht
Die Story meines Lebens
Und alles war so klar
Und ich wusste
Dass ich angekommen war
Und als du sagtest Okay
Ich muss jetzt erst mal gehen
Es war schön also bis dann
Ich war sprachlos vor Glück und hab´s vergessen

Matthias Reim,"Unterm Mond, letzte Nacht, bin ich neben dir erwacht
Wusste kaum was von dir und du gar nichts von mir
Unterm Mond sah ich dich, ich sah dir lange ins Gesicht
Wirst du bleiben oder gehen? Als wäre nie etwas geschehen

War es nur so ein Glücksmoment
Ein Feuer, das schnell nieder brennt
Oder wird aus dieser kurzen Zeit
Vielleicht eine ganze Ewigkeit

Unterm Mond weiß man nie, zählt ein Wort auch noch morgen früh
Wenn die Sonne wieder kommt, dort am fernen Horizont
Unterm Mond verspricht man viel, was man gar nicht sagen will
Wie sehr du mich jetzt auch liebst, was noch kommt, ist ungewiss

War es nur so ein Glücksmoment
Ein Feuer, das schnell nieder brennt
Oder wird aus dieser kurzen Zeit
Vielleicht eine ganze Ewigkeit

War es nur so ein kurzer Rausch
In denen man Zärtlichkeit tauscht
Oder wird aus dieser kurzen Zeit
Vielleicht eine ganze Ewigkeit

Nur der Typ an deiner Seite war vom mir nicht eingeplant

Nicht verstanden, du Idiot

Ich bin gespannt wie lang du brauchst um zu begreifen
Dass du mich nie verlierst

Keine Frage, ich bin draußen, hast mich eiskalt abserviert
Nicht ein Kuss, nicht mal ein Lächeln, hab ich denn nie existiert?
War das nicht die große Liebe, die uns aus den Händen glitt
Bist du gar nicht mehr zerrissen in zwei Teile, so wie ich?
Einer will dich ganz vergessen, doch der andre schafft es nicht
Sprichst mit irgendwelchen Fremden, aber nicht ein Wort mit mir

Matthias Reim,"Ich bin heute morgen aus dem Bus gefallen in eine neue Stadt
Die Bühne wird grad aufgebaut und Bruno packt schon mal die Gitarren aus
Der Veranstalter zeigt mir meinen Backstageraum
Er fragt: „Ist alles soweit ok?
Normalerweise duscht hier die Zweite Herren von unserem FC“
Die Jungs aus meiner Band telefonieren kurz mit ihren Frauen
Ich geh durch einen Traum

Ich bin zu müde um einzuschlafen
Zu K.O. um zu Boden zu gehen
Einfach zu allem zu kaputt an manchen Tagen
Doch ich werd niemals zu müde sein
Um für euch auf der Bühne zu stehen

Und dann bin ich allein in irgendeinem Zimmer in irgendeiner Stadt
Und dann kommen die Zweifel, leise und gemein
Ob ich gut darin bin, was ich so mach
Und dann fällt mir wieder ein während ich an die Decke starre
Wie viel Glück ich doch hab, nach all dem Auf und Ab
Ich greif mir meine Gitarre und schreib den nächsten Song
Und die Jungs von meiner Band reden wahrscheinlich grad mit irgendwelchen Frauen
Ich liebe meinen Traum

Personified.
At her feet, the world,
Hypnotized.

A million flashes,
A million smiles.
And on the catwalk,
She flaunts her style a long mile.

An angry sign of darkness,
Our hope lies lost and torn.
All flame like love is fleeting,
When there's no hope anymore.
 
Pain and glory,
Hand in hand,
A sacrifice,
The highest price.

Like the poison in her heart,
Like a whisper she was gone,
Like when angels fall.

And in this side of darkness,
Our hope lies on the floor.
All love like flame is fleeting,
When there's no hope anymore.

Like the poison in her heart,
Like a whisper, she was gone,
Like an angel, angels fall.","Hope, Vol. 2",2006

Matthieu Chédid,"Mon corps est froid, mon cœur a peur 
Si loin déjà, des jolies heures 
Mon ami, le plus grand, s'en va
Il s'enfuit, comme le vent dehors 

J'entends se briser mon cœur de pierre
Dans la voie lactée ,un autre amour se perd
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison
Tout près de moi chante la chanson

Tu est parti , tu es partout 
Même la nuit me donne des coups 
Sous les larmes, mon sourire, se voit 

Et la femme de cire, s'évade

J'entends se briser mon cœur de pierre

Mon âme entre en danse

Son sourire envieux
Laisse la place
A des gestes gracieux
Qui s'effacent peu à peu

Je tends la main
Pour pouvoir caresser l'ange
Mais il est trop loin
La mort se venge

Pourquoi cette larme que tu as dans les yeux
Je pensais que les âmes ne pouvaient être qu'heureuses
Assises auprès de Dieu

Et bien tu vois mon gars
On t'as menti dehors
Encore une de plus qui croit que c'est mieux après la mort
Tu ignore ton sort

Je te tends la main
Pour pouvoir caresser l'ange
Mais il est trop loin
La mort se venge

It ain't like your numbers make vaccines that heal weak cells
You brag when your money go somewhere besides yourself
I'm going with our voice

And then I'm going down to HaCo
With a chance of makin' it down to flocko
I'm with the Southside kids 'til they reach age

'Cause I believe that we intervene with our knees grey
And go and be changed, then we talk about it
I get it poppin', pop it, you probably got a problem
Before they can stop me, gotta cut my power like I'm Amish
Hold the torch up high in the thick dark
The dream works no matter how bad the pics are

We don't fight for the W
But we fight from the double you
Never said it wouldn't be trouble
But, but he bring trouble to whatever troubles you
As struggles do multiple valuable things that are wonderful
We suffer through, hustle through all the things he wants to humble you
Humble you, take you and break you and make you into another dude
Take away any other truth, he's the one that can comfort you

Humanity has put evil on a throne, destroying the walls we built to contain our hearts; barely keeping us alive.

We've given power to the things that only wish to hold us down. It's time to wreak havoc.

I can't even remember a time when I could stand up for myself. I won't give in, I'll never surrender. No more fear, only fight.

A kingdom reclaimed, the spawn of sin is shamed; reaching from the dirt as darkness falls beneath the Earth. Devouring souls of the ones who chose to stay behind; thrown into eternal prison. I'm the one who's still alive.

Hell awaits the king of lies. The perverse will fall, the beast will burn alive. King of lies.

You brag when your money go somewhere besides yourself

I'm with the Southside kids 'til they reach age

And go and be changed, then we talk about it

Before they can stop me, gotta cut my power like I'm Amish

Humble you, take you and break you and make you into another dude

If we're still on our feet
And there's something to eat
Well you can tell them we'll be there

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Better save a chair

When the party's getting a glow on
And singin' fills the air
If there's gas in my hack
And my laundry is back

If there's room for one more
And you need me
Why sure
If you need a new face or a tenor or base

If I can climb out of bed and put a head on my head
Well you can tell 'em we'll be there.","In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening",1995

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

So quick son pick one, you don't want me to finish

or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

Mr. 1/16th, born to kill your self esteem

Born from part devil, part cracker from Queens

Knowledge that we drop, you don't even build with

That's like me winnin a rap Grammy, givin it to Lyn(?) Smith


[Chorus]


[Jo Black]

Yo, yo

Everything black is wack and shit

Blackheads, blackmail, black cats and shit

Funerals, niggaz gotta wear black and shit

Black cars, black clothes on they backs and shit

Blackballed, if we don't kiss they ass and shit

Blacklisted see ya nigga, and you're gone that's it

White bitches, they wanna be black and shit

Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit


[Double Black]

Aiyyo all the Mau Maus gather up and let's attack

because they're tryin to fuck with our images

and I think that shit is crazy wack

And as a matter of fact, they want us niggaz

to smile and laugh - I guess they never seen a bloodbath

Brothers and sisters are dyin, babies are bein taken out

So what the fuck they want me to rap about?

About how happy I am, to be livin in the slum

where little shorties walk around totin big guns


[Chorus]


Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll


[Hard Black]

Nigga, nigga you think these rhymes?

You think they fuckin rhymes? This this this this PHILOSOPHY

This the end of redneck-ass catastrophes

Puttin a plunger in the, ass of my history!

Forty-one shots of reality for the generations to come after me!

As it be, hell hath no FURY like a black man scorned

Nigga BLAK IZ BLAK, you've officially been warned

Nigga - you've officially been warned

You hear me? You've you you've OFFICIALLY BEEN WARNED

You've been TOLD nigga, you've been fuckin OFFICIALLY been warned

Mau Maus,"

[Hard Black]

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them


[Chorus]

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Mau Maus (HOOTIE HOO!) We was born to roll!

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, aim fire

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

How black? BLAK WOMB TIL WE REACH THE BLACK HEARSE

What's black? - SHADE OF THE UNIVERSE


[Mo Black - Canibus]

Yo, yo

Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

Black monk like Thesalonius, the government got a black phobia

That's why they tap my black Nokia

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Black thugs, wrap drugs in backwoods

Smoke til they got black tongues, black lips and black lungs

Blak iz blak, wack MC's get smacked

Forced to go home and dial 1-800-I-CAN'T-RAP

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

A wonderful dream came to me
I saw Uncle Sammy weeping
For his children from over the sea

They had come to him, friendless and starving
When from tyrants' oppression they fled
But now they abuse and revile him
Till at last in just anger he said

If you don't like your Uncle Sammy
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came, whatever be its name
But don't be ungrateful to me!

If you don't like the stars in Old Glory
If you don't like the Red, White and Blue
Then don't act like the cur in the story
Don't bite the hand that's feeding you!

You recall the day you landed
How I welcomed you to my shore
When you came here empty handed
And allegiance forever you swore

I gathered you close to my bosom
Of food and of clothes you got both
So, when in trouble, I need you
You will have to remember your oath

If you don't like your Uncle Sammy
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came, whatever be its name
But don't be ungrateful to me!

A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Maura O'Connell,"Baby, I know that we've got trouble in the fields
When the bankers swarm like locusts they're turning away our yields
Our dreams roll by our silo, silver in the rain
And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

Have you sees the folks in line downtown at the station?
They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil, no
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
