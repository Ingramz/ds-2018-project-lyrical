Bud Shank Quartet,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go

When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye",Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,1965
Bud Shank Quartet,"I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin",I've Got You Under My Skin,1965
Bud Shank Quartet,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the Moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the Moon growing dim on the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1965
Bud Shank Quartet,"I used to fall in love with all those boys who maul the young cuties
But now I find I'm more inclined to keep my mind on my duties.

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'cause my heart belongs to Daddy.

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
But my heart belongs to Daddy
'cause my Daddy he treats it so well

There was a dame that a football game
Made long for the strong undergraddie
I never dream of making the team
'cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy

Bud Shank Quartet,"You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me

Let me live 'neath your spell
You do that voodoo that you do so well

For you do something to me
That nobody else could do.

Bud Shank Quartet,"You give me your lips and your lips are so heavenly,
Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,
So does the moon in the blue,
All this is mine and heaven too.

You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

You give me your love and your love is a melody,
Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine
And heaven too.",All This and Heaven Too,2008
Bud Shank Quartet,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2008
Bud Shank Quartet,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2008
Bud Shank Quartet,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2008
Bud Shank Quartet,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2008
Bud Shank Quartet,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
",When Lights Are Low,2008
Bud Shank Quartet,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,2009
Bud Shank Quintet,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end;
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall;
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night,1965
Bud Shank Quintet,"Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel, the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?

Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or is it merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel, the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long, long, long last love?

",At Long Last Love,1965
Bud Shank Quintet,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear

But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1965

Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That, darling, it's getting me down

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Budd Johnson,"Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me
Touched my heart and went right through
Now I can't tell you why; I only know that I
Fell helplessly in love with you

Told a story old and new
I can't figure out just why it came about
Or how I fell in love with you

I could say you're grand and therefore
I care for you so
But there is a why and wherefore
And I'd like to know

Now maybe it's because the star I wished on
Made a certain wish come true
Or it just could be that you were meant for me

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew

And if you was in the same situation, it'd be hard for you too
Well don't panic, keep it together, and make your way

And it's a must we keep supplyin, with that fried ice cream
And if anything go wrong while I'm gone, then baby do your thing
When you get to flushin, don't trust, nobody else
Pay attention, it's a must you play them cards that you dealt

It all happened so fast, like a flash

I had to think fast, out the back room I'm rushin
To the bathroom, and start flushin
Quit passin no discussion
I ain't catchin no case, washed away, go down to the hall
No evidence ??? knows, it's evident that we control
Lettin 'em know that we on top, and we got, to step on our toes

It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He was just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standin when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors, by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we plan to make grands of our home
[Number two]

[Verse Two: The RZA]
Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manor
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggaz he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggaz be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S.
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
in his country, even though he sold mad weed
for the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggaz actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
at the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the CREAM
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggaz I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
without a doubt, niggaz who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
and you don't know no fuckin lessons?

Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggaz comin through the trees, like a salamander, bitin
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest

Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless

Left behind I'm always the last. 
I think it's time to let go of this fear 
And try to find a way out of here.

I've got to clear out my head from this mess. 
It brings me down and leaves me in stress. 
I think that with you I made a mistake. 
Now I'm motionless in empty space.

Were you scared to be closer to me? 
What did you fear? 
I let you near but you brought me down here.

Don't you see how everything's holding me back.
Don't you see now everything's holding me back.
I've been hurt, I've been burnt, you could be helping me out.
Don't you see now you're the one holding me back.

You were the one who gave me reasons to try. 
The one who left me with anger inside. 
I heard your need for me had been replaced 
From someone else when you lied to my face.

Were you scared to be closer to me? 
What did you fear? 
I let you near but you brought me down here.

Don't you see now everything's holding me back.
I've been hurt, I've been burnt, you could be helping me out.
Don't you see now you're the one holding me back.

I just wish it all away. 
You just take a piece of me and keep running further. 
Will you ever go away? 
You don't really wanna stay even though you come closer to me.

Don't you see how everything's holding me back.
Don't you see now everything's holding me back.

I throw it all to you

You're the one I call. 
When I fall, When I bleed, 
The one I need, 
You're the one I want,

Can't you hear the voices humming madly 
Somewhere in my head?
But instead of trying I'm just hiding.
Lost in my regret.

I was only nine years old, when daddy left me
Poppa was always up to no good
This one here is dedicated to a very special lady in my life
She's my M-O-M-M-why, she's a very special woman
and dear mom, I dedicate this song to you

[Chorus x2: Unknown sampled singer]
This goes out to a special lady
The one that brought me life
The one that taught me right
She always held me tight

[Buddha Monk]
Hey moms, I dedicate this song to you
You're my M-O-M-M-why, my special brew
I'ma bless you with diamonds and pearls, and rubies too
Well this is just something for the things you do
Momma soon, I'll take you on a real long cruise
Sit back with some class, champagne just for two
You're overdue, so here's some things meant for you
Benzes and minks, friends that you never knew
Private jets, year round trips to Tibet
Ah, you and Janet sand, singin that bangin-ass duet
Finished yet? Malik will pour you Moet
with hand to hand service as the sun sets
You never guessed, the life could ever be this best
Sit back, just relax, you ain't seen nothin yet
You're my girl, my mom and my first love too
That's why I dedicate this song right here to you
c'mon

[Chorus x2]

[Buddha Monk]
Hey moms, they should've made a statue for you
Best moms in the World, yea, baby that's you
You tried to prove, the good times went down the line
Didn't believe, now I'm infested with drug crime
In these hard times and I'm still out to get mines
A motivated soldier on the hands of time
Cops draw the line, now I'm facin seven to nine
And you're still tellin me it's gonna be alright
That's why I love you, no matter all the things I did
Yo, you still turn around and call me one of your kids
When poppa slide, how was you to deal with all of us kids?
Yea, a family of four with the governor's laws
No more, now it's time to take a World tour
Breath the fresh air, we smell the sea shore
I adore, and I want to give you applause
Dedicating this song to you once more
Cuz...

Aiyyo, moms
Let me tell you one thing
I can't express the way that I feel
All the things that you've done for me
I was one of those bad-ass kids gettin up
every mornin, doin all the thug things
You know, I didn't get many whoopins
when I did get a whoopin, it hurt
but I still had to do what I had to do momma
'cause times was hard
and there was no father there for us
but I knoiw you loved me
and I know you'd forgive me for all things I did
but if you didn't, I hope this song finds you at your best 'partment
You're with me in my heart, I love you and you're my favorite girl
I get one, I only get one, I only get one
(You're my momma, yea) My momma
I love you, mother (yea, sweet old momma, yea)
Feel the road to the riches
and riches to the road
'cause I'm gonna leave and go somewhere you've never been before
You're my woman, and I'll always see you
(Don't you want me in this World?)
I always love you to death, momma
We out, baby, c'mon

Buddha inflicts the hoes like Bake's existence

Her skin is smooth, ? than a buck-fifty inch
Dressed up in lace, watered hair, long, black and fake
Her skin is caped, nails done up by fuckin stakes

Gotta somethin to make, checkmate, the plan is goin great
He asked the name, my friends call me ?
He didn't know the plan was to stop his money flow
He lay in the land of the dreams, saw how to suck Stacy's toes

Now Mr. Large comes in from the back row
From where I stand, it looked like he had a fo'-fo'
His mistakes, ah, she burns rubber from the Ac'
Now the nigga lays, just lays flat on his back

Buddha Monk,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in it's cage

I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen

The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke (until she's broke inside)

In dreaded places of the world

Buddha's Last T Party,"Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in

I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms

Oh no
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed in my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved

Why must a true heart be left to pay the cost?
Why must a heart that has been true
Be broken and sad, so empty and blue?

I gambled my heart and I lost it to you
Now I'll spend my life wondering why I love you?
Someday, you'll know why I'm so blue
When you've gambled your heart and you've lost it too

Why must it be the one you want most of all
They'll build you up and then let you fall?
They'll lead you on, you'll think that they're true
They'll love you then leave you so empty and blue

Buddy & Julie Miller,"If I cross your path again
Who knows where, who knows when
On some morning without number
On some highway without end
Don't grasp my hand and say
Oh fate has brought us here today
Fate is only fooling with us friend

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us, it must be all or none at all

It's a desperate game we play
Throw our souls, our lives away
On wounds that can't be mended
And debts that can't be paid
Well I played and I got stung
Now I'm biting back my tongue
And sweeping out the footprints where I strayed

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us, it must be all or none at all

Keep your distance, keep your distance

Buddy & Julie Miller,"Little darlin', love is not a crime
If it is I'll have to do my time
Lock my heart up, throw away the key
I'm a prisoner that don't wanna go free

Come on baby, kill me with a kiss
Come on make me, die of happiness

I know whiskey makes a man a fool
But darlin' whiskey, ain't got nothing on you

Tell the doctor, he ain't got no cure
I'm a goner baby that's for sure
Tell the lawman, he ain't got no gun
That could hurt me, like the way you've done

Come on baby, kill me with a kiss
Come on make me, die of happiness

Love can taste as sweet as muscat wine
But then go down more like turpentine

Little darlin', skies were meant to be blue
Songbirds to sing and I was meant to love you",Little Darlin,2008
Buddy & Julie Miller,"I got a hole in my pocket
I got a tear in my heart
I got a door I can't unlock it
I live on shadows in the dark

I hear the sound of a heartbeat
I hear a secret in the rain
It's like the kiss of a lover
It's like a stranger knows your name

I'm gonna rock on the water
And dance on the flood
I'm gonna lay down with the wind
Lay down and believe like a child
I feel the swell of the tempest
I can feel the passion of a soul
Like there's a storm comin' in
I can feel the storm going wild

And when the thunderheads start beating like a drum
And the thunder cracks the sky in two
The wind is gonna blow and the rain is gonna come
And the river's gonna run

I wanna walk on a wire
I want to walk on an unbroken line
I wanna live when I die
Shake my soul loose from time
I wanna ride with the angels
On that invisible street
And leave my footprints in the sky
And feel the stars beneath my feet

And when the thunderheads start beating like a drum
And the thunder cracks the sky in two
The wind is gonna blow and the rain is gonna come
And the river's gonna run

Gonna take the train that's gonna get me there
All the tracks behind me are burning in the air
The cure is gonna kill me but I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

It's like the kiss of a lover
It's like a secret in the rain
It's like a stranger knows your name
It's like a stranger, stranger knows your name",The River's Gonna Run,2008
Buddy & Julie Miller,"By the banks of the river, where the willows hang down,
And the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound,
Down in the hollow where the water runs cold,
It was there I first listened to the lies that you told

And now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
And the past I remember, time can't erase
The letter you wrote me, it was written in shame,
And I know that your conscience still echoes my name

Now the nights are so lonely, lord sorrow runs deep
But nothing is worse than these nights without sleep
I walk out alone and look at the sky,
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry

If the ladies were blackbirds and if the ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrels with them high bushy tails,
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails",Rock Salt and Nails,2008
Buddy & Julie Miller,"I always pretended for your sake
So you wouldn't know how you made my heart break
I tried so hard to save you from yourself
But I never could cry out loud for help

All I did was help you tell a lie
You never even knew it when I said goodbye
I ran so far and I don't know why

You never even knew who I was
You saw about as far as a blind man does
I carried you with me everywhere I went
I carried everything till my back was bent

All I did was help you tell a lie
You never even knew it when I said goodbye
It keeps on raining and I don't know why

All our words are written down in chalk
Out in the rain on the sidewalk
If all our heartaches were in a stack
They'd go all the way up to heaven and back

We don't know all the trouble we're in
We don't know how to get home again
Jesus come and save us from our sin",Chalk,2009
Buddy & Julie Miller,"I'm drinkin' rain and taking pictures in the dark
With some flowers in my hair and a hole inside my heart
And the hole you left in me is so deep and it's so wide
If you look I think you'll see through right to the other side

Take the stars down that I wished on
Take the stars down from the sky
Take my heart and leave me here but when you go don't say goodbye

I used to wait for trains that never come
I would wait for yesterday but I was waiting for no one
So now I don't look for you to come walking through my door
Those were just the longings of a child who doesn't live here anymore

Take the stars down that I wished on
Take my tears so I don't cry
Take my heart and leave me here but when you go don't say goodbye

So say a prayer for the ones love left behind
Cause a broken heart grown cold is the hardest burden you can find

But it's gonna take a river for all the ones I have cried",Don't Say Goodbye,2009
Buddy & Julie Miller,"Take me back when times were hard but we didn't know it
If we ate it we had to grow it
Take me back when all we could afford was laughter
And two mules instead of a tractor
Take me back again

Take me back where there was nothing left to throw out
There was a light that wouldn't go out
Take me back when we had swollen fingers we'd gotten
When everybody helped pick the cotton
Take me back again

Take me back to places where my memory tarries
Take me back to precious things that my heart carries

Take me back when daddy led the singing on Sunday
Nobody had to plow until Monday
Take me back when I could feel the kiss of my mother
And I had all my sisters and brothers
Take me back again",Ellis County,2009
Buddy & Julie Miller,"Baby we don't know where to go
We can't find anywhere to hide
You can't come in out of the rain when the storm is on the inside

Close the windows and the doors
And take shelter from the sky
But the rain inside still pours every time we say goodbye

Love holds a seed of tragedy
You must lay down your life to live
Seems you become the very thing that you will not forgive

We were children too afraid to look sorrow in the eye
We're just children in the rain every time we say goodbye

Silence is the loudest sound

Baby, baby, you make me make me feel a spark
Yeah I feel a spark and the fire catches
You and me are gasoline and matches

You pull my pin and you trip my wire
You come in and set my heart on fire
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis
You and me are gasoline and matches

Baby, baby, baby, baby, when you make your move
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can feel your groove
The resistance of a strong willed man's in ashes

Like photographs that your heart takes

Please go your way without speaking
Hush, hush sorrow, you are to blame
For all of this pain in my heart

Buddy & Julie Miller,"The night that you left the sky started crying
The moon's face was hiding just like mine
When I was thirsty and lost
Like a true heaven's daughter
Darlin' you brought me water for my soul

There will never be another one for me
I know someday I will see you again
But the love you gave me will last until then

I never thought I'd lose you or that you'd go ahead of me
But now you rode instead of me on their angel wings
Did the lord call your name and did you take his hand
To join that family band once again

And an eclipse of the moon said that you were gone",June,2009

Shinin' for no one, shinin' all in vain
I'm gonna stop wasting my love like this because it's a crime
But it's gonna take a long, long time

Call the doctor when your body hurts
But when the pain is in your soul, hey man nothin' works

Smoke from a cigarette coming underneath my door
Just like your memory sneakin' up on me some more
I'm gonna be all right and leave this heartache behind

Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode

His mama told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people come from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights a sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight
Go go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life

There is no night, there is no day
The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart

I know that you alone can end",There's a Lull In My Life,2014

And you care for me!",Who Cares,2014
Buddy Bergman,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.

You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.

Buddy Blue,"As I passed by
A real fine hotel
A chick walked out
She sure looked swell
I gave her the eye
And started to carry on
When a Cadillac cruised up
And 'swish' she was gone

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
With that real fine chick
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, Cadillac

A little later on
A theater I passed
I spotted another chick
And did she have class
I was all set
To write her name in my book
When her husband came up and gave me a
Real dirty look

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
To have been her chaperone

When I got to the corner
I saw a sharp cat
With a 300 dollar suit on
And a 100 dollar hat
He was standing on the sidewalk
By a DynaFlow
When a voice within said,
""C'mon daddy, let's go.""

With that real fine chick
It should've been me

And I felt OK
At least until I passed
This fine Cafe
I saw a guy eatin'
A great big steak
While a waitress stood by feedin' him
Ice cream and cake

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me

Buddy Blue,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Buddy Bregman,"When you've climbed the highest mountain

Where the earth knows peace with man
When a storm hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend

Where friendships never end
Touched only by the seasons
Swept clean by the waving grain
Surveyed by a happy bluebird

Buddy Bregman & Orchestra,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

You asked me not to call you on the phone

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true.

That's why I seem to have more than my share,

Her only answer is one little smile,

In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one

-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet

Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye

A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,

That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now,2005
Buddy Clark,"Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Yes, miracles can happen,
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel,
That was the night I fell in love.",A Sinner Kissed an Angel,2005

Buddy Cole,"Friends, this is Tex Ritter with a strange story about a soldier boy and
a deck of cards. During a North African campaign a bunch of soldier boys
had been on a long hike, and they arrived in a little town called
Casino.""

The next morning being Sunday several of the boys went to church. A
Sargent commanded the boys in church, and after the Chaplain had read the
prayer the text was taken up next..Those of the boys who had a prayer book
took them out, but this one boy only had a deck of cards, and so he spread
them out.

The Sergeant saw the cards and said,""Soldier, put away those cards.""

After the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall.

The Marshall said, ""Sargent, why have you brought this man here?""

""For playing cards in church, sir.""

""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""

""Much, sir."" replied the soldier.

'The Marshall said, ""I hope so, for if not , I shall punish you more than
any man was ever punished.""

The soldier said, ""Sir , I have been on a march for about six days, and I had neither Bible nor Prayer Book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions.""

With that the boy started his story.

""You see, Sir, when I look at the Ace it reminds me that there is but one God. The deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts; the Old and New Testaments. And when I see the trey I think of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When I see the four I think of the four evangelist who preached the Gospel. There was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And when I see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps. Ten of 'em; five who were wise and were saved; five were foolish and were shut out. And when I see the six it
reminds me that in six days God made this great heaven and earth. And when
I see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from His
great work. When I see the eight I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when he destroyed this earth. There was Noah, his wife,their three sons, and their wives. And when I see the nine I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed , and nine of the ten didn't even thank Him.  When I see the ten I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone. When I see the King it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the queen I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary who is Queen of Heaven. And the jacks, or knaves, it's the devil. And when I count the number of spots on a deck of cards I find three hundred sixty-five the number of days in a year.   Fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year. Four suits, the number of weeks in a month. Twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year.  Thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serve me as a Bible, almanac, and prayer book.""

When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts love sang an old sweet song
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam
Softly it wove itself into our dream

Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go
Though the heart be weary,
Sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's old sweet song.

Even today we hear love's song of yore
Deep in our hearts it dwells forever more
Footsteps may falter, weary grows our way
Still we can hear it at the close of day
So till the end when life's dim shadows fall
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

Sends the snowflakes up in flurries

Folks put runners on their surreys
They forget about their worries
And a man becomes a boy once again

Of a Summer night,

By the garden gate"",

Into a new born day, oh

The vow that all betray

For the passions that thrill love
And lift you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let you fall to hell

Will take it all away",Softly as in a Morning Sunrise,1957

Twine around the door

And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.

Than to be in Carolina

You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender

I've heard collegiates say
I'm not referring to Piccadilly
It's not 42nd Street

It's not the rue de la Paix
Nor is it Market Street in Philly
Ask most any college Romeo
To complete your education you must go....

Down the old ox road
Though you'll never find where it is 
By looking in maps
With a little investigation you'll discover perhaps

That this old tradition's not a place 
But just a proposition called
The old ox road
The old ox road

Ox road could be any romantic spot
A country highway or a moonlit yacht
It could be in the parlor
When the lights are burning low

It could be in the movie 
In the very last row

Down the old ox road
In the magic of the moonlight 
You are filled with delight
While the leaves that flutter o'er you 

Whisper lover tonight
Why keep waiting, and debating
When you know it's time for mating

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot

What are my arms for?

Buddy Cole & His Trio,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty
Wouldst hold my hand

Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me?
Hear me holler I choose
A sweet lollapaloosa in thee

I'd feel so rich
In a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do

Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land

Buddy Cole Trio,"Bill collectors gather 'round and rather
Haunt the cottage next door
Men the grocer and butcher sent
Men who call for the rent
But within a happy chappy
And his bride of only a year
Seem to be so cheerful, here's an earful
Of the chatter you hear

Ev'ry morning, ev'ry evening
Ain't we got fun?
Not much money, Oh, but honey
Ain't we got fun?
The rent's unpaid dear
We haven't a bus
But smiles were made dear
For people like us

In the winter in the Summer
Don't we have fun
Times are bum and getting bummer
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get children
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?

Just to make their trouble nearly double
Something happened last night
To their chimney a gray bird came
Mister Stork is his name
And I'll bet two pins, a pair of twins
Just happened in with the bird
Still they're very gay and merry
Just at dawning I heard

Ev'ry morning, ev'ry evening
Don't we have fun
Twins and cares, dear, come in pairs, dear
Don't we have fun
We've only started
As mommer and pop
Are we downhearted
I'll say that we're not

Landlords mad and getting madder
Ain't we got fun?
Times are so bad and getting badder
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get laid off
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?

When the man who sold 'em carpets told 'em
He would take them away
They said, ""Wonderful, here's our chance
Take them up and we'll dance""
And when burglars came and robbed them
Taking all their silver, they say
Hubby yelled, ""We're famous, for they'll name us
In the peppers today

Night or daytime, it's all playtime
Ain't we got fun?
Hot or cold days, any old days
Ain't we got fun
If Wifey wishes
To go to a play
Don't wash the dishes
Just throw them away

Streetcar seats are awful narrow
Ain't we got fun?
They won't smash up our Pierce Arrow
We ain't got none
They've cut my wages
But my income tax will be so much smaller
When I'm laid off, I'll be paid off

You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,

And oh! If we ever part,
