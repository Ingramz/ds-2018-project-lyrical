Lynnsha,"Vivre sous l'équateur du Brésil
Entre Cuba et Manille
A l'heure d'été c'est facile
Prends-moi la main, viens danser
J'ai du soleil sur la peau
J'ai dans le cœur un bongo
J'ai dans la tête un oiseau
Qui te dit tout haut

Viens danser,
Sous les sunlights des tropiques
L'amour se raconte en musique
On a toute la nuit pour s'aimer
En attendant viens danser
J'aime l'océan pacifique
Ça me fait quelque chose de magique
Y a rein à faire qu'à rêver
Prends-moi la main viens danser

Vivre, entre les vagues et le ciel
Tu ne seras jamais plus belle
Que cette chanson qui t'appelle
Prends-moi la main viens danser
J'ai dessiné sur ta peau
Un palmier au bord de l'eau
Qu'est-ce qu'on est bien, tout est beau
fa mi fa sol do

Viens danser,
Sous les sunlights des tropiques
L'amour se raconte en musique
On a toute la nuit pour s'aimer
En attendant viens danser
J'aime l'océan pacifique
Ça me fait quelque chose de magique
Y a rein à faire qu'à rêver
Prends-moi la main viens danser

Viens danser, viens danser, viens danser,
Ooh, danse, danse, danse, danse, danse
Viens danser, viens danser, viens danser
Sous le sunlight des tropiques
L'amour se raconte en musique
On a toute la nuit pour s'aimer

En attendant, viens danser
J'aime l'océan Pacifique
Ça me fait quelque chose de magique
Y a rien à faire qu'à rêver
Prends-moi la main, viens danser

Lynsey de Paul,"From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

Love bomb, until the time when hate has gone
From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Go up in a cloud of love
Reaching for the Lord above

All we need to live together hand in hand
And understand is simply plant the seed 
And make the world a much better place
Let's all embrace the human race

From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

You and me had better start to clean up the world
And in a while we could be making love
Instead of all the fighting and hate
Why should we wait? It's not too late
Love bomb!

Go up in a cloud of love
Reaching for the Lord above

From now on we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone

From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

A love bomb, a love bomb",Love Bomb,1975

Lynsey de Paul,"And now the band is playing very slow
And once again, I'll get my coat and go
A lonely wallflower waiting by the wall
Without the will power to face the music at all

Please, won't somebody dance with me
Start up a romance with me
Just someone to care
Someone, somewhere for a dance with me

I feel so silly in my patent shoes
So many partners but none of them will choose
A lonely wallflower, growing very tired
Into the small hours and feeling undesired

Please, won't somebody dance with me
Start up a romance with me
Just someone, somewhere
Someone who dares, take a chance with me

for a dance with me

Once I was a tumblin weed
Like a rollin stone, cold and all alone
Living for the day my train would come
I never cared for school or any golden rules
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show them thay was wrong
And headed out on the road singing my song
Then one sunny day. the man, he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real
Money, girls and cars; and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see

When I went home to show em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones

But the ones that I love are in the ground

Gonna be a superstar

Wont you tell me please was I right or wrong

I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine, fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
That's all right, each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Shoots him full of thirty-eight holes

And playin' poker on a losin' night

I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes

Hand guns are made for killin'
They ain't no good for nothin' else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself
So why don't we dump 'em people
To the bottom of the sea
Before some ol' fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you or me

You got a barrel that's blue and cold

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"I was cutting a rug
Down at a place called Jug
With a girl named Linda Lu
When in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who

He said, ""Hey fat fellow
With the hair colored yellow
Watcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you""

I said, ""Excuse""

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean
Big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me

Oh, wait a minute, Mister
I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you

Oh, won't you give me three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
And you'll never see me no more, for sure

Well, the crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four

Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lu
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

Oh, won't you give me three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister

Gimme three steps, Mister
And you'll never see me no more

Lost everything that meant a thing to me

Gonna make you remember for the rest of your life oh baby

We had a good thing a good thing goin'
But ain't been seein' eye to eye
You had a good thing but it's all over
Might as well wave and say goodbye

It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes

I've seen enough

We don't own anything we've got we've givin' it all away
But that don't make no sense to me you know who's gonna pay

Isn't anything in this life sacred anymore
We can't lose what we've got it's worth fightin' for

He don't want your charity he says I ain't no beggar man
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me

Jake is out to get some revenge
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died
Shot down by a so-called friend

Drugs had control of his life
Caught up on crack you're tryin' to think back
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes
It's a killer

There's a cold house at the corner of the street
The kids come and go there at night
Jerry drove up in front of the house
Somebody pulled out a knife
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun
Shot him right between the eyes

These days it's lookin' like a war zone
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives
Money just keeps changin' hands
The laws are gettin' tough sometimes it's not enough

Had to feed my family
Times were hard my hands are still scarred
From the life I've had to lead
I was born to run

Drove a tractor and trailer all my life
Six kids and a hell of a wife
Made lots of money it all slipped away

I always dreamed never gave up
Son, even when times got tough
That's when I'd push it a little bit more

No regrets, I did my best

A lot depends on the luck a man has and the cards that's been dealt to you
I'd fold this hand if I could or at least take a card or two

Had my ups and downs
Tell me does it sound little like you

Good luck -- I'm the last to get it
Bad luck -- I'm the first
When its good, ain't nothin' better
When its bad, ain't nothin' worse

It's either good luck -- I'm the last to get it
Bad luck -- I'm the first
When its good, ain't nothin' better
When its bad, ain't nothin' worse

It's either good luck -- I'm the last to get it
Bad luck -- I'm the first
When its good, ain't nothin' better
When its bad, ain't nothin' worse

And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's ok
Now I'm not trying to put the big apple down

I pick cotton down on the dixie line
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
But that's allright, that's ok by me
'Cause that's the way that it was meant to be

Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

I don't like smoke chokin' up my air
And some of those city folks well they don't care
I don't like cars buzzing around
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine, fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
That's all right, each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone

Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Well, I don't want to even read about it

Let me tell you something, let me tell you true
What's right for me might not be right for you
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine
And I hope that your happy all the time
I pick cotton down on the dixie line
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
But that's all right, that's ok by me
'Cause that's the way that it was supposed to be

Big city, hard times never bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Let me tell ya, I said
Big city, hard times never bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee?

And I caught the first plane home so Papa would see

In my mind he could do no wrong
Misunderstood all along

He worked hard all his life
To get what he has today
We would all be better off, if we could
Hear those words that he had to say

[Chorus]
He was a little rough around the edges
And through it all, we all knew he was
A little rough around the edges
Simple in mind but always had a kind eye for you
(Oh for you, for you)

He took me by the hand
And said son, what's your plan
I won't stop you or stand in your way
Someday you'll be a man

I looked at him with hungry eyes
That only youth can know
With all his wisdom and all his years
He said, I'll teach you all that you need to know

[Chorus]

Don't stop now, keep moving
Don't worry about where you're going, I'll hear you
You'll feel me, I'm there no matter where you go

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"Dig down and tell me what you find
Back in the pages left behind
Everybody's got a story
Ours ain't no different from the rest
Each step we take, it's just a test
On this broken road to glory

When we were young and brave
We fought to save the one thing that we loved
We took the scared vow and signed our names in blood

And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again

There's been a million miles of road
Another million miles to go
Still giving me a reason
Most times your first could be your last
God give me one more second chance
Oh something to believe in
Though it's easier to give it up
Then to give it all you got
Don't let it make you something that you're not

And through it all, we kept on shining
We fought the doubt and faced the pain
We built it up from dust and ashes
To cheat the odds and rise again
And through it all the wheels kept turning
Above the tears the truth stands tall, yeah
Here we are, one in spirit
We stand together through it all
Oh, through it all

When we were young and brave
We fought to save the one thing that we loved

Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in, and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew

Old Curt was a black man
With white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine

Play me a song

Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker

Yes, sir

On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chunked him in the clay
Well, he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose

Play me a song

Your sleeves of satin were hanging by

Yet you would not love me

She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake
The keeper of souls down on Vodoo Lake

There's a city boy across the county line
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine
Well the stories that he heard, well they had to be lies
But he found out different when he looked inher eyes
Well he tried to run away but she had control
He's findin' out now what everybody knows
He knew it was over when she started to shake
Now there's one more soul down on Voodoo Lake

There's an eerie silence at the break of dawn
A chill in the air, something wrong
When a shadow crosses the ground
Those long lost souls never make a sound

Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth
Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth

Till his greed brought him down
He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight
Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown

And every time your faith is shaken

C'mon...

I was raised on the west side Shanty Town
I didn't get up 'til the sun went down
When your backs against the wall you better get tough
I learned real quick how to swing and duck

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)

Hahahaha...
Ooooohhh...

Some folks cheat and some folks lie
I can judge a man by the look in his eyes
So don't hand me Jack and try to call it Cola
I know the difference 'tween shit and shinola

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in the school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)

Play it boys..
MMmmHhmmm...

Mama was no angel when she taught me right from wrong
She knew every single note and every word in every single song
She taught me how to gamble and how to roll the dice
If it makes you feel good DO IT don't think twice

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool

I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine

Like a rolling stone, cold and all alone,

So I left my home to show 'em they was wrong
And headed out on the road singin' my songs.
Then one sunny day, the man, he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real.
Money, girls, and cars; big long cigars.
And I caught the first plane home so Papa would see.
When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones.
Somebody tell me, please, was I right or wrong?

But the ones that I loved were in the ground.

Plus this morning, she told me she woke up throwing up
And I wanna lay, all I'm thinking bout is paper
It might be real early, in the morning when I come home
But best believe I'm coming home, pockets full of do'


Gonna hop up on niggaz, like quizzes in class
Sensei shife niggaz, and chizzle they masks
I ain't your hammer jamming, but I'm packing a glass
When I hit you I'ma split you, like that crack in your ass
Got elbows of weed, I'm bagging my grass
I got weight niggaz, think I need to take out the trash
4 flipping in the dash, one under the seat
Worm just laid the track, to what I done to the beat
Wet niggaz up everywhere, but under the feet
Plus I rock-a-bye niggaz, put 'em under a sheet
I'm trying to get freaky tonight, I'm in the mood
For a baby-faced girl, with a big girl mule
Jeans on the couch, underwear in the pool
Closer boys keep girls, square in the nude
A layer, the Earth's my turf so I'm a grown
When I'm finished with these streets, I'm gone into hiding

Pull it all night, as on the block stacking bread
Ducking police, and I'm stacking big heads
Never letting it go FED, while I grind it out
Shooting dice on my knees, making boys drop out
Got it popped at the spot, and a twat that's wide
I dig up between thighs, when they qualified
Naked showing hide, cotton up six figgas
Day for day on the block, watching thangs get bigger
Build an empire, the boss of the street game
Stack it up real pretty, I'm sicking all my change
Fame is a trip, people can back stab you
Gotta watch your back, cause somebody could grab you
Stay on no cases, and counting the big faces
They'll be working for your vote, in all kinda places
The glock stay crunk, and lit up at all times
But it make it heavy, that's why I'm getting mine",Fire,2004

I couldn't go on without you

You know there comes a time in everybody's life when
we just need a little bit of guidance
You know we get a little lost in the fog
and it sort of impedes our vision
But there's a way that we can figure it all out
and make it happen, make it work

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to mute all the roof hogs
Let's build, useful tools, find some resolution in our lives
Three's to get your groove on, but it ain't like there's no
particular order, this ain't a true/false, answer only part of it
Everything's got an art to it
So we bottle it, market it, it don't hold water
well then we sharpen it, carve a little niche where we can all exist
as ourselves, not our sales
Despite our ails (OOH DO TELL!)
Cause I can't part with the alcohol, no doubt bruh
And on that note, I'm like my Southpaw Grandpah
He used to get his lamp on, he used to giggle at Tampons
And I'm probably not supposed to talk about that part
who cares though that's not important
I really broke all the sample laws with this damn song
so now I'm an outlaw
But it's time, we started talkin havin dialogue and bein honest
What's the other options - walk around, bottled up all hot and bothered
Makin assumptions and nothin gets accomplished
Can we set it off properly please?

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to glue all the loopholes
Music is fuel, to get us where we goin in our lives
Three is still to groove on, but it ain't like there's a
paricular void, that's true though, that's my whole argument
That's where I'm at, there's where I've always been
Cause we've made accomplishments, we just need to proceed
with the utmost confidence - so, whether that encompasses you
signing up with your community nautilus
Buy a couple joggin suits, hop up on that pommel horse
and burn some ounces off your gluts, your upper abdominals
Openin offices, in major metropolises
Get some flossy cards, your logo embossed on em
Not the cost effective models
where you gotta cross the old pager number off the bottom
and draw, all kinds of lines all across it
and write your mom's spot, on top, and along the side of em
like, ""Aww man, my pencil's not sharp -- know what?
Let me, let me just get your card, tight
Also, is it possible, can you run me by a Jack in the Box?""
Like I should, open office, minimize losses
Reinvest profits, we refine the process
by readin all the options, keepin all we promised
So we not caught up, all the fellas with the pants down
ladies caught topless, showin they casabas
Ignore that garbage, that was just some old nonsense
Strictly off the top shit, measurin the progress
The heart has the yardstick, anything else? Uhh yes..

Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

Close relations past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator

Lyrics Born,"This is hard for me to write it's difficult to express this
Its heavy on my shoulders and the weight gets relentless
The story of brothers and a beautiful friendship
And how relations get strained with pressure and tension
Who's wrong, correct, so, so, subjective
You look back its hard 'cause the mind gets adventurous
Dates get mixed up facts disconnected
The only thing you remember is the feeling that you're left with
It started as a blessing

Now you could write this off as luck or one of life's coincidences
But at some point you think god damn what are the chances
People with similar interests and influences
Coming together at that moment to form a kinship
It's like you knew that you was brothers before your conception
Even if you're not a spiritual person I admit shit
At that point I wasn't but at some point it sets in
It be foolish to dismiss this as coincidence
Now this shit is different, somewhere this is written
Be part of a mission, this shit is predestined
Closer than close like flesh is to tendon
Share my 50 cent bag of chips with my freshman
Half a half a gas station sandwich no question
Talking shit to me well then talking shit to him then
Family is sacred it must be protected
Family is sacred and it must be protected

Over time I don't know what happens something got infected
People grow in different ways at different rates I guess
It ridiculous, little shit it suddenly gets big shit
Lapses in communication, glitches in the system
He said that she said what nobody said shit
But you'll never know 'cause everyone's passive aggressive
I sit down smoke pow wow how everyone said shit
People cease to make the effort to get to the essence
Peep this shit out though this shit is really twisted
Funny thing is that you and I do it every minute
We take it in rhetoric every time somebody says shit
Against us stock piling every little incident
What's stupid is all the bullshit that's circulating
Could be fixed in an instant with simple conversation
But you know how pride is
A bitch with her fist clenched
That mixed with the fat drama gets addictive
Wounds need dressing and they don't receive attention
It snowballs and festers and creates resentment
People demonise each other brave discontent
But nobody could've been prepared for the next step
The nature of the predator is calculated pensive
Waiting in the brush patiently revving they engines
Despite the colour that they got all they see is crimson
Waiting for they prey to become desperate defenceless
Outside is always over just beyond the fences
Today the gate is open though today they make an entrance
Friendly at first laughs jokes like we best friends
Slowly though you start to see they become hidden agendas
Nine to five one day insecure self perceptions
Shines a spotlight on all those paranoid self perceptions
Things begin to heat up everyone's already stretched thin
How could you be well how could you be so deceptive
Any second now someone will snap like a bread stick
And what once was simply dissolves like a breath mint
Just like that you start to ask yourself questions
Is this really worth all the emotion and depressment
Do the benefits and perks outweigh the pressure
Let me step back give this relationship assessment",Before And After,2003

But you won't defeat no contest baby

Forfeit don't rock the call pit???
Chalk this up as a conquest
Some things is sacred
I don't play with my stage or my audience

Smooth talking charismatic ass ill
Talk you lady outta bra
Honda hatchback hand held y'all starved
And I'm dangling a shrimp by the fan tail
Whole audience about to fall over the handrail
I can't tell is that rapping?
Dude sound like a fucking parrot just crash landed
Man this shit is ass backwards these days real crazy
I can count on one hand cats that's truly creative
And the rest is all get along go along guys
Happy not to get involved just along for the ride
No vision, no drive, spirit or wherewithal
You can get mad and stay mad at that I don't care at all
Huge parafoils keep em cool under a parasol
Paragon of my era like sarah born?
How many different kinda tracks have y'all heard me on
Exactly and I served them all

[Chorus]

I spent ten years in these god forsaken rap trenches
With small daily victories this shits a game of inches
I sustained minor injuries scuffles with the missus
For the chance to make history I don't regret it for a minute
Seeing cats drop a small fortune on plush ride blau?
Couple years later fools is upside down
Tell me what the fuck did you get in this game for
It's like a whole world of squirrels only one acorn
I don't usually like to take it back
But  realistically if this was a different era
y'all would fail miserably
Ghetto team I'm going in, take me down fifty feet
I never let this industry put me in the guillotine
Rapelle down the skyscraper kicking in the plexiglass
Plastique on the safe boom blown to Leningrad
Stuff the cash and the formula in the fifty bag
Slide down the rope, twenty stories hail a taxi cab

[Chorus]",Pack Up,2003
Lyrics Born,"Stop complaining
Stop complaining

Now many songs do you figure that I've written
Since I originally started making records in this business
Back beginning in college, and it's been a menace since then
But the principal challenge, it ain't really that different
It's about me not repeating myself at all
Or at least repeating myself the least amount, I suppose
The reason being is that we need some songs
That lead us off the beaten path between my rhymes
But listen though, it's difficult now a-days
To really go against the grain, get you some accolades
Especially with these frigid, finicky, fickle-ass motherfuckers
Think they finally figured you out, the fake-ass fuckers

Stop complaining (I know, it's just that certain shit pisses me off)
Stop complaining (What am I gonna do? I mean)

Man, fuck that shit, I pay my taxes when I'm asked to
I'm not enthusiastic about it, but shit I make it happen
Yeah,  it's last minute, but goddammit they cash it
""This is fiscal harassment! They keep touching my assets!""
Now I imagine I might be feeling different about it
If it was given outright, witnessing it helping somebody
But it just so happens in life, the school district's too crowded
There ain't no teachers in sight, that's why the kids are so rowdy
I just imagine some asshole with glasses on up at the capital
One of a thousand pawns packed in an office, cramped up like animals
Pictures of his sister, his mixture Lhasa Apso poodle
His 2.6 kids and the missus thumb-tacked to his cubicle
So damned detached from the average man's planet he can't fathom
That he can ever be anything other than stats, fat and taxable
He's getting his usual, ritual 2 o'clock cup of noodles on
Fucking you with your W-2, with his John Denver music on

""Hey..um.oooh, I love this one. Hey Lil? Can you get me the file on.?""
""Blah blah blah blah blah?""
""Yeah..he's making too much money""

Stop complaining (I know, Ladies.it's just)
Stop complaining (I'm trying, I'm really trying)
Stop complaining (Yeah I know, lets give it. )
Stop complaining (I wonder what do they say about me?)

Is he a role model we can all follow full throttle
So we don't bother having to create our own model
That we go by? A fall guy I can hold accountable?
'cause I don't want to hold the bottle for my own child
Is it really my place to raise little Billy
when Hilly and William should be building with him in the living room
Instead of bailing on him, and alienating him, and basically failing him
Sending him sailing on a mission to oblivion?
Then, inevitably on his day in court and Billy ain't to blame
The bailiff asks him to raise his arm and say his name in court
Of course his parents ain't in court, they play it off
Saying it ain't his fault
Blame it on Asian Born, or his favorite artist
Beg your pardon?
Now, I do admit that in the music business
people do and say some really stupid shit
Kids are zooming in and using what we do and say
I can see how you can say ""do not abuse your influence""
But to all the Hillaries and the Williams of the new millennium
If you really aren't feeling like living with the children will be a fulfilling experience
Or something you envision yourself willingly
and unconditionally committed to from the beginning
Maybe you shouldn't be bumping bellies from the giddyup anyway, dummy

Stop complaining (Well, for now)
Stop complaining (Man, YOU stop complaining)
Stop complaining
Stop complaining (Whatever)",Stop Complaining,2003

His name is (Lyrics Born)
And he is, as they say, wild and crazy
As a composer, arranger, and producer
He's exploring it all
From the furthest reaches of musical outer space
To the most down to earth funk
And he sounds, well, he sounds exactly like this

[Verse 1]
Nobody 'members those
Rap City episodes from twenty years ago
When you were the guest host
Past history, let it go
Get off on a medical
Pack a duffle bag with all your wrinkled clothes and pedal home
Get a little dictaphone and sit alone
In the middle of the room and let it flow
Wouldn't it be better
If you went and chose a new career path
Like a shepherd or a flight attendant on an aircraft?
You're pitiful, a pollywog
Tiny fishy in a smaller pond
Holding barbie dolls and leftover beads from the Mardi Gras
Actin hella hard but that's just poppycock
'Cause inside you're hella soft like a Jolly Rancher lollypop
I'll give you cauliflower ears stupid
You're weird
Feelin blue
On a stool somewhere, two-fisting beers
At a Hofbrau
Moaning like a hot cow
Cryin on the shoulder of some old man you met just now

[Chorus]
I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

[Verse 2]
Look I'm sorry, mate
This is awkward, k?
Little hard to say
So I'll just say it
Me and your mommy date
She's awfully great
She's a soft seatmate
She calls me late
Always wants to meet
On her coffee breaks
She bought me seats
To Bonnie Raitt
Now there's no concrete date
But she bought the ring
It's Marjorie May
And my stockings stink
From my foot up in your ass
'Cause you drive me absolutely batty
See I'm crabby when you get around me
Tell me who's your daddy
Call me Mister McAffee, your poop-deck pappy
Shut your trap and get back in the backseat of the Camry
Don't sass me or I'll backhand you
Smack you with an axe-handle
Burn you with a wax candle
Slap you with a sandle
I'm trying to watch the rap channel
Can't you tell we laugh about you?
Call yourself a rapper but I gives a rat's ass about you

[Verse 3]
Why do I even bother with these Hoff-brand cats
Y'all are wombats man
I'm bout to blow this pop stand
Lyrically y'all don't compare to me in any contest
Like a stealth bomber up against a Hyundai Accent
Tall-can to a shot glass
Bong-hit to a contact
Gary Coleman versus Big Boss Man
The Loch Ness Monster up against a crawdad
Talking Sly Stallone in Rocky versus Sly Stallone in Copland
Judge Judy versus Johnny Cohcran
Oh man
Nell Carter versus Karen Carpenter topless
Better yet, Broadband
Compared to a long ass
Piece of string connecting two pop cans
It's all bad
Don't quit your job at all believe me you'll be so glad back
Hold on with both hands
It's sucks washing sauce pans
I know there's an off chance that one day hip-hop heads
Will maybe feel rappers in the top-ten that crossdress

Blowin' minds wit' these lyrics out my fact-oray

Show you all how a funky record has to be 
Not to toot my horn, I'm from Californ 
It's the +cheese+, not the kind that's grown from cows in barns 
But the kind that meets your needs in like a thousand forms 
As we dance to the ever flowin' masquerade 
Homey, pass the J, homies pass away 
Over pride when another nigga blast a K 
Evil thought hearts chilly, Dickie Dastard-lay 
All his people mourned deeply as the pastor prayed 
Come though from out of town, you wouldn't last a day 
All they know is long money and assassination 
Get it now, not tomorrow, don't procrastinate 
This is my grind, verbal slangin', I'm a master fate 
In a drastic way, this is class so pay 
Close attention, write all night 'til I gasp and faint 
Get my people out this struggle of that Section 8 
If you want it, hey we got it, you don't have to wait because...

Shine my light to dim, all the spite within 
Competition, 'cause at times, I know we frighten them 
All we really wanna do is give some sight to them 
All my people, New York City to the coast of Cal 
I'm the toast of towns, I'm the cat's meow 
Movin' faster than your mind, come and catch me now 
Niggaz see me on stage and wanna ask me out 
I'm the true original never a hand-me-down

Lyrics Born,"Ayo Kane found Logan lamping at Deluca's
Sitting with a little black boy, she called him Lucas, he knew it
Found himself the daughter of a kingpin
The ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win
His seed, the grief filled up in his eyes
He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!
M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
This is just the fuckin tip of the storm!
Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!
As soon as he step in the building
AMBUSH!

At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate
Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]
The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place
He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench 
of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths
No light or water, arms and legs bound

But there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
I'm ready to get involved with the revolving [?] warehouse all by myself
I dive underground finding rounds

Ran away from my life, to be a rock star

And packed in my suitcase, dreams are getting old
I’ve been up and down town, on this broken road

Under the spotlight, of the streetlights
That wait for me to shine 
Over the moonlight, it feels so right
I’m poetry in motion
It’s part of my devotion
I play with all emotion 
Under the spotlight, of the streetlights

So make a wish and throw, a dime in my hat
You’ll hear songs a new way, from this here cool cat
My heart and my music, I wear on my sleeve
I have crowds gathering, like you won’t believe
My skin’s gotten thicker, my hair may recede
My guitar and music, they’re all that I need

Running after my own dreams
Tripping over my own feet
Held on to my self esteem
Walking to my own loud beat
So stand tall or take a seat

Under the spotlight, of the streetlights
That wait for me to shine

It’s never the end, but just a brand new start
Taking the short road, isn’t always so smart
Dream up destiny, and it will come alive
Happiness will come, soon after the long strife

You grow up, you grow old
Life it can seems so cold 
You shine bright, in the night 
Like a star, lit so bright
It’s your story right now
Say it loud, say it proud
It’s your glory right now
So stand up, take a bow",Your Story,2014
Lyrics of Two,"Who’d think our road would be so long when we started this ride together
Facing every storm by standing strong for worse or for better
Making memories with every passing day that will last us a lifetime
And even in the darkest of days your love makes me shine
Now under the summer moons sky lost in the sparkle in your eyes
So many things I want to say to you but no words would ever do 
Here in this moment

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
I have a million ways to say how I feel for you
But sometimes words they just won’t do
I just want to love you, I just want to love you

Said good bye to my lonely days when you walked in to my life
Promise to give you all the love it takes to keep you by my side
Tender moments with you are more precious than words can say
I want to let this perfect night take us away

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
I have a million ways to say how I feel for you
Not a single word can say what love can do
I just want to love you, I just want to love you

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
With a million ways that I can say how i feel you
I don’t want to say a single word I just want to love you",I Just Want To Love You,2015
Lyrics of Two,"Over the city, under the Hollywood sign
City lights are flickering, like a million fireflies 
He turns up the radio and says to me 
Remember this old melody?
Hot Cali sunshine, radiating late June
Driving up the coastline, top down, me and you
Seashells, sand angels, taking in the sunset
Baby I’m dreaming of when we first met

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving

Then we hiked up the Canyon on a warm starry night 
Spent the whole time dancing under the moon light
With the beat of the city underneath our feet 
And the feelings in our heart that still repeat
Hot Cali sunshine, radiating late June
Driving up the coastline, top down, me and you
Seashells, sand angels, taking in the sunset
Baby I’m dreaming of when we first met

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving

Nothing has changed your still by my side
Taking in the moments under Hollywood lights
Fireflies, moonlight, dancing until midnight
Baby I’m so happy you’re mine, baby I’m so happy you’re mine

Lyrics of Two,"There’s only one earth, and one glorious sky
One fleeting time, quickly passing us by
To put our differences aside, and make everything alright
For our one human race
No matter what tongue, creed , color or faith

Same heart and soul, no matter where in the world
So in this one world, we got one chance, under this one sky
Lets come together for all mankind

Lyrics of Two,"Life lost it’s spark in the everyday traffic
We had to get away to bring back the magic
Packed foot flops, summer tops
Sunscreen and cutoffs 
And we headed right on down, to this laid back little beach town
Warm winds blowing, ocean waves flowing
Just you and me baby cabana bound 
Nothing on our minds but laying out
Chillin’ to the rhythm, the audio
To that sweet summer jam on the radio

Lets go, let go of the worries 
(No plans) no plans and no hurries
Get lost in the harmony 
Wrapped up in the melody

Relaxed, laid back

Don’t need any excuse
For all this letting loose
Baby, (hey, hey) 
 
Night jumping in, sun fading out 
But the heat is on a slow roll down
Soft and steady like the moonlight,
No rushing anywhere tonight
A serenade of stars fill the sky
Yeah we never seen them quite so bright
Slow kisses ‘neath an old palm swaying in the breeze
To the rhythm, the beat, the harmony
Of that summer song playing for you and me

Life is a mystery, it’s a roll of the dice

Only thing we can count on is the sunset and sunrise
(Hey, hey)
But there is no better view, then to see them with our own eyes

Lyricson,"BLESS THE YOUTHS		
 
Rastafari bless the youths as long as they live
Keep them on the right track far from envy and greed
Teach them how to help each other so they could achieve
Hail up the Most High he shall bless your seeds 	
 
Jah you blessed me all my life
Provide your care for my kids and wife
Always showed me wrong from right
Set my feet on higher heights
I’ve got to give thanks all my days
‘Cause Jah you helped me ease the pain
Through these trouble times I face
Jah you wash my tears away
 
CHORUS (Bis)

Never surrender, never retreat
Even when the road gets steep
Always keep your goals in sight and some day you shall achieve
Though some try to keep you down through they don’t want to see you reach
Remember Jah is by your side so you shall never get defeat
The system keeps pressuring the poor man and the meek 
So much hungry belly pickneys, so much homeless in the streets
Though we try our best it’s so hard to make ends meet
Still we got to stand strong can’t afford to be weak
(Bridge)
I know that things and time shall change
So never lose confidence within yourself

CHORUS (Bis)

Why dutty Babylon want see the ghetto youths stalling
Nothing could stop the ghetto youths from rising
They try to hold us down make us turn to crime and violence 
But we’re not going to stray because the Most High give us guidance
I tell the ghetto youths to live up right
Stop with the war all of the fuss and fight
Cause this a time when we all should unite and give Babylon a surprise

Love is the answer. Love is the way.
Love makes us stronger so show love I say.

 The people want some peace of mind tired of living in fear.
Love it’s what it’s all about keep it in your heart, never let it part. 
Love keeps you solid as a rock, shinning through the dark
Spread it all about.
Love is worth much more than silver and gold
Keep it in your heart and your soul.

We shall rise step towards your goals don’t you be afraid

In this time I say to stop fight yourself

Because we’ve got so much works to do and so much seeds to plant
Only way to achieve it is to do it hand in hand
See the ghetto people them they have been suffering for too long
They say they’re tired of the pressure they want better days to come
It’s not easy to bare the life down in the slum
When you don’t even know when your next meal is going to come
When gunshots echo in the air like drums
Bills and Taxes increase and you have no income
Still you got to keep the faith yes you got to hold on
Never worry yourself just keep the faith and be strong
The love of Rastafari guides and keeps you all along
Jah protect us through the cold and through the storm

CHORUS

I’m done telling the ghetto youths that unity is strength
So let’s come together burn the crime and violence
Elevate your mind free up your conscience
Give thanks to Rastafari for his care and guidance
And never let the system come treat you like a fool
They will use and abuse you then will kick you like mule
And never let no one take you for no footstool
Just live your life clean and follow the golden rule
The Most High keep me safe from those who try to get me down
And he set my feet upon a solid ground
Jah Jah, keep me safe from those vipers around
That’s why I give thanks and praises to the Man who wears the Crown

Every time I drop they copping, every single line I lay is locking
You a hater, boy, stop your plotting, it'll be your blood we mopping
Talk about that major flavor, keyed up, cut like a razor
Lyrically I stake and bake ya, you can see I get that paper
Wear jet black like Darth Vader, hopping out on playa haters

Switch it up, hit it up, get it up, let it up
Your girl from the back, like giddy up
How come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up
Inside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up
Think about that while you doubt that, you a fake mac, you can't count that
Hop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback
I'm from where them GOAT GOAT, shout that
Ask Master P, I'm bout that

Rock and rolling, competition catching coals in they colon

Stop by in the summer
Do you remember?
Do you remember
When we met, last summer?
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer

I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie & Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer

Hip-hop mama, spic n span
Met you one summer
And it all began
You're the best girl
That I ever did see
The great Larry Byrd, jersey 33
When you take a sip
You buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote
A whole bunch of sonnets
Call me when you miss me
'Cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes
Really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you
And it makes me mad
You left one day
And never came back
Stayed all summer
Then went back home
Macualay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love but
Now we ain't speaking
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you
I saw my name is Rich
You look like a girl

Cherry pants Coke
Crushed rocks till I boogie
Used to hate school
So I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the be	-ball style
Known to act wild and
Make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you
Because you rock my world
You come from Georgia
Where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade
And speak real slow
You love hip-hop
And rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when
You were four years old
There was a good man
Named Paul Revere
I feel much better baby
When you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh
When I tell a joke
When I met you
I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl

Are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like
I stole your bike

Bugalute shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back
There oh-so quick
Let you off the hook
Like my man Mr. Limpit
Think about that summer
And I bug 'cause I miss it
Like the color purple
Macaroni and cheese
Ruby-red slippers
And a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon
But I hate Footloose
Came in the door
I said it before
Think I'm over you

LFO you're on
I was at a party with my mind in the gutter
She walked in behind me with her friend and her brother
Stepped onto the dance floor shakin' her hips
I thought I might bust when she licked her lips 
Sometimes I wish I was someone like Brad Pitt
She'd walk right over to me and then say 
""Hey we should split"" 
Sometimes I wish I had a girlie that looked that fine 
Not thinking 'bout forever, just six minutes of her time

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's got me on my knees
Five minutes and she's got me beggin' please
Another minute and she shows me somethin' new
I need six minutes with you, six minutes

I was at work with my mind in the gutter
She was in a magazine her face on the cover
Lying in a room that was lit by a candle 
That's the type of girl
That I wish that I could handle

'Cause in a crowded room would I be the one she would choose?
Sometimes I wish a girl like that could be mine

Lyte Funky Ones,"Saw her on a Friday outside someones dance saloon
She was crying over someone that she felt love much too soon
I said: ""Hey girl don't you cry tonight, let me take you out on this town""
She looked at me and smiled as one last tear splashed of the ground
With half a wink she asked me ""What are you some kind of creep?""
I told her ""No I guess I just feel your vibe is kinda deep""
The moon hung over Soho and I counted 16 stars
I pointed at the brightest one and said ""Now that one's ours""

She's a dandelion up on her hill, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, hold on hold on hold on

I just might be poison but he took me to his roof top
He said ""Are you affraid of hights?"" I said ""No I am not""
He said ""Hey girl don't you lie to me, tell me everythin you feel""
We danced around in circles, he said ""I think we felt somethin real""

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on

Down in Union Square I saw her walking all alone
I walked a little slower just so I remain unknown
She met someone on 17 think she knew him all to well
My little piece of heaven has a secret she won't tell
Without the smile she took his hand and then they walked away
I realised I wouldn't see my girl after today
I fell in love with a dandelion and she's all I ever had
At first she looked so sweet but in the end she tastes so bad

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on
And I tell myself hold on hold on hold on, and hold on hold on hold on

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be

I'm twenty-seven years old and Brownsville raised
Upset with all the blood, the sweat, and the tears

[M.O.P.]
Baby its on, a mother shed tears, at the same time, a baby is born
On the other side of town, a life is lost
A young thug was knocked off, and the heat was tossed
Damn, life is real, and so tragic
But don't stop now, live your life, I know its hell for the rough,
But don't talk down on ya man, unless you helpiin' him out
ITS YOURS!

I think of you since you've been gone
And every night before I wake
Dream of days gone by to mend my heartbreak

The sun still shines, the moon still glows
Can't someone tell me where did my love go
The world still turns, I still believe
She's somewhere out there lookin' down on me

Your so happy babe, I'm missing you like crazy
You were the one that is realized right by my side forever
Still hear our favorite song, tears fall as I sing along
I don't know if I can make it without you my hearts still achin'

They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.

They're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living 
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever,

What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot

What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal?
You telling me if we couldn't shoot a ball
Our lives still got shooting involved?
And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?
But fuck it this is life
Deal with it or get dealt with
I'm in my room smoking alone like I'm selfish
Cause' some days the sun's hard to face
Dad turns his son wears his face

But look closer see the heart of a lion
Sticks and stones couldn't damage my bones harder then iron

Would the people I used to be friends with never left?
What if making a name didn't come with regrets?

The misunderstood are always dead before 'they' understand
Staring at ceiling fans, chop up milligrams, draw a pentagram
Lucifer's not a rumor he's in the band, (damn)
Liquor and vomit on my Converse
Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser
Are plastic orange bottles of peer pressure
And I'm ready to cave, I live in a cage
How can I be a hero when I'm the one needing saved
Forty-eight hour days of this fast lane living
Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out then fade away is what Kurt said
I felt the same until I saw his daughter and thought as a father
What if tomorrow, the only I could spoil her was dying?

We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour and they want to tell you a little story
about where they come from

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

You love to hear the story again and again 
of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me 
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn 
Out
By any place any part of the world

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine
And i'm from

Lent symphonies, left a crystal rock I copped at tiffany's

I scraped the well

M,"I packed my bags the first thing this morning.
I packed all my changes in there too.
Erased all the numbers and addresses,
And all the memories of you.

[Chorus]
Because I don't care about you anymore.
Because I don't think about you anymore.
Because I don't call about you anymore.
Because I don't dream about you anymore.
I won't cry about you anymore.
I won't laugh about you anymore.
I don't ask about you anymore.
I don't care about you anymore.

When I catch myself from crying,
I stare so far into my soul,
But all along I get a feeling;
How something wrong can take its toll.

If it doesn't kill us, well, I guess it makes us stronger.
But my strength is aching as my eyes just drift away.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Live it as you'd live a dream.
Aim so high.

Just keep the flame of truth burning bright.
The missing treasure you must find
Because you and only you alone
Can build a bridge across the stream.

Weave your spell in life's rich tapestry -
Your passport to feel supreme.

You've go to search for the hero inside yourself,
Search for the secrets you hide.
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life.

Search inside yourself. (you've got to search)
Search inside yourself. (you've got to search)

Search for the secrets you hide.

Until you find the key to your life.

But love is in my soul, love is in my soul.

The tension grows and clouds your eyes.
The swim upstreams, the bridge of sighs.
The cold stone walls and the metal jam.
The ugly roar from a dying man.
All these things that bring you down
mean nothing more than a laughing clown.
If you lift up your soul be strong be proud,
you'll never be just another face in the crowd.

M People,"It's called dull life and it's showing at a town near you.
It's called real life, believe me every word I say is true.
Life's not cheap you know so priceless next to death,
live it while you can, live it every breath.
Straight lines. Black and white. A silent exhibition.
You don't have to be a prisoner of your own ambition.

Melody of life. We got a melody of life.
We are children of life in a reservoir of dreams.
We are counting on the night when nothing is quite what it seems.
They'll inspire your arrogance with a lack of thought.
Weilding power is a trick, so easy to be bought.
Nothing is too far away nothing's out of reach.
Look the world straight in the eyes. Stand on your own feet.

Melody of life. Symphony of love.
We got a melody of life. Symphony of love.

I looked at your stars and ooh I saw the Milky Way

You are my life my night and day

Just too much love for me to hide

You just have to be there It feels so right

I wake up alone and everything is cold and grey
You walk in a room and brighten up a cloudy day
Friends will arrive then they disappear
But if you want me baby honey I'll be here

Then came the moment when I lost my will
I prayed for mercy please don't take me away

I've been lonely, I've been cheated, and I've been misunderstood
I've been washed up, I've been put down, and told I'm no good
But with you I belong 
Because you helped me be strong 
There's been a change in my life since you came along

Now I don't mind working hard every day
And I don't pay no mind to what people say 
'Cause after all the pain I've been through
I gave up everything to love only you
See, all my life I've walked with my head bent in shame
But since I found you, with you I've been made

And the heart gets a little weary when it doesn't belong
And the road gets a little bit rocky but you've got to keep on
And let the new light shining on you

Can you hear it (I hear it in my heart)
Can you feel it (well I can feel the power around me)

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Where the universe revolves around the pupil of an eye
And infinities stretch out from infinities within
And I'm a part of everything, I'm a part of everything

Am I falling asleep? Is it all just a dream?
Well, the cars are like water and the road is like a stream
Rolling down through the city, flowing out into the sea
Going nowhere like me, going nowhere like me

When the morning starts to glow out in the corners of the sky
All the people come and go, and the time just passes by
Then I'm only gonna see it from the corner of my eye
When the planet spins, it sings like the wings of a dragonfly

All tangled up in dandelion hair and polka dots
And a picture book mind full of dreams and designs
And visions of faraway places

Yeah, she drew underwater worlds and cities in the stars
In the Asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars
In felt tips and crayons her little works of art
All promised a future of greatness

She caught the sunlight in her eye
Underneath the winter sky
""I'll paint the world until I die"", she said
""One day I'll spread my wings and fly high like a snowbird""

Yes, I will

Her daddy died when she was only ten
But all she cried came out in ink and in pen
She drew charcoal streets leading down to dead ends
Where heads hung low in sorrow

But she was left a small fortune at the reading of the will
About enough for a life and then another life still
And with her mother in a haze of vodka and pills
Snowbird had just dreamed of tomorrow

She caught the sunlight in her eye
Underneath the winter sky
""I'll paint the world until I die"", she said
""One day I'll spread my wings and fly high like a snowbird""

Yes, I will
That's right

Years went by and she hit eighteen
And left home for the art-school scene
To paint the people of the shadows and the faces unseen
For her hero was now Egon Schiele

But she did a couple of little canvases and bad super 8
And a conceptual piece that was thirty years too late
It was all she could fit between the dinner and the dates
With dreamers and drummers and dealers

She caught the sunlight in her eye
Underneath the winter sky
""I'll paint the world until I die"", and she said
""One day I'll spread my wings and fly high like a snowbird""

Yes, I will

Well, who's that girl in the little black dress?
Her head held high like a real princess
A glimmering, shimmering, coked up mess
A fashion trash, art school failure

Yeah, her fingernails are all there's left to paint in her world
She dishes out the dirt with the party powder girls
Who think love comes in diamonds and wisdom in pearls
And art is just paraphernalia

She's lost the sunlight from her eye
There's only a mirror ball left in her sky
""I'll do what I want till the day that I die
Now see me spread my wings, I can fly high like a snowbird

M. Donald,"One, two, three

I started out a long, long, long time ago
But my journey held most things I did not know
But I was sure and believed the plan You gave
Was so secure inside of me

In latter days I found failure down
And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep the love, that I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down
I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around
Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward
And the battle starts all over again

Now when I need to know for sure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Sometimes in this world, challenges come
And emotions get carried away
But in faith be strong and to His word hold on
And when if doubt comes, guard up yourself
Stand there and say I remember

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes I gotta remember, oh yeah
That you called me, Lord
Yes, you did and I'm at your disposal

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes, gotta remind myself
That you called me, called me
And I'm at your disposal

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Sometimes gotta remind myself
Sometimes gotta remind myself
Sometimes gotta remind myself
That you called me, called me
And I'm at your disposal

M. Doughty,"The trouble is a single atom
Shot at random random fire
Two particles fused and coupled
Once united multiply
The waves run underground
Electric power copper wire

Some tiny evil bursts the surface
Lays quiet like insecticide
Slanted, the eyes 
And this bonds mind to mind
The risk is mine
And this bonds mind to mind
She says a word across the ocean

I hear the spit I hear the sigh
The wavelength undivided
To drain the fruit 
And leave the rind the shot runs
Through her wiring through her curve
Through her spine to feel an impulse
Rising rising a mess 
Of reason and kissing eyes",Bond,1996

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,

No tears, no fuss,

There is nothing for me but to love you,

Travaillant dans le faubourg.
Il y avait une fille qui rêvait simplement
En attendant l'amour.
Il y avait le printemps,
Le printemps des romans
Qui passait en chantant
Et cherchait deux cœurs troublants
Pour prêter ses serments
Et en faire des amants.

Il y a eu un moment merveilleux,
Lorsque leurs regards se sont unis.
Il y a eu ces instants délicieux
Où, sans rien dire, ils se son compris.
Il y a eu le destin
Qui a poussé le gamin
A lui prendre la main.
Il y a eu la chaleur,
La chaleur du bonheur
Qui leur montait au cœur.

Aux fenêtres donnant sur la cour.
Il y avait ce couple qui s'aimait
Et leurs phrases parlaient de toujours.

Qui promenait sa main
Dans les cheveux de lin
De la fille aux yeux rêveurs
Tandis que dans leur cœur
S'installait le bonheur.

Il y a eu ces deux corps éperdus
De bonheur, de joies sans pareils.
Il y a eu tous les rêves perdus
Qui remplaçaient leurs nuits sans sommeil.
Il y a eu le moment
Où, soudain, le printemps
A repris ses serments.

M. Lambert,"Going down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been, we're going down
Going down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been

Growing up I needed a guide like, a blind veteran's dog,
Cause I was going nowhere like a child's letters to god,
Though life's road was hard I was never so lost,
That I looked for an answer in a medicine box,
I never did pop pills, or cop deals, just rocked hills
Kids with skills, still got harassed by the cops till,
They'd have me in the back of a paddy, down to lock up,
Smack me, pat me down for a baggy, mums would rock up,

And bail me out, a failure out once again,
Next weekend, bailed me out, drunk again,
And I never will forgive myself, for putting you through all that hell,

I went from high school dropout to factory laborer,
Slave to the clock until four, went from sleeping on the floor,
To being back on tour, now no stopping me,
I'll finish with a bang like Kurt Cobain's biography

[Chorus]
Going down the hard road, down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been, and don't know where to go its like,
Going down the hard road, down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been

I spent my youth like life was cheap,
The only change that I wanted was enough to buy a drink,
Was on a path nowhere, the harder the road,
The more broken baggage we carry the larger the load,
This school drop-out got knocked out, chased by the cops out,
Got clout, dumped by my girlfriend and locked out,
Been broke and beaten, even chocked at being,
A dope MC but never lost hope in dreaming,

We used to thrash boosted cars till the engine would fail,
If I never had bailed I'd be dead or in jail,
And man I got no one else to blame
I thank my family and music for keeping me sane,

But that's the breaks right? Started working late nights,
Never seeing daylight, getting paid like a slave might,
And I've done too many years to miss this for my missus,
To have to tell my son he nearly never existed

[Chorus]

Dj Debris c'mon and break it down like,

And I speak what I feel in the booth in the spirit of truth,
Cause all these kids that I meet man they mirror my youth,
And I could have gone the wrong way, the easy option,
But I chose to go the long way, the streets are watching,

So keep a look out, look up, B-ballers keep your hook up,
Tear a page from my book out, and pull out,
Your finger put your foot out and keep a lookout,
For what we put out, the brand new flavor for your cookout

This is for the heads that's loving the mix
My people in the front, all covered in spit
Batters in the box (uh), Suffa to pitch(what)
Hilltop Hoods, all up in this bitch
And we the funk leaders, punks you can't beat us
We bump and pump meters, we drunk you chumps need us
So jump with us, down in the front entrance (if it's your flavor)
Your flavor, come get drunk with us (woo!)
This life turned out nothing like
I had planned (why not?)
By now I should've had some land
Some money in my hand, 'round about fifty grand
But I got nothing (nothin'), I write rhymes on the bus
I keep suffering (sufferin), fuck the lines of the dust
You keep sniffing, that shit is for the punk hoes (whoa!)
This shit is for my bros, my people in the front row

You know I looked around, for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
(Ho how) 
You know I looked around, for faces I'd know,
I fell in love with the people in the front row
(Ho how, check it out) 

I got hip-hop taste buds
I wanna hear that bass when I make love
Wanna hear some lyrics when I wake up
Write rhymes to get me through a break up, bitch!
Rather whiskey straight, no chaser
Went through fifty breaks, no flavor
Till I found this one, and made the
Bass hook with the drum, my savior
This is the comeback, tongue that's sharp like a thumbtack
It's so tight James is saying give my funk back
One track, eight track, a-dat, residual
Noise, band funk that we claim with the digital
Toys I'm the Apache, you're failing to match me
Throw your hands in the air like you're hailing a taxi
And move to the funk flow, you stepping, are you drunk bro?
This is for my peeps and the freaks in the front row

You know I looked around, for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
(Ho how)
You know I looked around, for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
(Ho how) 

People don't complain if Suffa's in here,
And you're in the front row, all covered in beer
And club owners don't say ""the place is wrecked, it's your fault"" (uh huh)
If the roof is on fire it's an electrical fault
Man I bet you all bolt, when I bring it live
Like Friday night footy, in my hoodie can hide I
Get live on the breaks son, like pace one
Lads, if you're heading to the bar grab your mates one
Ladies come chill, come rock with me honey
I got like half a mill in monopoly money
There's no stopping me honey, so you can take my hand
We can lay on the beach and count grains of sand
Or take a plane to Japan, and drink sake with mafia
Fly to Libya for some Bacardi with Qaddafi a
Dinner date, followed by a funk show
We'll rip off our tops and jump around in the front row

You know I looked around, for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
(Ho how) 
You know I looked around, for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
(Ho how) 

Look me here, and I'm all yours, not for the money
And it's not for the applause, no
Oh no no no (It's for the nosebleed section)

M. Lambert,"Pressure (x6)
It's the next chapter, where's all my head at?
You slept at the fact that we crept back to,
Set factors straight, the only dead rappers,
Are penned at the papes of no cred actors,
Those haters, no you don't phase us,
'cause you don't know shit so, you're on a need to know basis,
And those gracious folk with no status,
I made this flow for you, no your own name is,
Not a part of the bigger picture, listen it's the,
Middle finger that you put up in a fist yeah,
Life's a bitch and it'll hit you,
If I could pimp women like I do words I'd be living a little richer,
Hip Hop's a circus act this is absurd but fact,
One critic or cynic for every that learned to rap,
One lyric with gimmick for every with purpose that,
Furthered rap culture round the earth and back,
But some diss but when I'm up in your face,
You're a man of your word; you got nothing to say,
I got respect for the scene and love for the place,
Where I bled for my dreams and struggled for change,
We're still striving on, were still alive and strong,
Right or wrong I'd still kill for where I belong,
Insightful on the real deal when I write a song,
Question, you still feel the vibe I'm on?

Verse 2 Suffa
I had the whole crowd like, oh shit, that's right I said it,
I'll be like, da, da, da, da, roll like the credits,
Two of the best to ever edit poetics,
It be the three headed beast from Obese come to set it,
Off, Hilltop in the place, sir just calm down,
Spit fire on stage and burn your bar down,
You hear it bumping in clubs you turn your car round,
You hear it pumping in pubs you buy the bar a round,
Pump it up in your car; turn your car into a club,
Smash through the wall of a pub and burn the bar down,
Just burn the bar down, like a disco inferno,
MCs aren't the only thing we burn though,
I'm the arsonist like Rakim is,
So ask your kids who the number one artist is,
Obese got the mad fucking roster while,
Your crew couldn't even house a foster child,
You're flamboyant like Oscar Wilde, I got to smile,
When you panic on stage like you lost a child,
Where's Benny? Benny's across the road watching Hilltop,
'cause they got the flow the hills have still got,
The skills, the beats to get nice on,
Don't need drugs, I get a buzz when the mics on,
So hit the floods Suffa like it with the lights on,
Hilltop, we're what's left when the vibe's gone.

J'ai mes yeux dans tes yeux
Pris au piège dans ton jeu
Elle et moi moi moi
Baby, ce soir aucune ne peut te ressembler
J'aime la façon que t'as de vouloir m'attirer
J'ai mes yeux dans tes yeux
Pris au piège dans ton jeu
Elle et moi moi moi

M. Pokora,"On se retourne vers dieu quand sa tourne mal
Quand le ciel s'écroule sur nos petites étoiles
On se sent si seul quand le train déraille
De la pluie dans mes yeux quand l'espoir détale
Quand je voie maman perdre ses pédales
On s'en remet à dieu sur son lit d'hôpital
Je perds l'équilibre sur mon triste manège
Sous le soleil d'été je voie tomber la neige
On ne se moque plus de dieu quand les pelles nous assiège

Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
Enfermé dans ton mal-être
Quand les anges pleurent au bord de ta fenêtre
Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
A se torturer la tête
Si l'espoir meurt, pourra-t-il renaître?
Regarde-moi brûler, quand s'éteint la lumière
Écoute-moi crier aux portes de l'enfer
Regarde-moi tomber sans plus personne derrière
Redevenir poussière

On s'en remet à dieu quand la roue a tourné
Les amies t'oublient comme une chanson d'été
L'amour lui aussi s'endort sur ses regrets
On se retourne vers dieu quand on descend l'échelle
Car l'argent c'est bien mais ce n'est pas éternel
On ne fera pas long feu si on ne vole qu'avec une aile

Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
Enfermé dans ton mal-être
Quand les anges pleurent au bord de ta fenêtre
Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
A se torturer la tête
Si l'espoir meurt, pourra-t-il renaître?
Regarde-moi brûler, quand s'éteint la lumière
Écoute-moi crier aux portes de l'enfer
Regarde-moi tomber sans plus personne derrière
Redevenir poussière

C'est la lumière ou le noir
L'amour ou la gloire
La défaite, la victoire
Soit tu gagne soit tu foire
On veut juste s'évader
S'enfuir de nos cauchemars
J'veux pas rater ma vie, rater mon train
Toucher l'infini comme si j'mourrais demain
J'veux pas que tu m'oublie quand ta des chagrins

Et si je te demandais sur une vie quels sont tes dispos

Ce qui reste des saisons, je veux le passer avec toi.

(My boo) Juste un je t'aime et pour toi j'gravirai l'Everest

Pour tout ces retours en arrière
Et toutes ces routes inachevées
Et celles qu'on ne reprendra jamais

Toutes ces épreuves
Et ces jours maudits
Qui font comprendre qu'on a qu'une seule vie

On danse
On danse
Chaque jour qui se lève est un jour de chance
On danse
On danse
Danse comme si c'était notre dernière chance

Aux mots qu'on a pu regretter
A ceux qu'on a pas su aimer (Assez)
A toutes ces fois où l'on déraille
Aux traces qui nous suivent où qu'on aille

Jusqu'aux épreuves
Aux jours maudits
Qui font comprendre qu'on a qu'une seule vie

On danse
On danse
Chaque jour qui se lève est un jour de chance
On danse
On danse
Danse comme si c'était notre dernière chance

On danse jusqu'à n'en plus pouvoir
De chant mêlé de cris d'espoir
Comme si c'était le dernier soir
Le début d'une autre histoire

Ne plus regarder en arrière
Oublier tout ce qu'on a souffert
Tout balayer d'une main, d'un revers
Changer ce qu'on a pas su faire

Alors on danse
On danse
Chaque jour qui se lève est un jour de chance
On danse
On danse
Danse comme si c'était notre dernière chance

On danse
On danse
Chaque jour qui se lève est un jour de chance
On danse
On danse
Danse comme si c'était notre dernière chance

Oh je veux nous voir danser
Oui encore nous voir danser
Ne laisse pas passer cette chance, oh

Oh, je veux nous voir danser
Et encore nous voir danser
Ne laissons pas, ne laissons pas passer cette dernière chance
Je veux nous voir danser
Et encore nous voir danser
Ne laissons pas, ne laissons pas passer cette dernière chance",On danse,2015
M. Pokora,"Jolie, ma jolie
Pourquoi tu parais déçue?
Jolie, oh ma jolie
Tes rêves, que sont-ils devenus?
Souviens-toi de nos jeux
Souviens-toi de nos rires
Et de ces promesses
Qu’on n’a pas pu tenir
Mais sache que tu resteras toute ma vie
La plus belle chose que j’ai laissée
La plus belle chose que j’ai laissée
La plus belle chose que j’ai laissée

Il faut dire qu’on s’est trop dit
Que nos paroles savent blesser parfois
Trop vite, on s’est promis
Mais le cœur a des envies, pas d'loi
Nos peines feront des histoires
Qui feront des livres
Tu sauras y voir
Qu’ils racontent nos désirs
Y voir que t'es et resteras au long de ma vie
La plus belle chose que j’ai laissée
La plus belle chose que j’ai laissée
La plus belle chose que j’ai laissée

Jolie, ma jolie, dis-moi après quoi tu cours?
Promis, j’ai aussi parfois voulu fuir le jour
J’ai vu danser l’ombre parmi nos souvenirs
Dont le danger te ronge et pousse au pire

Jolie, ma jolie, je voudrai encore t’entendre rire
Jolie, ma jolie, je voudrais qu’tu m’entendes le dire
T’es la plus belle chose que j’ai laissée

Comme elle manque de souffle
Allô le monde si vous saviez, si vous saviez

J'ai essayé de comprendre, on m'a dit : ""c'est la vie""
Du mal à l'accepter donc je passe toutes mes nuits
A jouer au puzzle avec les photos de famille
J'ai le sourire en détention
Il n'y a que leur réconciliation pour payer la caution
Leur problème d'adulte, j'te jure, est une sale infection
Une épidémie que connaît ma cours de récréation
Ne me demande pas de choisir
Je les aime d'un amour indivisible
Qu'ils se fassent la guerre ou pas
Je sais que ces deux soldats ont mon bonheur pour cible

Je chantais pour la première fois 
Le public ne me connaissait pas 
Quelle année, cette année-là 

Cette année-là 
Le rock'n'roll venait d'ouvrir ses ailes 
Et dans mon coin, je chantais belle, belle, belle 
Et le public aimait ça 

Déjà, les Beatles étaient quatre garçons dans le vent 

Et moi, ma chanson disait marche tout droit 

Cette année-là 
Quelle joie d'être l'idole des jeunes 
Pour des fans qui cassaient les fauteuils 
Plus j'y pense et moins j'oublie 

J'ai découvert mon premier, mon dernier amour 
Le seul, le grand, l'unique et pour toujours le public 

Cette année-là 
Dans le ciel passait une musique 
Un oiseau qu'on appelait Spoutnik 
Quelle année, cette année-là 

C'est là qu'on a dit adieu à Marilyn au cœur d'or 
Tandis que West Side battait tous les records 

Cette année-là 
Les guitares tiraient sur les violons 
On croyait qu'une révolution 
Arrivait cette année-là 

(Break it down)

C'était hier, mais aujourd'hui, rien n'a changé 
C'est le même métier qui ce soir recommence encore 

Ok, ça c'est pour tout le monde à la maison 
On clappe des mains tous ensemble 
C'est ça 

C'était l'année, c'était l'année soixante deux 
C'était l'année, c'était l'année soixante deux

Or a clarinet or violin

M. Shadows,"We seem so lost and jaded
Well what a price to pay
Fear can be overstated,
and you seem infatuated
with finding who's to blame.

While it can seem so hard now,
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way.

Don't tell me it's too late,
cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
and let others lead the way.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still we push further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

Some feel that life's a favor,
While some don't have the time.
Wash up and kiss the alter,
All hail the mighty father,
but love will keep you blind.

Same questions we keep asking,
Won't hear the answers cause we're scared of what we'll find

We try and compensate through our troubled faith that should keep us safe
and keep searching for a sign.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still still we march further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

There wont be another day, the (no?) changing of the seasons,
And no one's gonna save us from the lies.

The greatest story ever told,
Is only what you make it.
There will be struggle and fear,
All by design

To the top I go Where I’m from its cold
But I don’t need this coat, keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city’s area code on my shoulder, 216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove like

“Fuck this broke shit”, petty ass hustlin
Couldn’t even sell one zone
Slim still workin at the store and the only time
We ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here, prayin for a rainbow
To lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to

Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that I made it
Cause’ real EST mufuckas don’t fold
Real EST mufuckas dont break up
Real family grows old, Real EST mufuckas representing
For the city where they came even when they gone

And Fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the Eastside
Just these broken bomes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get their fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep

Muthafuck this rap shit
Try burying your boy 6 feet let me show u bout real
Try telling me that u can’t make it up
Out the city 26 dollars to multi-mill’s
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the Eastside still
Well bitch I did, and its still the kid
Labelled a Bad Boy before this deal

What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that
Bled with me knowin I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Looking at the house of pain
I’ma runaway from the ones that pay me hopin

M. Shadows,"It's early morning
And the sun holds no redemption for me
And I then discover
All the scratches running up and down my spine
From the other night

I stagger onward
And the pain is nearly crippling me
Such sweet destruction
I'm a glutton when the decadence tastes right
Like the other night

The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control, all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul, who desires to leave all their cares behind

Later in the evening
I can hear all the vices calling to me
So I take another
Little taste, to liberate my mind
From the finest kind

Yeah the night's beginning
And the sea of bodies crowd around me
Ready to remember
All the greatest moments lived in their lifetime
For another night

The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control, all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul, who desires to leave all their cares behind

I'm not the only one, learn a little lesson from me
I'm a leviathan, focused on fulfilling a need
The faint of heart observe the bolder ones setting the bar
A feeding frenzy when the starving just forget where they are

You're in denial when you say you never wanted a taste
And you don't really want to let this stimulant go to waste
So don't deny it go on and try it
I'm looking forward to the moment when your mind will fall in love with the haze

The euphoric feeling is so right
When it seizes control, all my inhibitions are left behind
And I know that reality really won't mind
A benevolent soul, who desires to leave all their cares behind

I will fight, I will battle
Decimating all at will
This is it to a pulse
And if I feel for you
I will fight, I will battle
For a better life for you

What up out there kenfo
This be fiend coming at like this here here
I brought a couple of my people with me
Fiend, mac, soulja slim, kane and abel
A couple of no limit soldiers to help me out with this here

Chorus
What cha mean, mean, heard about
Soldiers got some daily clout
Slangin in the dirty south
What we really worried about x2

[soulja slim]
(peep this shit) I know you heard about this nigga from the 3rd
Raw, then a uncut bird with bad tempers and bad nerves
Serve, dope to a dope fiend gotta get more cream
Than the rest of the dealers
Every nigga that I fuck with gotta be from killas
Fill up in this shit, that was ever smokin, you can catch me smokin
On some shit that will have me broken, (cough cough),
I'm so high, I can ride, barely need to slug some dealing
No optimos, no keep moving, fuck it, pass the feeling
Real niggas feel me, cause I'm bout as real as it get
Son or stranger, no love for that studio shit
All my little partners gone, I'll be damned if I g-o
But if I do I'll grab my gun shoot like and pull let em know

Chorus x2

[kane & abel]
You know I'm from the ghetto, hit the glock
And pop my shots clean up your block
Red beam, maintain my aim, bullet holes in your brain
When I stop that motherfucking clock, kane
Usual suspect, down south niggas bout respect
Choppin off slugs like a mailman in a corvette
Like the weed when I lower my tek
Niggas is seeking, pump down like bricks, in the trunk of the 626
Is something you hate cause your boy
Just got flipped, ak with a strong clip
In the hood I bust you with the tank,
In the pen I trust you with the shank
My mind go blank, I'm a soldier smokin dank
All the way to the motherfucking bank

Chorus x2

[mac]
Now what y'all mean, niggas on my team
They all about the cream
And my enemies, we take it to the street
To get the green, knowa mean
Came here with slim, mac and fiend
I still scream woah!
In the drop where my nigga walk
Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black, I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south
Where the po-po's scout
Everybody, everybody that knows what your bout
Won't leave your house
Cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin
You might connect the grip
Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship
Like the peoples in summertime agent trip
Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a, they be them friends of me
Woah, slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged
I'm psycho warden I stay on my guard and bitch I never die

Chorus x2

[fiend]
What the world don't know is I'm a hurt
A soldier without a pause
I'm prayin about cause, break jaws and all laws
My bullet scars didn't heal, my tatoos reveal
Bout to ride explain a million of hostile
The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives, I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set, families with teks, release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers, we the best fuck all the rest, here hit the cess
Snort, c'mon the test
With the charge the best, cause I open your chest
God bless, I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever, should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks, me, slim, twins, and mac
Gotta attack, with the jest to ask, deftly in the act
I doubt that, I'm strange cause I'm with the right change
After soldier consediration, I'm the live range

So many rainy days and gun sprays, I'm hearing AK's out my window 
Close my shades, let me blaze on this indo 
My situation getting sticky, life is green 
I mean I'm 19, and my momma is a dope fiend 
And I think about all the hard times we had 
No dad, no time shared, the buster never cared 
A little bastard child, going wild, 
Another victim of a broken home, my TRU friend was the chrome 
And if it wasn't for bad, I had no luck at all 
I represented my hood, I sprayed my name on the wall 
Fresh outta jail, and I'm here to see the sun rise another year 
But tell me where do we go from here

Most of my niggas serve life sentences, only the few is risen 
I made it out the hood but my people still there 
Some of them dead, strung out, up in they wheelchair 
I still care from a distance 
and I know that any day could lead me back to that crimey insistence 
I tell the kids be persistent, when they follow they dreams 
Ain't no telling what tomorrow brings 
Ain't no time to be wasting, you want to be a doctor or the patient? 
Hesitation can lead to expiration, only God can predict it, 
Where do we go from here, snorting powder, drinking beer 
Smokin' crack, killin' our peers, I shed tears

and where do we go after we ain't got no place to call home 
Hell I'm just glad to be breathing 
?? like I was the projects for a reason 
Shit, tell my niggas we gotta live, and some gotta give 
why'all gotta rise above this shit, and turn negatives into positive 
Yeah I struggled, but I'ma hustler, and that's self explanatory 
So if I die trying, the hood can just tell why'all my story 
Niggas seen killings and drug dealings, 
imagine we'd dream through it all 
Old ladies ?? through the window, I guess she done seen it all 
It's up to you, cause nobody seems to jam with us

One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying with out wings

Some find it in sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So, impossible as it may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

Well, for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunlight on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine
And it's the flying without wings
Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends

Don't exactly mean I had to get rid of my Thug Mentality

M.A.M,"Ich glaube, dass im Leben nichts nur so geschieht
Weil man die Dinge von unten nicht wie von oben sieht
In jedem tiefen Tal, in jedem Rosenkrieg
Findet man Schätze, aus denen man seine Vision entzieht
Denn am Ende fügt sich alles zusammen
Ja, ein Löwe hängt nicht ab mit allen Ratten und Schlangen
Guck, ich mach' das hier schon alles zu lang
Und jemand, der sich selbst nicht kennt, ist kein erwachsener Mann, nein
Mein Mosaik, es leuchtet in Kristallfarben
Auch wenn wir uns fühlen, als ob wir keinen Halt haben
Alles ist schon längst bestimmt und alles, was wir tun
Ist nur die Angst im Kopf, den Kopf von ihrem Hals schlagen
Und ich spür', wie die Kontraste verschwimmen

Das Leben zeigte mir, dass alles richtig läuft
Solange man sich selbst am Ende nicht enttäuscht

Ich früher in der Tiefe, bin heut tiefenentspannt
Und mach' es nur für mich und Mama, weil es niemand dir dankt
Hab' ein Haus mit einem Garten, bloß dank meiner Musik
Hab' lila Scheine verdient aus meinem eigenen Trieb
Ich hab' Wien auf die Karte gesetzt, Musik ist ein hartes Geschäft
Doch sie hat meine Kunst und meine Lieder auf Platten gepresst
Mein Mosaik, es leuchtet längst von allen Seiten
In meinem Kopf seh' ich neue Bilder von alten Zeiten
Album Nummer neun, ich hab' den Thron verdient
Alles, was noch vor mir liegt, ein Stück von meinem Mosaik

M.A.M.,"Seh' wie die Zeit vergeht und sich der Zeiger dreht
Die Zukunft die wir geplant hatten haben wir beide leider weit verfehlt
Jede zweite Chance und jeder Streit umsonst
Du warst der Grund für die Melancholie in meinen Songs
Wir hielten zusammen, kämpften gegeneinander
Doch es gab zu viele Gründe weshalb ich dich dann aus meinem Leben verbannt hab'
Denn ich sah' dich in Träumen, doch war blind vor Liebe
Es war ein Tanz mit dem Teufel es noch hinzubiegen
Wir haben nach Freiheit verlangt doch waren beide gefangen
Es gab keinen Grund für einen Seitensprung, nur in deinem Verstand
Wir sind Fremde geworden, die sich sehr gut kennen
Denn Gewohnheit und Sehnsucht, waren immer schwer zu trennen

Und selbst wenn wir es gut machen
Könnten wir es dann vielleicht nie wieder gut machen
Ey, vielleicht sollten wir alte Träume ruhen lassen
Bevor sie uns verfolgen und nie wieder ruhen lassen

Andere Mentalität doch trotzdem auch irgendwie gleich
Wir haben gemeinsam gewonnen doch heute verlieren wir uns zwei
Denn egal was wir taten, es hat nie wirklich gereicht
Wir hielten so fest an dem Fallschirm im Biz, unser Band riss
Du hattest ständig die Angst das ein anderes Leben für mich interessant ist
Seh' dich lachend auf Fotos, doch weiß das du weinst

Sag wo sind wir jetzt? Und wo waren wir davor?
Schau ich bin schon weg, und du mit der Lage d' accord

That suicide is painless

And I can take or leave it if I please

Gonna to lose it anyway

I'm going crazy, crazy for you
And have you ever loved somebody that would give it all for you
I'm going crazy, crazy for you

I've always been by myself 
Lived life by myself
Never cared for solitude
Just cared for the wealth
Steady stackin'
Never slackin'
With no time to be wastin'
While these other dudes chasin' broads
I was chasin' their paper
But then (but then) came you (came you)

And I ain't felt this way in a minute
And I ain't gonna lie to you ma

Trade my world and I'd give my life

And every day you make it clear that you don't want to be replaced
Just by them little things you do, just by them little things you say

From court dates to miscarriages to you losing your mama
But now (but now) I see (I see)
That you're my one and only
Baby oh I'm going crazy
I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more

Memories ease my pain
I keep hearing you laughin', screamin', callin' my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

Is just the thought of you

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack

All that I should be 
But I'm so glad, so glad that I'm not, 
Not what I used to be 
The places I used to go, 
People I used to know 
Things that I used to do have all changed 
Now that I know 

There's been some changes 
Yeah 
Into my life 
Into my life

If any man be in Christ 
He is a new creature 
All things are passed away 
All things are new 
Change,change, you can change 
There's a new life 
Waiting for you 

So, I'll say bye bye bye bye bye 
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday
Bye bye to yesterday

M.D. West,"I been thinking sitting on a pole. 
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told. 
Just me and the mirror and my brain. 
But that was when I got an idea. 
Came like a gun and shot in my ear. 
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone? 

Fifteen years I lay down on the ground. 
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound. 
Fifteen million years I spent down the line. 
But that was when I got an idea. 
Came like a gun and shot in my ear. 
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone? 
Get up and stand alone 

That was when I got an idea. 
Came like a gun and shot in my ear. 
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone? 
Get up and stand alone. 

That's when I got an idea [Repeat: x2]",The Idea,2005
M.D. West,"[Chorus:]
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 

[Chorus]

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know, I know 
I know this love's forever 
That's all that matters now 
No matter what!",No Matter What...Love Goes On,2005
M.E. Smith,"Clear skin, clear head
Clear smile, dead style
Designer beach clothes
A little bit of a paunch.

This beach-boy Achilles,
A former leading light of radio
Drowned in suntan lotion
Makes a bold declaration:

'We drove the Moors back into the sea and now we ride their waves!'
And a little bit of something about the positive vibes of the sea
'I feel at one with the waves!'
He said: 'Let's get a Big Mac, tune into happening sounds, check out the chicks on the beach and 
chill out,

Chill out,
Chill out.'

'We all crawled out of the sea'--and then he winked--'didn't we?'
'We drove the Moors back into the sea and now we ride their waves!'
(Mark Smith)

I am the fire in your lungs
I am the fire in your dead lungs
I am the fire in the airwaves
