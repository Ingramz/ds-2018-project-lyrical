Mandisa,"Hey, heard you were up all night
Thinking about how your world ain't right
And you wonder if things will ever get better
And you're asking, why is it always raining on you
When all you want is just a little good news
Instead of standing there stuck out in the weather

Oh, don't hang your head
It's gonna end
God's right there
Even if it's hard to see Him
I promise you that He still cares

When the waves are taking you under
Hold on just a little bit longer
He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger
The pain ain't gonna last forever
And things can only get better
Believe me
This is gonna make you stronger
Gonna make you stronger, stronger, stronger
Believe me, this is gonna make you

Try and do the best you can
Hold on and let Him hold your hand
Go on and fall into the arms of Jesus
Oh, lift your head it's gonna end
God's right there
Even when you just can't feel Him
I promise you that He still cares

When the waves are taking you under
Hold on just a little bit longer
He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger
The pain ain't gonna last forever
Things can only get better
Believe me
This is gonna make you stronger

'Cause if He started this work in your life
He will be faithful to complete it
If only you believe it
He knows how much it hurts
And I'm sure that He's gonna help you get through this

When the waves are taking you under
Hold on just a little bit longer
He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger
The pain ain't gonna last forever
Things can only get better
Believe me
This is gonna make you stronger
gonna make you stronger, stronger, stronger
This is gonna make you stronger
Gonna make you stronger, stronger, stronger
Believe me
Only gonna make you stronger",Stronger,2011
Mandisa,"People going on and on
They don't know what they got wrong
This world won't keep you satisfied
They say you gotta buy this
Wear this, drive that car
'Cause that's the kind of thing
That makes you who you are
But don't keep throwin' that my way

No more temporary fills
I want a love that's real
Take everything I have and fill me up inside
I'm done looking for the quick fix
Jesus, Your love is all I'll ever need
No more temporary fills

I've turned every rock and stone
Gone everywhere there was to go
But I only felt better for a while
'Cause nothing can replace You
Erase You from my heart
And that's the kind of thing
That makes You who You are
You're the reason I can say

No more temporary fills
I want a love that's real
Take everything I have and fill me up inside
I'm done looking for the quick fix
Jesus, Your love is all I'll ever need

And nothin' temporary could ever make me
Feel the way You do
'Cause what You've given to me
I know that it will last my whole life through

Whoa, no more temporary fills
I want a love that's real
Take everything I have and fill me up inside
I'm done looking for the quick fix
Jesus, Your love is all I'll ever need
No more temporary fills
No more
No more
No more
No more hidin'
No more temporary
No more temporary
No more temporary",Temporary Fills,2011
Mandisa,"I never liked Mondays or bad news
Or breakin' in new shoes
And mornings when I can't find my phone
Nobody likes traffic or short nights
Or sit-ups or long flights
But sometimes that's just the way it goes
It's funny what you use to help me grow

So I'll learn to love these days
Life along the way
In the middle of the crazy
God your love is so amazing
Through the ups and downs
You're the only hope I've found
Lord you meet me in the madness

I'll learn to love these days
I'll learn to love these days

I can see a silver linin'
When the sun's not shinin'
Even when you choose to bring the rain
Oh there's freedom in believin'
I'm trustin' your leadin'
'Cause your Lord of all my joy and all my pain

So I'll learn to love these days
Life along the way
In the middle of the crazy
God, your love is so amazing
Through the ups and downs
You're the only hope I've found
Lord you meet me in the madness

I'll learn to love these days
I'll learn to love these days

I could wait the hundred years
You gave me here the days when you near
The days when I was out there
Lookin' for what comes next
Oh, 'cause every minute, every hour, every day
Is such a gift and I'm content
I'm thankful for each day

So I'll learn to love these days
Life along the way
In the middle of the crazy
Your love is so amazing
Through the ups and downs
You're the only hope I've found

I'll learn to love these days",These Days,2011
Mandisa,"If only I could see me as you see me
And understand the way that I am loved
Would it give a whole new meaning to my purpose
Change the way I see the world

Would I sparkle like a star in the night sky
Would I give a little more instead of take
If I understood I'm precious like the diamond
I'm a worth no one could estimate
I'm a worth no one could estimate

You say lovely
I say broken
I say guilty
You say forgiven
I feel lonely
Say you're with me
We both know it would change everything
If only I believed the truth about me

I wish I could hold on to the moments
When my life is spinnin' but I'm peaceful still
Like a wind you whispered in the silence
And tell me things this world never will
You tell me things this world never will

You say lovely
I say broken
I say guilty
You say forgiven
I feel lonely
Say you're with me
We both know it would change everything
If only I believed the truth about me

I would sleep better at night
Wake up with hope for another day
I would love even if it cost me
Take a chance and know I'm goin' be okay
I would dare to give my life away

Oh, I feel lonely
Say you're with me
We both know it would change everything
If only I believed the truth about me",The Truth About Me,2011
Mandisa,"Well, I'm tired of saying everything
I feel like I'm supposed to say
I'm tired of smiling all the time
I wanna throw the mask away
Sometimes you just have a bad day
Sometimes you just wanna scream
Tell me I'm not the only one
Tell me that you feel just like me

We keep tryin' to make it look so nice
And we keep hidin' what's goin' on inside
But what if I share my brokenness
What if you share how you feel
And what if we weren't afraid of this crazy mess

What if we were real
What if we were real

I'm over hidin' my tears
I think I'm gonna let 'em go
I'm over actin' so strong
When I ain't even in control
We make it so complicated
But why does it have to be
Why can't we open our hearts and let everybody see

We keep tryin' to make it look so nice
And we keep hidin' what's goin' on inside
But what if I share my brokenness
What if you share how you feel
And what if we weren't afraid of this crazy mess

What if we were real

We'd think a little less of ourselves
We'd care about somebody else
'Cause we'd know just how they feel
Maybe we could let someone love us
Maybe we'd a little more like Jesus
Why can't we learn to real

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (yeah,yeah)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

We keep tryin' to make it look so nice

Mandisa,"Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight
Glory stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ, the Saviour is born, Christ, the Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth, Jesus, Lord at Thy birth",Silent Night,2012
Mandisa,"I'd heard your name, but never seen your face
Been touched before but never your embrace
Had a soul to lose and the world to gain
But then you whispered my name

And I heard the truth but never from your lips
Bought the lies of many counterfeits
Dreamed my dreams, but they were never in color
And I searched for you and many others

I was down for the count

Then I saw your face
Just a glimpse of your face, and my whole world changed
Then I saw your face, and I was changed forever
Changed forever now
Then I saw your face
One glimpse of your face, it's a whole new game
Then I saw your face, and I was changed forever
Yours forever now

If I could reach the stars, I could touch the sky
And if I spread my wings, I could almost fly
I had everything paper could buy
I was lost in my disguise

And if I played my role, they would feel my style
If I bought the night they would buy my smile
I've been runnin' this game for a million miles
Believin' my own lies

I was down, I was out

Then I saw your face
Just a glimpse of your face, and my whole world changed
Then I saw your face, and I was changed forever
Changed forever now
Then I saw your face
One glimpse of your face, it's a whole new game
Then I saw your face, and I was changed forever
Yours forever now

Then I saw your face

I was blinded by my selfish dreams
Everything ain't what it seems
From inside to out, there ain't no doubt
I been changed

Nothing short of satisfaction
Your love caused a change reaction
I can tell you this much I felt your touch
And I'm changed

When I was down for the count, your love surrounded me
Blink of an eye, I saw my destiny

Change, rearranged 'cause I couldn't maintain
The heart it took to even stay in the game
One look in your eyes even I realized
A fellow like me had been put down to size
To be built up in a better way, your way
Yahweh ain't about to fade
Bombastic, ain't no way to mask it
I saw your face, and my old way's blasted

Then I saw your face
Just a glimpse of your face, and my whole world changed
Then I saw your face, and I was changed forever
Changed forever now
Then I saw your face
One glimpse of your face, it's a whole new game
Then I saw your face, and I was changed forever
Yours forever now

Then I saw your face
Just a glimpse of your face, and my whole world changed
Then I saw your face",Changed Forever,2012
Mandisa,"How firm a foundation, you saints of the lord
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word
What more can he say than to you he has said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled

Fear not, he is with us, oh be not dismayed
For he is our god, our sustainer and strength
He'll be our defender and cause us to stand
Upheld by his merciful, almighty hand

How firm, our foundation
How sure, our salvation
And we will not be shaken
Jesus, firm foundation

The soul that is trusting in Jesus as lord
Will press on enduring the darkest of storm
And though even hell should endeavor to shake
He'll never, no never, no no never forsake
He'll never, no never, no no never forsake

How firm, our foundation
How sure, our salvation
And we will not be shaken
Jesus, firm foundation

Age to age he stands
Faithful to the end
All may fade away
But he will remain
He will remain!

How firm, our foundation
How sure, our salvation
And we will not be shaken

I could never say enough to thank you
For everything you’ve done for me
And I might think I could do enough to show you but I know

Mandisa,"Dear John,
How you doin’
I’ve been thinking about you
I’m not sure how to say it,
But I’ve been praying daily
For some kind of a breakthrough

I’ve said this a thousand times
And I know you don’t see my side
But I do it ‘cause I love you
So, dear John
Here’s the truth

There’s freedom
On the other side of
Things that keep us tied up and afraid
There’s hope in every situation
No matter what you’re facing everyday
But it’s up to you
You get to choose
Your Father is waiting there with open arms

Dear John,
People hurt you
And you know I’ve been hurt too
There’s no way to escape it,
Don’t let your pain be wasted
No, don’t let it get the best of you
‘Cause God took my broken parts
And gave me a brand new start
Now I am walking, breathing, living proof
And, dear John, He can do this for you

There’s freedom
On the other side of
Things that keep us tied up and afraid
There’s hope in every situation
No matter what you’re facing everyday
But it’s up to you
You get to choose
Your Father is waiting there with open arms

(Dear John)
It’s a not a list of do’s and don’ts
Not a record of your faults
He gave his life pay it all
(Dear John) He loves you just the way you are
You are forgiven by His scars
Just open up your heart, (your heart)

There’s freedom
On the other side of
Things that keep us tied up and afraid

No matter what you’re facing everyday
But it’s up to you
You get to choose

Mandisa,"I stood at a canyon
A great divide
Sin left me stranded
With You on the other side
I thought I was hopeless
But in my heart
I heard a still small voice that was callin’ my name
And all the miles between started melting away

Oh, it’s amazing
Your love is erasing the distance
And You won’t stop, You won’t stop
Even in my weakest moment
I can feel You closin’ the distance
And You won’t stop, You won’t stop closin’ the distance

You are relentless
You’ve always been
Pursuer of my heart
Over and over again

Ooh, I hear the still small voice and it’s calling my name
I feel the miles between us melting away
And suddenly I can see I was never alone
You’ve been reaching for me
And pulling me close

Oh, it’s amazing
Your love is erasing the distance
And You won’t stop, You won’t stop
Even in my weakest moment
I can feel You closin’ the distance
And You won’t stop, You won’t stop (commin' for me)

Nothing can separate us
No one can stand between
From beginning to the end
Your love is enough, enough
Nothing can separate us
No one can separate us

Oh, it’s so amazing
How Your love is closin’ the distance
Even in my weakest moment
I can feel You closin’ the distance
And You won’t stop,
You won’t stop closin’ the distance

No you won't stop (You won't stop) no you won't stop

Mandisa,"Some days, I dream about Heaven
And some days, I wonder what it’s gonna be like
When I’m leaving behind the pain of this life
And sin is just a memory
‘Cause one day I’ll get to look You in the eyes

I can’t wait to be where You are
Close enough to feel Your heart
Face 2 face
Face 2 face with You, my Savior
I’m learning that the world I know
Is never gonna feel like home
‘Til I’m face 2 face

Ooh dome days, the world is just too much to take
And some days, I’m barely hanging by a thread
But I won’t let all of my fear, cripple me here
When I should be rejoicing
‘Cause I know the beauty that waits ahead

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo

He's spinning round 'n' round 'n' round until he's had enough
Going town to town to town just to prove that he's tough
Don't let him down under your skin, that's what they say
He's gonna catch some ladies today, what they say
He's gonna catch some ladies today

And when the firstborn baby starts to scream out... -Bollocks!
Smash him out at midnight, you ain't raised ortodox
Take some money, spread 'em out as wide as you can
You've got more room in your pocket then a russian, are you la la la

Little boy Jr barks a pitbull to tears,
Without even knowing, it's his most primal fear
That's your spirit Jr, maybe your light
You're gonna catch some women tonight, that's alright
You're gonna catch some women tonight

And when the firstborn baby ...

It's time for closing in those bars, you've got that rush, that's cool
Do you know, your reputation is a future O'Dole
That rope is getting closer, know that it's tight
There won't be any women tonight, not tonight
There won't be any women tonight, not tonight
There won't be any women tonight

Cause I'm lost and there's no one around
I lost my baby in the springtime
Now she's gone with the wind
And I won't be glad until your light has come

And I won't sleep with my own demons
Lord I think you got it wrong
And I'm tired of waiting for that man
I been searching for religions
Lord I think you got it wrong
Come on Jesus give me all your charms

Oh please Jesus won't you give me a sign on the road
Cause I'm lost in this brilliant world
My heart is aching for that lady but I won't find her door
Here IÂ'm stucked up with my country band

And I won't sleep with my own demons
Lord I think you got it wrong
But I'm tired of waiting for that man
I been searching for religions

Come on Jesus give me all your charms

And I won't sleep with my own demons

Mando Diao,"I didn't feel the old umbrella
I was was feeling my own self
I catched the old spark Cinderella
She was longing for James Dean

She was that high-heeled girl
Which makes and twirls
And twiggy cigarettes
And all the papers they said
The Queen is dead
But she just blew my mind

And so shes dancing at the disco
With her new pair of shoes
The guys just wanna have her
'Cause she's looking kind of cute

The tiny girl is for rent
Got money in bed
And paper in her mind
And all the children they said
Cindy is fake
But she just blew my mind

And I don't want no morning lights, no
I just want summer all around
I don't want no morning lights, no
I just want summer all around

I believe in magic and I believe in space
I believe in mantras and the human race
The tiny girl is for rent
Got money in bed

And paper in her mind
And all the children they said
Cindy is fake
But she just blew my mind

And I don't want no morning lights, no
I just want summer all around
I don't want no morning lights, no
I just want summer all around

And I don't want no morning lights, no
I just want summer all around
I don't want no morning lights, no
I just want summer all around

She's covered up with glaze
Some of us know there's beauty
Cling on, I saw her walking by
Saw her shimmering light
With no one around
Just the shadow and me there

Well, it's so hard to see through you
And so easy to know
Oh, its so hard to define you
But I just don't wanna know

No, I don't wanna know
That all that I've become
All that I ever done
Couldn't save me from falling

All my life for you
Morning into noon
Teardrops out of position

It's so hard to be near you
And so easy to love
You're so easy to love
But it's all understood

Don't believe everything you hear
She's mine for whatever we hold
It's a chemistry thing
It's a tale for the ages

Now won't you be my open books
Close your eyes, no don't ever look
Everything is in here
All that you ever wanted

It's so hard to see through you
And so easy to know
It's so hard to define you
But I just don't wanna know

I just don't wanna know
That all that I've become
All that I ever done
Couldn't save me from falling

All my life for you
Morning into noon
Teardrops out of position

It's so hard to be
It's so hard to see
Everything that I wanted
Force me out of hand
No one understands
It's my life with religion

It's so hard to see through you
And so easy to know
It's so hard to define you
But I just don't wanna know

I just don't wanna know
That all that I've become
All that I ever done
Couldn't save me from falling

All my life for you

And it's so hard to see
It's so hard to be
Everything that I wanted
Force me out of hand
No one understands
It's religion with purpose

It's so hard to see through you

Oh it's so hard to see through
You're so easy to love
You're so easy to love
But it's all understood

Mando Diao,"I was down in Amsterdam
Almost hurt myself to death
I pushed myself so hard just like the redlight girls
Well I cried and stopped to smile
I thought my career is over
And the dealer boys they had to bring me water

I stumbled over mountains
And the shadows of the street
I fell into the river
I cried and begged for mercy
And I talked to God on the telephone

But I really can't tell you what he told me
But it was a lie
No I really can't tell you what he told me
But it was a lie

When I came to in Amsterdam
The hotel showed a movie
With Marlon Brando and his friend Pacino
Well I thought that this is nice
And I'm sure I can relax now
But suddenly the room was full of demons

I escaped through the window
Almost ran a mile away
I had nowhere to go
So I cried and begged for mercy
And I talked to God on the telephone

But I really can't tell you what he told me
But it was a lie
No I really can't tell you what he told me
But it was a lie

But nothing seems to matter
In this lonesome dirty town
But for a short brief moment
I thought she was the one
And she and I were fighting
About sex, love and TV
That's why I had to get down
And talk to God on the telephone

But I really can't tell you what he told me
But it was a lie
No I really can't tell you what he told me
But it was a lie",Amsterdam,2006

Mando Diao,"Josephine is not your kind
She believes in magic and rhymes
You tried hard to make her fine
But she sleeps with acid

Do her parents know it's for real
When she asks them to be high
I don't know
But they sure will be aware of it

She smokes clouds every single night
Should be glad that she's alive
In her head she sees butterflies with pistols

Josephine is not your kind
She believes in ravers with dimes
You tried hard to see her eyes
But they're made for others

She runs to the club with some cash
And spends them all on pleasure
In her head there's some old drug
Taking care of her

And pays him with a laugh

She knows that if she ever breaks free
That she will never see the light of day
She's been blinded by the stars and dreams she craved
And if they ever let her go
She still be bound to all her fears
And all the medicine they forced her to take

[Chorus]
On and on and on she goes
On and on and on she goes
But she will never ever ever find love
Unless she takes on a fight
Along with the northern light

[Verse 2]
They found her in the basement facing east
Howling wolves and inhaling beast
Were strangling every little dream she had in there
And if she ever finds her way
They will haunt her through the day
Until she breaks and then becomes one of them, cause

The fire in the sky-- a dim light in my eye that's long faded
And I've stood where heroes have fallen their names turned to stone
Yet I remain nameless, the best friend the hero has known

Now I'm saving my strength for running
These days I'm saving my strength for running

From the age of kings when pride decided all fate
Long before war machines took charge and I was still 'wake
It was blind hope and blinders, with young men to carry between
All the death and the glory; believin' they're one and the same

Now I'm saving my strength for running
These days I'm saving my strength for running

But the stampedes of thunder, the cavalry's charge leaves me now

To and fro, and on she goes

Countdown to zero
Just begun
Countdown to zero
It's time to start the run

The city lights are fading now
As I climb into the plane
To shield me from
The stinging acid rain

And this is it, it's over now
As we taxi down runway one
Tell me please
You'll wake me when it's over

Do you realize what's happening in western Europe?
Norway, Finland, Scotland, England
We will be the first to go
Don't do it

Don't do it
Don't do it
Don't start the countdown to zero
We want to live
We want to live
We will live

Take it off
Let it go
Let it pass
Let it go",Countdown to Zero,2002

Could it be the same
Ever the same again?

Your face in the shadows alone in the night
You're in my sights
All I've been thinking I that it's right

In the park, yesterday
I saw a face that spelled danger
A friendly smile, a worried look
I mistook for a stranger

Something's biting me I'll never give in
Coming back to me again and again

I want to be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms to hold you tight
I want to be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I want to be with you
 
So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine 
To hold forevermore
And I'll savor each touch that I've wanted so much 
To feel before, to feel before
How beautiful it is
Just to be like this

Oh, baby
I can't fight this feeling anymore
Drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name and take my hand
Can you make my wish, baby, your command?
Yeah

And I was so wrong
When I realized 
And turned around that you were gone

Would you turn around and say you want me too
'cause I say I want you back
This time I really mean it

There's so much I want to tell you
I've changed so few
But I don't know what to say or do
We grew apart but I still want you in my heart

I believe it's to make a new start
Could it be
That in long
And I was so wrong

When I realized
And turned around that you were gone

You held it in your hands
I had flashes
You saw the plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

You were there in the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truth
You cut through lies
I saw the rain dirty valley

The torch in your pocket 
And the wind on your heels
You climbed on a ladder
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

Unicorns and cannonballs 
Palaces and Piers 
Trumpets, towers, and tenaments 
Wide oceans full of tears 

Flags, rags, ferryboats 
Scimitars and scarves 
Every precious dream and vision 
Underneath the stars

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door

I turn the corner, I was feeling good.
All the birds are humming, all the bees are buzzing.

Looked a little bit greener.
And the air felt cleaner.

I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time

And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?

And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

The choice was yours and noone else's

Hang your head because she is no longer there
To shine, to dazzle, or betray

Mandy Patinkin,"And the money kept rolling in from every side
Eva's pretty hands reached out and they reached wide
Now you may feel it should have been a voluntary cause
But that's not the point my friends

Think of all the people guaranteed a good time now
Eva's called the hungry to her, open up the doors
Never been a fund like the Foundation Eva Peron

Rollin', rollin', rollin'

Rollin' on in, rollin' on in
Rollin' on in, rollin' on in

Would you like to try a college education?
Own your landlord's house, take the family on vacation?
Eva and her blessed fund can make your dreams come true
Here's all you have to do my friends

Write your name and your dream on a card or a pad or a ticket
Throw it high in the air and should our lady pick it
She will change your way of life for a week or even two

Rollin' on out, rollin' on out

And the money kept rolling out in all directions
To the poor, to the weak, to the destitute of all complexions
Now cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray
But that's not the point my friends

When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books
You can tell you've done well by the happy, grateful looks
Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way
Never been a lady loved as much as Eva Peron

Mandy Patinkin,"Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?

Tell me before I ride off in the sunset, there's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're a savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do, I don't care what the Bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them but to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So what are my chances of honest advances? I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin than to lose with a halo

Tell me before I seek worthier pastures and thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
Than have no impossible dream?

Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines
I'll pay your fair gift three cheers but first tell me who'd be delighted
To witness me the top world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I live for one hundred years

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So go, if you're able to somewhere unstable and stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear, is that clear, dear?

Oh, what I'd give for a hundred years
But the physical interferes, everyday more, Oh my Creator
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart? A serious flaw, I hope You know that",Waltz for Eva and Che,1979

Where are we ever to go?
Running away, we'll do it
Why sit around, resigned?

The more you'll be wandering blind

What you've left behind

We disappoint in turn, I guess. Forget, though, we won't

Would God have let her stay

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

He wonders what their life must be

Washington, D.C.

Months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding

Slides across his face

Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years

How about you son you like you've got

And good for the country in a roundabout way

Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?

How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when voices that come
Through the window
Go

Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky
And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light

How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see, it's the only way to see

And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""
But the women who won't wait for you knows
That, however you live

Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat
Look, I made a hat
Where there never was a hat

Maddened by the stars?

Singing to be sold?
Have you decided, it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

Nothing there sings, not even a lark
Larks never will, you know, when they're captive

Mandy Patinkin,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2002

Order, design, attension, balance, harmony

Sunday, by the blue, purple, yellow, red water
On the green, purple, yellow, red grass
Let us pass through our perfect park
Pausing on a Sunday

By the cool, blue, triangular water
On the soft, green, elliptical grass
As we pass through arrangements of shadows
Towards the verticals of trees, forever

By the blue, purple, yellow, red water
On the green, orange, violet mass of the grass
In our perfect park, made of flecks of light
And dark and parasols

Of a small suburban park
On an island in the river
On an ordinary Sunday

Mandy Patinkin,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen, 
 A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
 A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
 You were just a back street girl 
 Hustling and fighting 
 Scratching and biting 
 High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
 All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
 Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
 From the bars, from the sidewalks 
 From the gutter theatrical? 
 Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall 
 High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
 For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
 A shame you did it all at twenty-six 
 There are no mysteries now 
 Nothing can thrill you 
 No-one fulfill you 
 High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
 So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be 
 You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
 You'll despair if they hate you 
 You'll be drained of all energy 
 All the young who've made it would agree 
 
 High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
 My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
 I was slap in the right place at the perfect time 
 Filled a gap--I was lucky 
 But one thing I'll say for me 
 No-one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored [From Evita],2002

You end me, pal
Second bottle
Ah, she looks for me

Bonnet flapping
Yapping
Ruff
Chicken
Pastry

Yes, she looks for me good
Let her look for me
To tell me why she left me
As I always knew she would

I had thought she understood
They have never understood
And no reason that they should

But if anybody could, finishing the hat
How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when voices that come
Through the window
Go

Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky
And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light

How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see, it's the only way to see

And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""
But the women who won't wait for you knows
That, however you live

There's a part of you always standing by
Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat
Look, I made a hat
Where there never was a hat

Mandy Patinkin,"What can you lose?
Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her
What can you lose?

But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her
What if she had to choose?

Leave it alone
Hold it all in
Better a bone
Don't even begin
With so much to win
There's too much to lose",What Can You Lose? [#],2008

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch

From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

But if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'

But I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy-passin'

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'

If you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your heart is not with me

Take heed of the stormy weather

Na morte eu descanso
Mas o sangue anda solto
Manchando os papéis, documentos fiéis
Ao descanso do patrão

Piada no exterior

Vamos faturar um milhão
Quando vendermos todas as almas
Dos nossos índios num leilão

Maneva,"Loucos são aqueles que se dizem tão normais
Dó de quem duvida que os sonhos podem ser reais
Eu levo comigo as raízes do meu pai
Honro teu legado, levo palavras de paz
Tentaram me prender ao chão, mas Deus me fez alado
Pra muitos, vagabundo, pros meus, revolucionário
Não sou pássaro em gaiola nem peixe de aquário
E vou gritar pro mundo inteiro ouvir

Manfred Krug,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Manfred Krug,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,1995

Manfred Krug,"Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together,
I'm weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.

All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Can't go on, every thing I had is gone
Stormy weather

Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time",Stormy Weather,2005
