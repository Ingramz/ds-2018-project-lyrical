Everybody dance, do-do-do

Music never lets you down
Puts a smile on your face
Any time, anyplace
Dancing helps relieve the pain
Soothes your mind, makes you happy again
Listen to those dancing feet
Close your eyes and let go
But it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa

Spinning all around the floor
Just like Rogers and Astaire
Who found love without a care
Stepping to our favorite tune
The good times always end too soon
Everybody's dancing
Lift your feet, have some fun
Come on everybody, get on your feet
Clap your hands
Everybody's screaming

Chic,"High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High

Like the feeling
That you're feeling
When you're stoned to the bone

Don't get played out
Never fade out
'Cause you stayed out
All night long

Stayed out all night long

Gotta have it
Gotta habit
There's a monkey on your back

In the valley of the dolls
Groovin' danceamaniacs

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get high
On a trip
The natural tip
I don't need no kinda' drugs

Sip with care
But don't be scared
You can never get too much
(Never get too much)

Gimme music, we can use it
There's no turning back for us
All for one, here's to freedom
In groove we trust

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get

Chic,"[Chorus: x 2]

Life going nowhere - lost you don´t care
Got no job, no money, no love - and got no honey
Bills are growing through the roof - tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max - it´s jusagroove

[Chorus]

Look before you leap - think before you speak
Loose lips sink ships - head trips could make you slip
So be cool - don´t be a fool
Tell you what you gotta do - max to the max - it´s jusagroove

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just shoot your best shot - it might hit the spot
But don´t lose your cool - because life should be - jusagroove

Chic,"I'm gonna explain it
I hope you retain it
The chic mystique
Well, I would paint it
Funk
Psychedelic or solid
Sewn into place
like a stitch in a wallet
Together again
Yo! let the dancing begin
And don't stop, until the floor
Gets hot
Under your feet, because the music
Is smoking'
I'm not choking, my words are
Well spoken
Yo, when I'm talkin' loud
And I'm sayin' much, about chic
And we're gonna touch
The heart of your soul
In a special way
Yo! remember the jams way back
In the day
Well they speak for themselves
And so does this funky beat
So get on the floor and move your feet
And don't stop until you get enough
That might be never
'Cause we pull a lever-inside
That pulls on heart strings
Nile and nard
Producers (the dance kings)
So here's the chance to relive the past
But in the present you'll hit that
Dance floor fast
'Cause it's Chic
And that makes the jam for real
'Cause it's something that you can feel

Feel
Something that you can feel
Feel
Something that you can feel
Feel
Something that you can feel
Feel

Move
I say that with conviction
The floor is so packed
You'll get high from the friction
Boom
We'll fill the room with the dance move
Every time I rhyme on a chic groove

Come on with the force of an
Army brigade
And we'll be rising on the charts
Like a high-top fade
So just
Grab your partner and dosie doe
'Cause with the neat, chic beat
You're good to go

A combination of style that's sleek
And unique
Put it together
There you have it, chic
Can you dance when your socks are
Knocked off
Rock so hard
We can knock your block off
Charlie,
Get on your Harley and ride
Step to the inside
'Cause we're coming with the force
And the bass is our weapon
Sending all the suckers
Stepping for real

(Feel)
Something that you can feel
(Feel)
Something that you can feel
(Feel)
Something that you can feel
(Feel)

The urge to merge and
Surge from the chic sound
You wanna get up
'cause man, you wanna get down
A sigh of relief
Becuse the band with the knack is back
Kickin' the funk with soul
To chic it's a snap
You wanna snap your fingers
And clap your hands
Your hair will stand on end
I mean every strand
We give no slack, 'cause the band
Is just too tight
I'm on the mic and I would like to invite
All the partygoers in the mood
For a treat
Sweet, now sugar-coated, 'cause the
Music is Chic
Ah yes, that you can feel
Something that you can feel

(Feel)
Something that you can feel
(Feel) dig it
Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel

You can feel

Something that you can feel

Makes my world
Your love, sweet love
Makes my world go 'round

Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round

Your, sweet love
Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round

Never fear tomorrow
We're so strong together
We can last forever

There's no love like ours
You're my higher power
I can't get too much
And it's never enough

Your love
Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round

What your love does for me
The key that sets me free
To be what I can be
With full intensity
When your name, I speak
Sometimes my soul gets week
All my eyes can see
(is you)

In a world with me
In a world with me
In a world with me,(yeah)
In a world with me

There's one thing I know
I'll follow where you go
'Till the end of time
You'll always be mine

Makes my world go 'round
Go 'round, go 'round

Chic,"[Chorus]
He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

He's so sharp, bright and smooth
It's a pleasure just to know him
He's a graduate from the old school
Of hard knocks, the sly fox

The carbon copy of his father
If you didn't like his pa, don't bother
Some of us think these qualities are grim
To be just like the one before him

[Chorus]

It's so hard to resist him
And the fact is that he knows it
He doesn't have to be persistent
In his whole make up he shows it

Don't trust your woman's intuition
I'm guilty by my own admission
Now that he's got me in his clutches
I'm walking around with my heart on clutches

[Chorus]

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized

I wrap my arms around you so I can feel you breath

He knew I'd never make him very proud
So I ran away from home to live all alone
And make myself a standout in the crowd

I had to be what I was meant to be
Now my name is up in lights and I hoof here every night

Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seemed

And when you think love's gone
You still carry on

A stimulating kiss, that felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another caress
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness

Whispering through the frozen morning light
And tell me what's to come
Saying my time is near
Never fear
I close each year
I'm winter

Reminding me to trade my t-shirts for my woven wools
Trade my sandals for my skis
Whispered warnings in the wind
Saying soon come the dancing snowflakes
They're kissing every tree
They're kissing you and me
Please hurry

Falling
Dazzling dancing diamonds from the sky
Prisms
Rainbow sparkled flurries in our eyes
Whipping across the frozen crystal meadow
Pond of ice
Race the snow
We'll build a warming fire there
And cuddle close and wine and dine
The setting sun
The morning light will find us high

Shooting down the glistening mountain side
Screaming through the whispering pines
The freedom of each day
Will cleanse our minds

I can hardly wait for the snow

Prettiest woman in the whole of the human race

Suddenly hopeless - hopelessly falling in love

I remember the way
She came and wrapped her arms around me
Told me that she cared
Said she'd always be there

Taking me places that I've never been

Was I just dreaming was it too good to be true

I was a man all alone in the night
She came along and she showed me the light
I was confused then she told me the way
I was alone and I begged her to stay

She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I awoke she was gone

So tell me one more time, how it's better for the both of us
Tell me one more time, how we'll hurt each other if we stay
Tell me one more time, my darlin' there's just one more thing
Before you walk away

Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you
Darlin' I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?

Now if I try, I can see the reasons why
Why we can't stay together
And I might convince my mind

But it's breakin' my heart to know I've got to let you go
To find that I must leave behind
The only love I've known

Well, I can tell myself that I never really needed you
I can tell myself that it's better just to say goodbye
I can tell myself a thousand lies but tell me now
Tell me how I do

Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you
Darlin', I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?

Say that I'll be better if we don't stay together
Say that I'll be better off free but don't say it to me

Explain it to my heart, tell me that I'm better off without you

Chicago,"I saw her once before; she didn't turn me on.
One night she stopped to talk to pass the time.
And then I saw her eyes; her softly smiling glow,
We sat and talked all night at Byblos.

She talked of feelings that I knew were true.
She painted me a picture using every shade of blue
It was light with laughter, at times it made me cry,
And now I'll never know just why I didn't ever try to hold her;

To squeeze her; to kiss her all night long, I never tried to please her. 
Then, soon she had to go;
I sat there all alone
And thought of things she said

The whole day through.
And then I realized,
I never took the time
To find out where she lived

Or where to call.
I thought that I would see her
The next night,
Anticipating how I'd set myself right. 

Then, I went back to Byblos;
I sat there and waited,
Feeling just a little nervous
And a little frustrated.

Then, soon, in she came, looking just the same
Oo, I could hardly wait to take her far from the game.
Then a person came in to the club
That I had to speak to

I explained the situation to her
And I thought she understood
But I guess she thought I was jiving her around
'Cause when I looked for her, this is what I found

She was rapping with a real good friend of mine,
He was happening, I guess it was his time.
I really couldn't blame him, cause he was sad and lonely too.
But just talking to her did me so much good, I knew she'd do him good too.

Then I went home and I got it on,
Sat down to write these words when I was finally alone.
And then, about halfway through I wondered if someone knew
Where she was, so I could give her a call,

It is better to light just one little candle
Than to stumble in the dark.
Better far that you light just one little candle,
All you need is a tiny spark.
If we'd all say a prayer that the world would be free,
A wonderful dawn of a new day we'd see...
And if everyone lit just one little candle,
What a bright world this would be.

When the day is dark and dreary
And we know not where to go;
Don't let your heart go weary,
Just keep this thought in mind...

Very unsuspecting
You caught my heart
Unprotecting me
Now I've fallen in love with you

Just when I thought
I was free and easy
You came along to me
Soft and breezy
Now I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love with you

And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man
Happy man

And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can't understand
Being a happy man

Be with me now
Love me forever
Leaving you lady
Is something that I'd never do
I've fallen in love with you

All of my life it seems I have waited
Now I can say all these words
I have stated are true
I've fallen in love with you
Fallen in love with you

But if I had to live without you,
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

I was more than a desperate man.

Somewhere in the dark right before the dawn
Like a light from down the hall.
Suddenly some old familiar music
Songs I know I've never heard before.
I gotta play along I can't refuse it
I hear the call.

We've all been so proud of our blindness
No kindness to share

[Chorus]
I used to cry for the lost
Until I had to turn away.
Then I looked inside, past the fool,
And found some deeper words to say
To bring us together.

We can make it better
We can make it right.

We hide behind the veil of our own success,
While we're following the rules.
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands
To the never changing truth.
Freedom needs to speak a little louder,
Justice needs to try her other arm.
Some of us could push a little harder
To sound the alarm.
And I see children marching
And I hear the drums again

I used to cry for the lost
Until I had to turn away.
Then I looked inside, past the fool,
And found some deeper words to say.
If we hope and pray,
It will come, give it half a chance.
Everyone, understand
In our hearts and our mind,
You know there's nothing left to hide,
We're already there.

I used to cry.
Cry for the lost I was walking away.
I used to try to find a reason.
Then I looked inside,
I used to mind every time I was walking away,
I gotta find what I'm feeling
To bring us together.

From Paris to the cold Atlantic shore

I won't regret the past

Here with me
Deep down in my soul now and forever
A candle for the dark, I keep you
Here with me
A story with an unexpected end

Through empty doors a mountain in the sky
The golden chain
The autumn treetops cast a northern light
Do you remember?

We have no common ground
Treasure lost will now be found
We can blame our wild at heart
From now and from the start

Remember feelings I have shown
Chasing dreams I've never done

Every day there's lovers giving up on love.
People say it's just a fact of modern living.

Did they mean it when they said it was forever?

Just bask in the glory.

""Oh Yeah"" like a man with condition
I wait for my heart to stop.
Stay down,
Got a plan hold that position.
You can't afford a flop.

Pack my suitcase
With my game face,
Take the same place,
And put away the dreams I had.
Let my hair grow,
Find some old clothes,
Let the world know
That my glory days were plaid.

I'm not asking for permission,
Are you ready for me to be me.
Just pass the ammunition,
This prisoner's about to bust free from chains.

For so long you told me to keep it familiar,
Just play what they all would find,
I can wear this blindfold, stick to your story,
But I gotta ask myself why.
And I play those songs!
For so many seasons,
Till I'm sure I'm losing my mind.
And I say, Oh no,
Gotta have a much better reason
To leave all my dreams behind.

Strangers,
Rearrange us,
Stay the same fate,
And become your favorite fad.
With the see-through,
I gotta be true,
I can't be you.

Till everything's unclear
Twist and turn your arm around
Until it is not there

Can you look inside yourself

Chicago Symphony Brass,"God rest you merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy!
From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tiding of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
""Fear not, then,"" said the angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might""

All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Chicago Symphony Brass,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Chicagoland Pops Orchestra,"O Danny Boy
O Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
O Danny boy, O Danny boy, I love you so.

But if ye come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And I shall hear, though soft, your tread above me
And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I will sleep in peace until you come to me.",Danny Boy [DVD],2006
Chicanas De Oro,"De tanto andar por la vida
Hijo de mi corazón
Me están pesando los años
El cuerpo se me cansó
Tal vez se acerque el momento
Que habré de decirte Dios

Cuando ya no este contigo
Quien tus mejillas besó
El que a veces te abrazaba
Y a veces te regañó
Recuerda que fue tu padre
El hombre que mas te amó

Si un día recuerdas al viejo
Que se preocupo por ti
Si de el quisieras un beso
Y ya no me encuentre aquí
A tu madre pídele uno
De tantos que yo le di

Allá en tu mas tierna infancia, yo en mis brazos te arrullé
Cuando a la tumba me lleves en tu hombro, hijo, 
Esa vez, vas a pagarme con una las mil que yo te cargué

Mira por donde caminas,
Que no resbale tu pie,
Procura seguir mis pasos
Donde firme caminé
Y evita topar con piedras
Con las que yo tropecé

Cuando extrañes a tu padre 
Que al cielo se fue con Dios 
Si quisieras abrazarlo
O demostrarle tu amor
Los besos que des a tu hijo
Allá los recibo yo

There's something going on
Dark people walking by
This morning is the day after the next
Escape my only dream
'Cause I'm the only one again

But life is better spent inside your world
Butterfly that sings
Causes me to fall once more
Tomorrow you are only half a friend
Machines control your mind
And neon strips above my head

Come tomorrow, come tomorrow
There's never been an answer
There's always someone else to follow
And you are coming down, and you are coming down
Giving me the reasons for your lies

And when you turn me inside out
Don't know what you feel or dream about
And then you take me upside down
Remember my face, my name, my town

When I think of god he knows my mind
I'm wondering what's wrong
What will the devil find
Tomorrow you will find there's no way out
With nowhere left to turn
There's no place left to hide from him

In a city made of sand
We found our way out
But without a helping hand
We're free

Turn me inside out
Don't know what you dream about
Take me upside down
Take me, take me
And you turn me inside out
Don't know what you dream about",Come Tomorrow,2007

And by my side you would always be
And then we'll be forever
And by my side you would always be

But far away now, the stars too high to reach
But ever after the light is always colder

There's nothing else to do
There's nothing left today
There's nothing here to hope for

Chichi Peralta,"Te va a pesar, hasta el haber nacido
Cuando sientas de pena,
Cuando pruebas de veras
El sabor del olvido

Te va a saber, cada beso fingido
Como el beso de Judas,
Más amargo que el llanto,
Pero muy merecido

Que me puedes decir de la vida,
Con el llanto, si nunca has llorado,
Que camino podrías enseñarme,
Que hace tiempo yo no haya cruzado

Te di mi amor, pero jamás mi olvido
Porque en cada caricia, estará mi recuerdo,
Bien prendido contigo,

Después vendrás, a pedir mil perdones
Pero ya sin quererte, como el beso de Judas
Te sabrán mis amores

Que me puedes decir de la vida,
Con el llanto, si nunca has llorado,
Que camino podrías enseñarme,
Que hace tiempo yo no haya cruzado",El Beso de Judas,2000

She never gave a damn
Delilah wasn't choosy
Till she fell for a swell buckaroo
Whose name was Sam

She gave him satisfaction
And he fell 'neath her spell
With the aid of love and ""hootch""

His true wife he did crave
Delilah she got jealous
And she tracked him and hacked him
And dug for Sam a grave

You can't involve the kids with our differences
And since memories are all we have
Don't you agree that all little kids deserve to laugh?

So regardless of color and race, we all is covered in grace
And you gotta be stronger than most

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1993
Chick Corea,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come,1994
Chick Corea,"Who said that money was everything
Well, that's a crock, you know what I'm sayin'
When the well runs dry 
Say goodbye to your fair-weather friends
If I need a hug 
And I feel like crawling under a rug
If I fell on my face
I know that you'd be there to help me up

'Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Ain't nobody gonna make me live my life alone

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old

You know, lovers they come and go
Like ships to a dock, a bunch of heartbreakers they are
They blind you with their innocence 
Tie your heart in knots
If I need some hope
And I feel I'm at the end of my rope
You make that funny face
You're always there to cheer me up

'Cause it's you, only you to take me along
Ain't nobody I'd rather have to help me sing a song

A friend won't leave me lying in the road

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel, 
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came; 
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel, 
""Let nothing you affright, 
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright, 
To free all those who trust in Him

From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind, 
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay, 
They found Him in a manger, 
Where oxen feed on hay; 
His Mother Mary kneeling down, 
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises, 
All you within this place, 
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;

All other doth deface.

Why can't I let you know,

Artists get cream turn fiend 
Selling people a dream 

Aiyyo  you rappers don't amuse me wit your crystals or oozies 
Industry groupies  living after movies 
They scarfaced my race  some support hate 
Lifes a court date  some die to escape so hold your weight 
You niggas brag too much  fuck wit us we bag you up 
And use the same clique that you thought would back you up 
It's nine eight eliminate bait and open gates 
Enough with chains and whips lets make brains eclipse 
We all claim we rich, hold thugs in crypts 
Forgot about the seeds growing up seven to six 
Fuck a Benz wit tints I got the razor prints 
Y'all rappers love idols there it is I'm convinced 
Burn my contract, mental combat 
And stomp your battle rap wit a Vietnam track 
Red and white Sadaam rap sippin Cognac 
I bet you didn't loopb know that the real Jews are black

God or the reverend? 
Your girl or your weapon?

Big cities a dream on the low is the scheme 
A fiend that clock green without jockin somebodys sting

Yo wuddup I, about ready to pull the rabbit out the top 
Platinum gold oops upside your knot 
Now nigga stop now nigga please 
You ain't really ready to roll them sleeves 
With your three degrees forty below nothin but recipes 
Tight jeans, hype and don't know what nuthin means 
Acting like you Billie Jean selling How to be a Fiend 
When your loves about black marketing a nigga for his cream 
And the big apple it ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled she's a queen 
From out of town wagging her swing 
All around with she glasses and women asses is what made men jack asses 
Everything including your company jacket 
And niggas asses for your ransom 
And next thing you know they got a nigga dancin 
Chancin him out of his advancements 
And how y'all gonna pay back these back taxes? 
This ain't healthy for your assets 
It's like your face done been bashed in your career ain't happning 
After the monkey wrenches and forks done been stabbed in 

Intruiging to the ear but bitter to the heart 
I begin to take part in The Art of Dart Throwin 
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsmen 
Raindrops fall the block remains hot 
Steam rises from the street which forms the clouds that I move through 
Renew my stainless sword style 
Allah has spoken the golden code of silence has been broken 
Mic terrorist shroom brew wickedness improves 
As I ascend and expand extend I seen men 
Fall from greats trying to trace the origin 
But there is no beginning or end to the lifeline 
Sunz of Man forever shine through the mic line

Of the bar code, he was more sold like Old Gold

I'll and hardcore ready for tour shakin breakin jaws 
Makin new laws open the doors healing my sores 
Blessing the poor, the art of war we less a boar 
Verse one we guard a star and the starting artist 
Another target on your market style is garbage 
You get bombarded whole clique slapped retarded 
Pussy harded mcs bleed slugs to the body 
It's physical domination lyrical laceration brutal termination 
When you fuck wit the federation, collaboratin wit my nation 
Discussing allegations conversating about the downfall of Satan 
Ghetto frustration keeps my head piece achin 
Constant motivation keeps my world in rotation

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Chick Webb,"We didn't break apart in stormy weather
We didn't run around like others do
Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather

Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailing, sailing
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We find each others arms in troubled waters
We found that's the safest place to go
From now we can laugh at troubled waters
'Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love grow

With blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Magee
And she tips the scale at three o three

Oh gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl
So big and fat that when you hug her
You don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a way and chalk a mark
To see where you began

One day when I was a huggin' and a chalkin'
And a chalkin' and a huggin' a way
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way 'round the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Nobody ever said I'm weak
My bones don't ache and my joints creak
But I, I grow absolutely limp
Every time I kiss my baby blimp, oh

One day I had a yen for some one leaner, she was meaner than a
Mink in a pen. So I left her now I'm happy as a fella could be
Huggin' and chalkin' in once a gain 'round my Rosie
Huggin' and chalkin' in once again

One day I was a huggin' and a chalkin' and a beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' a round the other side of the mountain
Comin' around the other side

of your kiss and your warm embrace child

that I been held to my lips now baby 
revealed the tears I had on my face

than to see you walk away from me

than to see you walk away from me",I'd Rather Go Blind,1980
