Richard & Adam,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found.
'Twas blind, but now I see.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we first begun.
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found.
Was blind, but now I see.",Amazing Grace,2013
Richard & Adam,"Ave Maria, gratia plena.
Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Ave, ave dominus,
Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus,
Et benedictus
Et benedictus fructus ventris,
Ventris tui, Jesus.

Richard & Adam,"God on high
Hear my prayer
In my need
You have always been there

He is young
He's afraid
Let him rest
Heaven blessed.
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home.

He's like the son I might have known
If God had granted me a son.
The summers die
One by one
How soon they fly
On and on
And I am old
And will be gone.

Bring him peace
Bring him joy
He is young
He is only a boy

You can take
You can give
Let him be
Let him live
If I die, let me die
Let him live
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home.",Bring Him Home,2013
Richard & Adam,"Qui dove il mare luccica e tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai
Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai",Caruso,2013
Richard & Adam,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live along before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

You say I took the name is vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah",Hallelujah,2013
Richard & Adam,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear the unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To write the unwritable wrong
To be better far than you are
To try when your arms are too weary
The reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless,
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Whithout question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world would be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable
The unreachable
The unreachable
Star

To dream the impossible dream
The reach the unreachable star",The Impossible Dream,2013
Richard & Adam,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love",The Power of Love,2013
Richard & Adam,"Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday there'll time for us
Time together and time to spare
Time to learn, time to care
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday, somewhere",Somewhere,2013
Richard & Adam,"Whoa, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh, ""Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me""

Whoa, my love
My darling
I've hungered, hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me",Unchained Melody,2013
Richard & Adam,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all",The Winner Takes It All,2013
Richard & Linda Thompson,"Those backstreet women, watch what you say
You turn your back and they slide away
They run next door, they give it all away
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

Gatemouth woman leaning on the fence
She's got no teeth, she's got no sense
You don't need much intelligence
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

Slide over here, slide over there
Spreading that scandal everywhere
Stab you in the back and they just don't care
Doing the slide

Now slander is a loving tongue
They speak your name to everyone
Never is a curse left unsung
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide",Back Street Slide,
Richard & Linda Thompson,"Remember, when we were hand in hand?
Remember, we sealed it with a golden band?
Now your eyes don't meet mine, you've got a pulse like fever
Do I take you for a lover or just a deceiver?

Simple is simple and plain is plain
If you leave me now you won't come back again
When the game is up, ah, don't renege on our love

No, don't renege on our love
Ah, no, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love

Well, give me just an ounce of sympathy
Give me my chains of liberty
There's a rope that binds us and I don't want to break it
If love is a healing why should we forsake it

Well, hunger is hunger and need is need
Am I just another mouth to feed
When the game is up, well don't renege on our love

No, don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love

When my heart breaks it breaks like the weather
If you leave me now it'll thunder forever
Oh, don't give it up, well, well, don't renege on our love

Ah, no, don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love

Richard & Linda Thompson,"In the dark, who can see his face?
In the dark, who can reach him?
He hides like a child. He hides like a child.
Keeps his finger on the trigger
You know he can't stand the day
Shoot out the lights. Shoot out the lights

Keep the blind down on the window
Ah, keep the pain on the inside
Just watching the dark. Just watching the dark
Ah he might laugh but you won't see him
As he thunders through the night
Shoot out the lights. Shoot out the lights

In the darkness the shadows move
In the darkness the game is real
Real as a gun. Real as a gun
As he watches the lights of the city
And he moves through the night
Shoot out the lights. Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights. Ah, shoot out the lights",Shoot Out the Lights,
Richard & Linda Thompson,"I hand you my ball and chain
You just hand me that same old refrain
I'm walking on a wire, 
I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

I wish I could please you tonight
But my medicine just won't come right
I'm walking on a wire, 
I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

Too many steps to take
Too many spells to break
Too many nights awake
And no one else
This grindstone's wearing me
Your claws are tearing me
Don't use me endlessly
It's too long, too long to myself

Where's the justice and where's the sense?
When all the pain is on my side of the fence
I'm walking on a wire, 
I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

Too many steps to take
Too many spells to break
Too many nights awake
And no one else
This grindstone's wearing me
Your claws are tearing me
Don't use me endlessly
It's too long, it's too long to myself

It scares you when you don't know
Whichever way the wind might blow
I'm walking on a wire, 
I'm walking on a wire

Richard & Linda Thompson,"Let me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time
Let me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time
You can waste your time on the other rides
This is the nearest to being alive
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall Of Death

You can go with the crazy people in the Crooked House
You can fly away on the Rocket or spin in the Mouse
The Tunnel Of Love might amuse you
Noah's Ark might confuse you
But let me take my chances on the Wall Of Death

On the Wall Of Death all the world is far from me
On the Wall Of Death it's the nearest to being free

Well you're going nowhere 
When you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong 
But what's the good of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy. 
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall Of Death

Let me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time
Oh let me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time

Richard & Linda Thompson,"Don't think my love is something that you can play with
I'm not the one to spend the time of day with
You learn to hide love, you lock it up or find it gone
You think you need me, you think you read me
From the beating of my heart

But you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Oh you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

If you should see a tear, you won't see many
If you should hear me sigh, it's not for any
If you should greet me as I am walking along
You only want to see just the shell of me
You don't know the other part

Well, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Ah, listening to the wrong heartbeat
I said, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

Oh you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Oh listening to the wrong heartbeat
Oh listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

Don't throw your secrets where men will steal them
You got to hide them, you got to seal them
No matter what you try, you'll never take my love from me
And if you might think that you can move me
From the beating of my heart

Oh you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Ah, listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

Oh yes you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat

Richard & Linda Thompson,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again

And still feel the silence as close as before
And was there a season without any rain,

O will there be nothing of peace â??till the end,
Or never, o never, o never again?

Oh, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
And once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
Oh, why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

So, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

Now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
It's once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
So why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

And where was the will of my father when
We raised our swords on high?
And where was my mother's wailing when
Our flags were justified?
And where will we take our pleasures when
Our bodies have been denied?

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

Richard Allen,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,

It's late September and

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.

The weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
Why'know I want to do it again

Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She's a big star
She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star",Big Star,2006
Richard Bennett,"All he could think about was I'm to young for this 
Got my whole life ahead 
Hell I'm just a kid myself 
How'm I gonna raise one 

All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke 
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast 
Oh well, those plans are long gone 

And he said 
There goes my life 
There goes my future, my everything 
Might as well kiss it all good-bye 
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later 
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator 
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl. 

Momma's waiting to tuck her in 
As she stumbles up those stairs 
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear 
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls 

He smiles 
There goes my life 
There goes my future my everything 
I love you, daddy goodnight 
There goes my life 

She had that Honda loaded down 
With Abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes and his American express 
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go 
She hugged the both and headed off to the west coast

Richard Bennett,"I asked my love to take a walk
To take a walk, just a little walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

I held a knife against his breast
As into my arms he pressed
He cried ""my love, don't you murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity""

I took her by her lilywhite hands
I drug her down to the golden sands
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down
I wandered home 'tween twelve and one
I cried, ""My God, what have I done?""
I've killed the only man I love
He would not take me for his bride

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

well the very next morn
bout half past four
sheriff's men knocked at my door
saying now young man
time to go down to the banks of the ohio",Banks of the Ohio,1997
Richard Bennett,"Six foot six, stood on the ground, weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds, 
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love.

He was the kind of man to gamble on luck,
Look you in the eye and never back up,
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup, because of love.

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands,
Like the wind it covers our land,
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man, this thing called love.
It can lift you up, it can put you down,
Take your world and turn it around,
Ever since time nothing's ever been found, stronger than love.

Some men are like me, they worry and doubt,
Trouble their minds day in and day out,
Too busy with livin' to worry about, a thing called love.

But then I see a mother's tenderness,
As she holds her young close to her breast,
Then I think by God this world was blessed, with a thing called love.

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands,
Like the wind it covers our land,
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man, this thing called love.
It can lift you up, it can put you down,
Take your world and turn it around,
Ever since time nothing's ever been found, stronger than love.

",A Thing Called Love,1998
Richard Bennett,"I've been walkin' in my sleep
Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
Where the years went I can't say
I just turned around and they've gone away

I've been siftin' through the layers
Of dusty books and faded papers
They tell a story I used to know
And it was one that happened so long ago

Chorus:
It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on the moutainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

Now, I hear the owl a-callin'
Softly as the night was fallin'
With a question and I replied
But he's gone across the borderline

The edge of night and the break of day

There's some TV show that you're missing
But you know how an old man loves to talk
And he needs someone who will listen

    Come and sit by the river with me for a while
    And I'll tell you a story that's true
    Of when I was a boy playing here on the shore
    And the grass was so green and the water so blue



Well our house stood right over there
Of course they took it down for the highway
I can see my moma's tears, we've been there for twenty years
And you know we would still if I had my way

 * Refrain


Many years I have watched this river flow
Rolling down from the hills to the ocean
I have seen the waters high, almost fierce and rushing by
I have seen in nearly dry and without motion



Now at last you can see what it has come to
Oh we prospered but poisoned the waters
Now the tunes have all been played and the piper must be paid
Not by us but our sons and daughters

Richard Beriach,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Hey love, long time no see
Been reminiscing the time you and I used to be we
Started off back in September
As far as I can remember
You gave me the option I found hard to endeavor
You wanted me to see long-term, but I couldn't
Stop hanging with those low-life brothers, but I wouldn't

All you were trying to do is show you were there for me

You could easily walk away, hold up the hand, straight dissing
But wait a minute, yo yo yo, hear me out
You'll soon realize brother's coming with a whole different route
We could hold hands and walk in the park
We could light up some candles and soothe down in the bath
I would be ready to listen to your plans about the car, villa
And okay meet your gran
Hey, I'm just joking, but to live without you is mind provoking
Ah man, I'm just saying hear the plan
I'm ready to understand
I'm ready to meet your fam

As far as long term, let me tell you what I see
My career blowing up, you beside, that's what I want, that's what we need
Pretty picture, don't you agree
You and I girl creating our own destiny
Hey let me ease back all my rhymes from your mind
Go home, think about it, sit back and recline
Take a minute or two, with all the plans you have for me
Are you sure you're now ready to be the one for me

Hot water in the bath
And the phone call that you promised me
I'd given up on last

I was only 22
All undone and overdue
My friends burned all around me
And the smoke was full of you
But let's stop here for a prayer
For what happened there
And let us have a beer
For anyone who's still here

I didn't leave a letter
I just wrote my baby's name
On the mirror all steamed over
With water, heat and shame

From the Hooker oak tree

Wrapped in my baby's towel

And I lowered myself down

And you can dry up bitter tears
But the first to pass right through you
Will age you fifty years
And you could say, 'well I don't know
You got to love just the same'
But I say all I got
Was a phone call that never came

The towel was lying open
And it hurt so bad
There was red smoke in the water
And all the things we'd had

Now that I'm dead and gone

A bouquet of shadows in the evening sun
I sat up late and watched you sleep

And off the hallway, dear, another trail of tears

Pressed all up against us
And it?s just as true, so far away
But I can be there by breakfast

I just drive on through to you
So as the past goes breaking by
Where are you tonight?

It?s 4 AM and I'm awake again
And not quite high enough
I?ll be back, you know when
Should I lie a little and dream away

I'm just lying here anyway
With a chill a little heat
Could kill on sight
But where are you tonight?

Wasted and well spent
Taken and once wrecked
Oh, you're better than this and that
I thought I was cured of any last chance

Unfastened and floored
Now all I want is
Just a little
Nothing more

I looked inside, the ring we wear
And I read myself to sleep
I caught myself, so captured there
Deep inside those cavern eyes

You've broken me
At the vow, below the vine
But where are you tonight?

Where are you tonight?
Where are you tonight?

Richard Buckner,"Tough is as she does
Won't you slump on over and stir my shuffle down?
For once, devotion is enough
But the walk you whittle, another dream, another drink
Over in the basement, not an inch between
I'm yours and I have to leave

Take care, you throaty fare
A shade away and a braid along
Shy a day or two of what I've done
What I said I wouldn't do
This poured out picker through a cold 750
There's a view I barely see

What if I just showed up tonight
While the crush is crumbling from the tule fog outside
Like the mark your line left without a sound
Let me in and lay me out

Two rooms of yours, one with the runner
And the other with the runaway
And vows abound in infidels
Waved along and swept away
",Ed's Song,1997
Richard Buckner,"Once upon a blue thing or two
Eyes in sight, the moon confused
We heard the sparks fly and we watched their lies
Some died in retreat, some in jealousy

You know boredom breeds, temptation in its wake
But do look at what temptation's done
The spirit is here in the hollow, a message at the bottom of the bottle
Oh, the sky tonight is gray, all the quiver and the quake

Reaching away goodbye rye
Been bled on down the road
But when the buzz was over, man
It was getting cold

The years are slow, so I lye low
Do you want your name to burn away?
Oh, but I decide, honey, will I ride?
Along and through and over you

Sleep shame, Reno's low behind in flames
So with your misty mist and your low land frame
Won't you sleep shame?

With years that pass without a word
I've never seen a moon so high
Her name hangs down from there, tonight

So, put your little hand away
I've seen such needy days before
On nights like this, my hope returns
Though, I may be miles away from her

A locket just for good luck
A pocket knife for long nights
And a sleepy little dreamer
With still, miles to go

27, take me home
And pour that last year down my throat
The days will fade and the nights will burn
Though, I may be miles away from her

I see her in the doorway
Staring a hole through it all
The first of many fits
And the last one was, man, the last one was

So check your lock and close your eyes
When you wake up, I'll be all right
Never tell them where it hurts
And keep your bullet, safe inside

The wind has wept and the sky is slurred
But we slept through the sunrise, too
I'm dreaming still of who you were
Though, I may be miles away from her

Richard Buckner,"It's almost true: You don't expect to follow, watching
What you do. I talked my way, half the night in
Overdrive, with nowhere else to stay: afternoons spent
Inside crashing on the shadows in the room, wrapped in
Your reigns. Gone along, you won't forget who's standing
Out of frame.

Kick and run:
It doesn't fall far from the road and someone's going to
Come.

Shake it out:
Remember what you'd wanted from the embers floating down.

Aren't you cold'

Standing by my window (curtained up and closed)
Yesterday. I let the door fly open, broken just the same.

What you've found on the other side.",Window,2006
Richard Buckner,"Ours to never learn the beginning of it all, 
Keeping you alone; almost-overheard voices that had gone
As far as they could go were ready to return, 
Waiting for the call sooner than they'd know, 

Missing by a night.
Did you hear it in the wind?
I couldn't make it down, cloudy, in the lights
Fading out and, folded in a letter that I found, 
Remembered just in time: forgetting to forgive
Never turning back around, 

Stretching at the seams, pulling back the hood, 
Forever as a gaze you didn't really mean, 
Stricken as we stood broken, as we made time for make-believe, 
Stealing when we should, what we couldn't give away.",Hindsight,2011
Richard Burton,"It's true, it's true, the crown has made it clear
The climate must be perfect all the year

A law was made a distant moon ago here
July and August cannot be too hot
And there's a legal limit to the snow here in Camelot

The winter is forbidden till December
And exits March the second on the dot
By order, summer lingers through September in Camelot

Camelot: Camelot
I know it sounds a bit bizarre
But in Camelot: Camelot
That's how conditions are

The rain may never fall till after sundown
By eight, the morning fog must disappear
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot
For happily ever after in than here in Camelot

Camelot: Camelot
I know it gives a person pause
But in Camelot: Camelot
Those are the legal laws

The snow may never slush upon the hillside
By nine p.m. the moonlight must appear
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot
For happily ever after in than here in Camelot

",Camelot (Reprise),1960
Richard Burton,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, 
The homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. 
All that was of value to me was in London. 
By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

Forever Autumn

Journalist
The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. 
The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, 
More and more people joined the painful exodus. 
Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, 
Their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. 

Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, 
And here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, 
Cutting through bridges as though they were paper. 
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, 
Had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. 
This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, 
Without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. 

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. 
I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. 
At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. 
At that very moment, it was raised, 
And I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

growing stronger and stronger would beat again

Richard Burton,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!",The Artilleryman and the Fighting Machine,1981
Richard Burton,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Richard Burton,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London,1981
Richard Burton,"At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way
And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it

A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilby, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilby came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving: rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilby feared there was a man inside trying to escape 

He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him before 
He could burn himself on the metal

Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)

Are a million to one, but still, they come",The Eve of the War,1981

Richard Burton,"It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.
Next morning a crowd gathered on the common, hypnotized by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous, disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated.
A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly heat.
People clawed their way off the common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep.
I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life, working eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight would sweep the common, and the heat ray was ready to follow.
In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the common to form a cordon.
That evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror that my home was within reach of the heat ray.
At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.",Horsell Common and the Heat Ray,1981
Richard Burton,"It's looking good, it's going good
We're getting great pictures
Hhere at NASA Control, Pasadena
The landing craft touched down on Mars
Twenty eight kilometers from the aim point

We're looking at a remarkable landscape
Littered with different kinds of rocks
Red, purple, how 'bout that, Bermuda?

Fantastic, look at the dune field

Hey, wait. I'm getting a no go signal
Now I'm losing on of the craft
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?

No, I lost contact
There's a lot of dust blowing up there
Now I've lost the second craft
We got problems
All contact lost, Pasadena
Maybe the antenna's

What's that flare? A green flare, coming from Mars
Kind of a green mist behind it

","The Red Weed, Pt. 2",1981
Richard Burton,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!

No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,1981
Richard Burton,"There were ships of shapes and sizes
Scatter out along the bay
And I thought I heard her calling
As the steamer pulled away
The Invaders must have seen them
As across the coast they filed
Standing firm between them
There lay Thunder Child

Moving swiftly through the waters
Cannons blazing as she came
Brought a might metal war-lord
Crashing down in sheets of flame

Sensing victory was nearing
Thinking fortune must have smiled
People started cheering
""Come on Thunder Child""
""Come on Thunder Child""

The Martians released their black smoke, but the ship sped on, 
Cutting down one of the tripod figures 
Instantly, the others raised their Heat Rays 
And melted the Thunder Child's valiant heart

Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing Heat Rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliverance
As we watched the sinking wreck
With the smoke of battle clearing
Over graves in waves defiled
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child! [Repeat x 2]

When the smoke had cleared, the little steamer had reached the misty horizon, 
And Carrie was safe
But the Thunder Child had vanished forever, 
Taking with her man's last hope of victory
The leaden sky was lit by green flashes, cylinder following cylinder, 
And no one and nothing was left now to fight them
The Earth belong to the Martians.

Richard Burton,"It's true, it's true, the crown has made it clear
The climate must be perfect all the year

A law was made a distant moon ago here
July and August cannot be too hot
And there's a legal limit to the snow here in Camelot

The winter is forbidden till December
And exits March the second on the dot
By order, summer lingers through September in Camelot

Camelot: Camelot
I know it sounds a bit bizarre
But in Camelot: Camelot
That's how conditions are

The rain may never fall till after sundown
By eight, the morning fog must disappear
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot
For happily ever after in than here in Camelot

Camelot: Camelot
I know it gives a person pause
But in Camelot: Camelot
Those are the legal laws

The snow may never slush upon the hillside
By nine p.m. the moonlight must appear
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot
For happily ever after in than here in Camelot

But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love

Then I went back up to Boston with absolutely nothing but a feeling

When you were the one who had made it so clear

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

Living with the good and the bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who Imagined it all
All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird

You had control of our smiles and our tears

There's a bump in the basement

There's a knocking on the wall

In the pumping of the pistons

I swear I heard your call

There's a bump in the basement

There's a hole in the floor

There's a guard in the garden

Locking up the door



There's a rumble in the floorboards

No shutting out the sound

And the workers are below me

Digging underground

Feel the building all around me

Like a wrap of armoured skin

But the more we are protected

The more we're trapped within



Tell it like it is

Till there's no misunderstanding

When You strip it right back

Man feed machine

Machine feed man


Tell it like it is

Till there's no misunderstanding

Make up what you like

Man feed machine

He's a stand-up guy, he's in an upright and locked position
He knows the basic programming language
He's the low man on the totem pole
He's Deep Gordon Brie

And now on drums, on skins, on the trap-set
The cocktail kit, the thing you that you hit with the thingies
He's a slick click to pick with a stick
He's back with another one of them block-rockin' beats
His middle name is Tom
He's ""cymbal-ic,"" we're talking ""brush with greatness""
He likes to bang the drum slowly if you know what I mean, and I think you do

Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss 
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight 

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential 

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you

Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight 

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around 

Pace yourself from me
I said maybe baby please
But I just don't know now 
When all I wanna do is try

Wasn't able to make it enough for you

Till you died, but you're still alive

You seem very well, things look peaceful 
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know

And you know you've seen it all
In daddy's car thinkin' you'll go far
Back east your type don't crawl
Play ethnicky jazz to parade your snazz
On your five grand stereo
Braggin that you know how the niggers feel cold
And the slums got so much soul

Richard Cheese,"Yo, VIP, let's kick it!

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for

Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

que me estás clavando
Y ya no sé qué hacer (y ya no sé qué hacer)
pa recobrar tu amor, y
que me quieras de nuevo
Día tras día, poco a poco,
nuestro amor, por tus desprecios,
se está acabando
Porque te digo aquí, y me dices que allá
Y si yo digo si, me dices que jamás
Y si quiero salir, tú te quieres quedar
No sé por qué razón, tú no me quieres ya

Te ofrezco besos, y me sacas vueltas
No te imaginas cuánto me duele
quererte tanto, y tú ya no me quieres",Tus Desprecios,1995

Richard Clayderman,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I have learned on the street
No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet
Will I wake up from this nightmare?
A fear that chills me to the bone
Though I may be one of many

I feel so all alone
We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night
Left by my father with only this scar on my face

Told by my mother that
""No, you were just a mistake""
I have tasted my own hunger
Sold my body to survive
Some have paid to scratch the surface
But they can't touch what's inside
We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

How I long for something better
Than this life I know too well
Lord, I know I'm bound for heaven
'Cause I've done my time in hell
We are the children of the night

Richard Clayderman,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All,1993

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love that I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Richard Clayderman,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2002

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night

At sixes and sevens with you

While those around you crawled 

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on a treadmill
And they made you change your name

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Is laid for your faith

Are his dread arms in fight

We tremble not we fear no ill
They shall not overpower us
This world's prince may still
Scowl fierce as he will
He can harm us none
He's judged the deed is done
One little word can fell him

The Word they still shall let remain
Nor any thanks have for it
He's by our side upon the plain
With His good gifts and Spirit
And take they our life

This is the girl, she's the one.

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it 
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart 

 Something's gone, I can't explain 
The heat is missing from the plain 
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain 
There's something wrong with you and me 
When more than one adds up to three 
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see 
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing

Between heaven and all that surrounds us 
We're travellers here, spirits passing through

As a whelp fast to the teat
She smote me then
We've ever since been shadows
Two beasts of one old soul

If you rely on the kindness of strangers
It helps to have a hound for a handmaid
Not only for the superior nose
Or companionship
Often people stop to talk with me
Having never seen before such a very beautiful snow-coloured collie

Working the fell a most powerful eye
Part of the grass, fast as lightning
Before the children were grown
They'd ride her like a pony
Through the nodding banners yesterday
She went in chase of a ship's rat
At my wit's end I finally located her
Under a whining bush, my poor old lady, seized by a fit

When the raiders came in their flaming carriages
She went running to her family
While I listened on, cowering behind a pile of drying logs
There's no denying it

I sold my shoes so I could buy a chicken
A penance and a treat on her final day

Now she is gone I carry her down to the sea
And scream at the sinking stars

To the mouth of the Hobthrush's cave
Undecanted the hot wine from a nanny's throat
And placed loaves on the greasy stones

Our baby's lips are blue
Our baby's eyes grow dim
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off - the whooping cough
And we'd be your eternal debtors

As the doorway drew near our eldest appeared
With a bundle in her arms
It was clutching her tresses and nuzzling her breast
And the colour was returned

I used to hold him in the palm of one hand
Now he's grown as tall as I am
With the face of his mother veiled in downy gold
On the broad shoulders of a man

He is strong with the second sight
In these parts held in some renown
Using words not his own he veraciously foretold
Of a drought when the stream was bulging

When the pictures become too real
He buries his nose in the bush of my beard
And gently pinches my earlobe between thumb and forefinger
Until the present is restored

At the murmur of dawn there's a knock at the door
And a small man standing by
He is wearing a dogshide and flies for a crown
One good eye a sparkling well in his brow
I'd already acquainted myself of that voice
Before he'd even spoke:

""I have come to collect what is rightfully owed
Rouse the boy from slept
Get him bathed and dressed
It is time he kept your end of the bargain""

The bargain",Hob,2017
Richard Dawson,"Fortune wags its tongue
Along the walkways of the bathhouse
They say the monk returned from Iceland
Unearthly boon in stow
He who possesses the Pin of Quib
Is granted eternal beauty

I am tired of men
Of kneading the knots from their bulbous backs and necks
And rinsing their filmy water
From this mew of tiles
When I heard tell of the Pin of Quib
Straight away I knew I had to hold it at all costs

A storm like a drum
Encompasses the priory
As I go on mouse-toes
Into the blind man's chamber

And leaning over his bed
I push the blade between his ribs
But then in a flash he's got my wrists
And he's pinned me to the floor

I wake up gagged and bound
To a windless ochre forest
The monk's wan face inches from my own
His breathe smells like pears

He asked me then
""would you like to see the Pin?""
Retching on his filth
I nod ""more than anything""

From inside his coat
He fishes a broache
A plain pea of stone
No bigger than a thumbnail

And I can hardly believe
How very ordinary it seems
Then it dawns on me
It was all mere folly

""Yes, now you see
The Pin's a pebble only
That which you so thirstily
Coveted over my dead body

Now it is yours to keep
You are it's custodian
But first I must have your eyes
Then the circle will be whole""

I once
Could see
But now
I am blind

And all sense
Of the world is

Richard Dawson,"In the kingdom of Bryneich
Verging on a muddy crook of Coquet
A dice of houses cast with clay and sheepdung
Through a soup of starlit peatsmoke
Gradually emerges as we descend

""Bring the goose my child!""
I carve a notch into the squirming post
It smells like a smithy
""Hurry now and drink the bowl before it congeals""

There comes frightful news from town
Of great evil abound
The heartbroken potter's idiot boy was snatched from the speltfield
Scouring a fortnight in the hills
All they found, pointing from a sett, a small grey hand

""Tie the goats to my cot
With tansy rags their faces cover
Push straws into the windows
Damp the coals, and bar the door with hornbeam limb""

Blinding colours leap
Along bemirrored tower walls
Stretching as far as the eye can see

I am woke in icy beads
By a clamour coming from the broadbeans
The snapping of stems and a foul-smelling bloom
Paralysed I watch my child's breath
Glide like a jellyfish across the black morning

When the sun is climbing
We'll find the harrow smothered in slime
When the sun is climbing
We'll put it in the dog's noses

When the sun is climbing
We'll break upon the heath
When the sun is climbing
We'll dash across the Ringing Meadow

When the sun is climbing
We'll weather a storm of living needles
When the sun is climbing
We'll tarry by the Pool of Plenty

When the sun is climbing
We'll hurry down the Valley of Eagles
When the sun is climbing
We'll hear the distance of the North Sea

When the sun is dying
We'll cross the Causeway of No Memory
When the sun is dying
Our trees will billow in dunes

When the sun is dying
We'll wade around the shoreline
When the sun is dying
The algae as a nap of fire

When the sun is dying
Below the surface of the water
When the sun is dying
In the face of the cliff a ghastly doorway

When the sun is dying
We'll pitch a tent of pigskin on the beach
When the sun is dying
The ebbing tide will soon reveal it's secrets",Ogre,2017
Richard Dawson,"There has to be more than this
Is there no reason for me to exist
But for as a plaything of miscreants, malingerers, dastards and knaves?

How is it so
A child can be bought for a year's worth of grain?
In this day and age
It's hard to explain but it happens again and again

I'll never forget the scene
Where the freckled jowls contort across my father's 
Face and disappear under thew wheels of the cart

Then the sky parts
Pillar of rain
It is my mother

In another life
If I ever had children of my own
I'd cleave them to my breast
And convey them far from this country of demons made flesh

My last bedfellow is choked to death on a dummy of puke
I stole this horse, Old Speckled Brownface
From the royal tannery
Haunches glossy with sweat
We burst through the birch
Turn our heads north
With dawn in our lungs we reach the border",Prostitute,2017
Richard Dawson,"I am come straight from the palace
Through the toadsong to your step
At the behest of the king
With a gift for your temple
I have lugged this strange contraption
Over many a hoary dale
Unbar the batw! Take me to the house
Of your so-called priest blasphemer!

""We do not require the use of your abandon
We have our own seeing-device, powered by waste
It no longer recognises words or numbers""

As a fellow citizen of reason
I strongly suggest you reconsider your position
Otherwise you may face truly dire consequences
The instalment of this modern wonder
Is for your own benefit
Down will rain boiling tar on your rooves, if you refuse

Somewhere fire cannot live a secret dome

Richard Dawson,"Leaving the path
Lured by an emerald
I wander into the Bog of Names

Now I'm stuck fast
Calves sorry henges
Glued with the silence of newts in the gloaming

My leather flask
Froze to my hand
Globelets of wine rubies on my chin

Away away
Through the soil
Alder roots will draw in me
To forge the bell of the tree
Peal! Away to the hall of clouds!

Out of the gloom
A figure approaches
Wrapped in a garment of northern light

Heaves me free
Gives me a potato
Escorts me to the edge of town then turns on the heel

Failing to hide
A tail striped
Following always the cusp of night

Away away
Through the soil
Alder roots will draw in me
To forge the bell of the tree

To the hall of clouds!",Shapeshifter,2017
Richard Dawson,"Here we are at the Fortress of Long Wings
My fellows bristling with anticipation
At slurp among their supperbowls
A map of steam in the rafters overheard

Shovelling it in
I don't taste a thing
Only a memory of
Kisses spilled upon my chin

I am tired
I am afraid
My heart is full of dread

I am tired
And I am afraid
My heart is full of dread

Even now on the evening of battle
I'm clammy with doubt of love
I'm really scared of going
How I yearn to hold you once again

In the morning we
March across the sea
To the sunken monastery
To face our faceless enemy

I am tired
I am afraid
My heart is full of dread

I am tired
I am afraid
My heart is full of dread

The rolling fields grow dark as the grave
And I am running for my life
Avowed to never draw another blade
I'll be back home just as soon as I can

Pack the horse and ride away
Find some better place where
We might raise a family

Richard Dawson,"I steep the wool in a cauldron
Of pummelled gall-nuts afloat in urine
Ad river-water thrice-boiled with a bloodstone

Then let it breathe
Under the beams
While I prepare the lichen

Half a fist of wizardbeard and rock-tripe
Yields a dye enough the whole town to paint
Lavenders an echo of the beeswing
Dazzling foxgloves ashake in the salty wind

It looks like a thundercloud
Suspended from the gables
High above the bobbing heads
Which now and then look up to see what's dripping on them

So we begin
Feeding it in
Combing through the fibres searching gently for a yarn to spin

My lady takes a nasty tumble
Down the crumbled steps of the merchants guild
Precipitating the early onset of labour

There is a crab
Caught in her hair
Stretchering through the market

Fearful are the bellows to behold
Even with the spindle firmly clenched between her teeth
With a snap the baby's head emerges
Onto these sodden eiderdown bedpages

Even though the new born child
Is not my kin
And still is dangling by a string
I ken the rising mystery of love

We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes
If mama don't know now, she can guess  
My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw
Children by the dozen in and out the bamboo hut 
One for every palm tree and coconut

À cent mille sous zéro et depuis cent mille ans
Peu importe comment le décor te programme
C'est toujours les tropiques quand tu aimes une femme

« Tout commença quand ils se sont perdus un jour
Le traîneau de secours s'est perdu à son tour
Le caribou couché dans la gueule du loup
J'ai pris de vieilles étoiles pour me faire un igloo »

Dans la toundra
Sursum corda

Pourquoi Alashuak me parle-t-il ainsi
Touriste de nylon, aliène que je suis?
Dans un ciel éclaté aux bouches des cratères
Je me demande si nous sommes encore sur terre

« J'ai bel et bien perdu la trace, me dit-il
Ne tentons pas la panique, c'est inutile
Je suis une légende et toi t'es une affaire
J'te donne l'éternité et tu me donnes une bière

Dans la toundra
Y'a des bons gars

Le petit point là-bas, qu'est-ce que c'est, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Un trou dans la glace? Un loup dans ma trace?
Ici, c'est comme ailleurs, c'est comme la mémoire
Tout ce qui s'éloigne prend la couleur du noir

Un météore blasé, un casino viking?
Une armée en déroute, quelqu'un qui te fait signe?
Ton ennemi juré qui te voit dans sa mire
Ou l'homme de pierre t'épargnant le pire?

Dans la toundra
Tu ne sais pas

Peut-être le beau temps découvrant la rocaille
Des animaux masqués en smoking funérailles
La pauvre kipaluk accouplée à son chien
Ils auront les yeux bleus, des dollars plein les mains

La carcasse de l'avion, le pilote aux yeux fixes
La cargaison d'alcool de l'hiver de trente-six
Ils l'ont tout' bue pendant que les bêtes passaient
Rappelle-toi, petit, la mort n'arrive jamais

Dans la toundra
'Est déjà là

Akinisi, aussi, je crois que je l'attends
Elle est passée comme une outarde au printemps
Si tu savais combien d'années il a fallu
Pour qu'elle vienne sur ma couche toute nue

Elle est sourde et muette et secouée de transes
Elle s'en fut se marier à un mur de silence
J'entends parfois la nuit sa prière électrique
Quel oiseau de malheur, ô quel chant magnétique

Dans la toundra
Kamasutra

Vous autres, vous dites que le monde est petit
Jamais pourtant je n'ai revu Akinisi
Le petit point là-bas, c'est peut-être le chasseur
Qui pose son fusil, le soir, près de son cœur

S'il ramène de la viande il aura de la peau
Et encore des enfants pour manger le troupeau
Qui s'en va, qui s'en va, qui s'en va
Akinisi, viens ici, dans mes bras!

C'est quand même incroyable qu'on soit encore vivants
À cent mille sous zéro et depuis cent mille ans
Peu importe comment le décor te programme
C'est toujours les tropiques quand tu aimes une femme

J'ai la trajectoire, la tension et la cible
Mon rêve a le métal des armes inadmissibles
Je mangerai les dieux tombés à mes côtés
Et je ne plierai que devant la beauté

Je sens déjà rouler le frisson sur ma nuque
Mon âme s'envoler dans un blizzard de sucre
Je savoure mon thé et je ferme les yeux
Mourir de froid, c'est beau, c'est long, c'est délicieux

Je me perdrai encore et encore, tant que
Je n'aurai pas trouvé cet être qui me manque
Pour célébrer cela, tu vas faire quelque chose
En arrivant au sud, tu m'envoies une rose

Ou au-delà »",Akinisi,1988
Richard Desjardins,"Par-delà les frontières
les prairies et la mer 
dans les grandes noirceurs
sous le feu des chasseurs
dans les mains de la mort
il s'envole encore
plus haut plus haut
le cœur est un oiseau.

Dans les yeux des miradors
dans les rues de nulle part
au milieu des déserts
de froid de faim et de fer
contre la tyrannie
il refait son nid
plus chaud plus chaud
le cœur est un oiseau.

Prière de ne pas déranger
Ferme la porte, je suis en ondes

Dans ses yeux

Le saumon rendu à la mer
Le prisonnier dans les bras de son père
Le goéland dans le dépotoir
La bijouterie, la barre de fer

Du rock n'roll sur ma misère
Le brochet noir dans le banc de ménés

Y'aura pas d'hiver cette année

Et me voilà dans de beaux draps
De beaux, de beaux, de si beaux draps
De la flanelle plein le cargo
Le piano joue tout seul, let's go

Sa main qui nage sous mon chandail
Et puis qui descend vers le sud
Près de mon palmier aïe! aie! aie!
Tiens, kiss my ass, la solitude!

La terre, la terre, mon capitan!
L'outarde au-dessus des douanes
La Rio Grande dans le dos
À moi, à moi, San Diego!

Et qui se tue
