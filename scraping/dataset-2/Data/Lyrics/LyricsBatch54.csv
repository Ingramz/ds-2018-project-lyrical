Chris Mills,"You're everything I every wanted
You're everything I ever needed
You're everything that was good in my life
How did things go so bad?

Well I could say I'm sorry
I tried to tell you I can change
But the words they get all twisted
They get rearranged

This love is gonna kill me
This love is gonna kill me
This love is gonna kill me
One of these days

Well I guess that you're leaving
I really don't know why you stayed
I guess it don't matter
What can I say

This love is gonna kill me
This love is gonna kill me
This love is gonna kill me
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days",This Love,2003
Chris Mills,"Trouble me no more stranger
Trouble me no more
You got what you were after
I got what I was waiting for
Cause you were looking for a sucker
And I was ripe for a lesson
So just leave what you have broken
And trouble me no more",Trouble Me No More,2003
Chris Mills,"I dreamed I was Richard Pryor
Running on fire down the Sunset Strip
And as the flames burned brighter, my head grew lighter
And I watched the flesh fall from my fingertips

Ashes to ashes
Trust to dust
I don't know what it means
To be burned by something that you love so much
I think I must be living the dream
I know that I am living the dream

I dreamed I was the pilot
Of a ship lost out at sea
And as my eyes filled up with blood
My ears rang with cries of mutiny

Ashes to ashes
Trust to dust
I don't know what it means
To be blinded by something that you love so much
I think I must be living the dream
I think that I am living the dream

A flock of birds flew from my mouth
And as I fell to my knees
I could hear those hollow bones
All echo back to me

Ashes to ashes
Trust to dust
I don't know what it means
When you try to hold on to something you can't touch
I think I must be living the dream
I think that I am living the dream",Chris Mills Is Living the Dream,2005
Chris Mills,"Dancing on the head of a pin
Dancing on the head of a pin
Sleep our days away on the edge of a blade
But at night we all go out
Dancing on the head of a pin

All we want is to love
And to be loved in return
But for every breath you take
There's a heart somewhere that breaks
And a promise that's come all undone

Because we're dancing on the head of a pin
Dancing on the head of a pin
Sleep our days away on the edge of a blade
But at night we all go out
Dancing on the head of a pin

As sure as the sun will rise
Or the rain does fall
Love will find a way to make a king into a slave
Or a man into a child

Just dancing on the head of a pin
Dancing on the head of a pin
Sleep our days away on the edge of a blade
But at night we all go out
Dancing on the head of a pin
Dancing on the head of a pin",Dancing on the Head of a Pin,2005
Chris Mills,"Stars are falling from the sky
And virgins all from the parapet
With arms outstretched, they have leapt
They are tired of waiting
For a groom they know will never come
Now that the King of Kings has gone out of his head
He's whispering to fools in their beds
And giving them the power

And it's late, but it's not too late
We can still make our escape
I've tunneled beneath the subway line
So take a last look from the corner of your eye
At the city lights all fading

Now that the sky has come crashing to the ground
And we've played back all the black boxes we found
On the corner kids are moving to the sound
Of history repeating
So say goodbye to all that you love best
And hope we find it all again somewhere out west
For in these skyscrapers united we will stand
Only in our isolation

And I'm high, but I'm not that high
If we had a car, I think I could still drive
From here to the Berlin Wall
Or the bottom of the ocean

And it's late, but it's not too late
We can still make our escape
And though it's sad, it's not that sad
For soon the memories of the hard times that we've had
Will be like city lights all fading",Escape from New York,2005
Chris Mills,"Daddy, won't you tell me
Everything about the heart?
Where it stops and where it starts
And where to let it go
Won't you tell me
So that I will know?

For it has loved a girl
And it has loved a boy
It has been set fire
And it has been destroyed
But still I hear it beating
Like that song you used to sing me all the time

I just want to know
If love is real

Is it high or is it low?
Is it fast or is it slow?
Or is it never-ending
Forever spinning like a wheel?

So, daddy, won't you tell me
Everything about the heart?
Where it stops and where it starts
And where to let it go
Won't you tell me
So that I will know?",Everything About the Heart,2005
Chris Mills,"Lover, lay your weapons down
And wipe the blood from around your mouth
And let the armies of my heart
Beaten but still beating
Go silently retreating in night
There is no common ground left for to fight
So, lover, lay your weapons down

You soldier, you captain
You've seen so much action
I know our bed is only ashes now

But I can't believe
How you could bear to see
All those fresh-faced boys with copper coins across their eyes

They came with looks to kill
But all they learned how to do was die
So, lover, lay your weapons down

Lover, lay your weapons down
And let the bodies all be found
Naked, burnt, and twisted
Tattooed hearts upon their wrists
And passion forever frozen in their mouths
At least now we know what love is all about
So, lover, lay your weapons down
Lover, lay your weapons down",A Farewell to Arms,2005
Chris Mills,"I think I've seen you
Or maybe I've been you
I don't know how deep
I just know I've been in you
By the touch of your lips
Or the way that your slip
Hangs from your ancient frame
And I've been waiting my whole life
Just to love you again

I've wasted nights on the Spanish canals
Like a fool, trying to sail from your memory somehow
But now I can see
It was not up to me
It's all been some master plan
And I've been waiting my whole life
Just to love you again

As for the girls in the gas station bathrooms
Or on top of the Eiffel Tower
I know I said that I loved them
And I did
But I've been waiting my whole life
Just to love you again

For there is no earthly aspect
To match the beauty of your eye
No countenance so full from light within
And though I've spent endless ages
Trying to deny it
I've been waiting my whole life
Just to love you again",In the Time of Cholera,2005
Chris Mills,"Martha, will you please be quiet?
Can't you see that I'm trying to sleep?
I know, though you have told me
That our love is growing cold
We're not the first ones to trade passion
For a little bit of peace

And, Martha, will you please stop crying?
The neighbors are beginning to talk
You say our love is dying
But I find it very trying
To try and conjure up nostalgia
For something that never was

So go on, Martha
Find a better life if it is out there
Go on, Martha
And sing to me the miracles you find
And I'll be here waiting for you
When you've found that all your dreaming
Was just a waste of time",Mothra (Will You Please Be Quiet),2005
Chris Mills,"This weather's got to change
Because I'm so tired of the rain
I know it makes the flowers grow
But tonight, it just makes me said

And I miss the summer sun
And you in your summer clothes
Your face pressed against the sky
Sunlight dancing on your shoulders

Maybe this is but a dream
And the winter some sad hour
In the middle on the night
When your heart's lost all its power
But you know you can't give up
You know you can't give in
Because when the morning comes
Everything that is black
Will be blue again

This weather's got to change
Because I'm so tired of the way
The wind will lift you up
Just to knock you down again

But when you can't go on
And you just want it to end
You know all you have to do
Is close yours and pretend

That this is but a dream
And the world some sad hour
In the middle of the night
When your love's lost all its power
But you know you can't give in
Because when the morning comes
Everything that is black
Will be blue again",The World Some Sad Hour,2005
Chris Mills,"Lover, lay your weapons down

Chris Mills,"Give my regards to the atom smashers
The king of all monsters and the man of tomorrow
Give my best to the plantation masters
And the captains of industry

Kiss for me sweet Virginia, hold for me Miss America
And give my love to the Statue of Liberty
Give my regards to the nuclear family
The five-percent nation and the Salvation Army
Give my best to the wizards of Wall Street
And the dragons of the KKK
Kiss for me Hitler and Tojo
Hold for me Dorothy and Toto
And give my love to all those statutes of bigotry

Tell my eyes I will miss them
Tell my hands I forgive them
And tell my heart
My heart's coming with me

Give my regards to the suicide bomber
The patriot actor and the trust fund folk singer
Give my best to the corporate rock soldier
And the Gitmo softball team
Kiss for me the heavy-handed metaphor
Hold for me the self-referential troubadour
And give my love to all my brothers
And sisters in mediocrity

Tell my eyes I will miss them
Tell my hands I forgive them
And tell my heart
My heart's coming with me",Atom Smashers,2008
Chris Mills,"Blackbirds flying backwards on the wind
Filling sails of sailing boats
That won't sail home again
Four and twenty wings upon the night
Somewhere a lover sings a song with no reply

Fireflies on fire in Mason jars
You hung them from the trees
And pretended they were stars
A thousand little lights all in your eyes
But in the morning, all those little lights had died

And now the phantom blood of memory
Fills the vessel of your pale white cheek
But is the apple of your cloudy eye
The one you sent away or the one you left behind?

He walked you down the lane and back again
Underneath the garden wall
You buried soldiers made of tin
And though the other boys were all so cruel
He was the one that you played for a fool

Minutes made of moments, days of hours
They covered him in chains
And they locked him in a tower
But in the dead of night, he'd coax the dove
To deliver you a gentle song of love

And now the phantom blood of memory
Fills the vessel of your pale white cheek
But is the apple of your cloudy eye
The one you sent away or the one you left behind?",Blackbirds,2008
Chris Mills,"I woke up last night, I turned on the light
But the room just kept spinning
I thought I heard you scream, but you were fast asleep
And I knew what you were dreaming

Your face looked like the moon, reflected in a spoon
And outside a chorus of June bugs was singing
We are all just waiting in the wings

How could I forget the night that we first met?
I was playing in the parlor
You begged me for a song, and when I got it wrong
You said you were the master's daughter

Then underneath the moon we began to spoon
While outside a chorus of June bugs was singing
We are all just waiting in the wings

And though we thought the evil empire
Would be returned into sand
It seems now all our battles were in vain
But if the half-light from this half-life
We are living goes disappearing
I know that our love will still remain

Now we're on the run with our sabers and our guns
Waiting for the final hour
When love will play its hand and the overlords of man
Will be stripped of all their power

Imprisoned on the moon, our comrades sharpen spoons
While their chorus goes rising to the heavens
We are all just waiting in the wings",Calling All Comrades,2008
Chris Mills,"I can't believe I made you cry
I don't know why I did that
I didn't mean to do that
But you turned your head
And you closed your eyes
I'm so sorry that I made you cry

And I can't believe I made you laugh
I don't know how I did that
I wonder how I did that
You tried so hard just to hold it back
But I caught you when I made you laugh

You, my girl, are the whole world
The sun, the moon, the stars up in the sky
And I was just a little leaf upon the wind
I'm so happy that you found me
When I came floating by

And I can't believe we fell in love
I wonder how we did that
I'm so glad we did that
Because now I am your only one
But I still can't believe we fell in love",Can't Believe,2008
Chris Mills,"We took the antidote, oh, it was a bitter pill
It rearranged the past
Made us forget how we used to feel
The poison was a part of us
It made us who we were
Now we're just faces and names
And numbers on a calendar

Now I've realized
There's more to life than just being alive
We're living in the aftermath
I don't know how, but at least we survived

And when I look back on the way we used to be
Sometimes I almost miss
All the drama and the tragedy
'Cause blood is a funny thing
The more you lose, sometimes the more you gain
You just have to know when to stop
Because there's no life in an empty vein

And now I've realized
There's more to life than just being alive
We're living in the aftermath
I don't know how, but at least we survived

So I hope you're well, sleeping warm in somebody's arms
And that you forget all the things we said
when we were doing each other harm

Because now I've realized
There's more to life than just being alive
We're living in the aftermath
I don't know how, but at least we survived",Living in the Aftermath,2008
Chris Mills,"If it can't move you
It'll move right through you
It's gonna tear us all apart
Until there's no one left
To put us back together

It wants to beat you
Crush and defeat you
It's gonna tear us all apart
Until there's no one left at all

There's something out there on the wing
Face full of sparks and flashing teeth
I think it's trying to bring us down
Am I the only one who sees what's happening?

Tell me, can you hear it
The sound of yourself disappearing?
I saw it out there in the dark
Face full of fire and electric sparks
It went and tore us all apart
Now we've all been torn apart
And there's no one left to even know we're gone","Nightmare at 20, 000 Feet",2008
Chris Mills,"It took forty days and forty nights
To get myself feeling right
The desert in my head was dry as a bone

I followed breadcrumb trails and Christmas lights
Street signs and satellites
Even shouted your name through a cheap megaphone

'Cause you burn like something that burns
And you sing like something that sings
There are no words to describe such a beautiful thing

I crawled my way through empty streets
Over parking lots and movie seats
Picking up clues in the threads of my coat

I found a letter from my future self
And true to form, it was little help
'Cause these useless lines were all that I wrote

You shine like something that shines
And you ring like something that rings
There are no words to describe such a beautiful thing

Finally I caught a break
A treasure map in a birthday cake
Two crossing lines revealed you to me

And standing by your bedroom door
I knocked three times and then once more
'Cause I knew that luck was but one thing I'd need

'Cause you burn like something that burns
And you sing like something that sings
There are no words to describe such a beautiful thing",Such a Beautiful Thing,2008
Chris Mills,"It started with words in a bar on a late winter's evening
By the first flush of spring, sides were chosen
And lines were drawn
The red summer sun set on fields of banners waving
And the autumn leaves fell like bodies
From the battlements
We dug in, played to win, for we knew
Our cause was righteous
It did not matter that we knew not what it was
For the radio said that the lives of our wives and babies
Were under attack by vampires and aliens

In the mud, we suffered the frost and the cannon fire
As generals fed on the breast of the war machine
Commanding us to die for their gilded pleasures
While maggots ate all of our rations clean
A thought like a thread sent out
From beneath the Atlantic
Carried news of the fast-approaching enemy line
As my lips drank deep the blood of a terrible monster
I recognized two dead eyes and a face like mine

We broke ranks, smoked and drank
In the heart of an unholy city
Traded chocolate with children
Hid Vermeers beneath our coats
Made love to the whores on the steps of the Tower of Babel
And woke with steely blades pressed to our throats
A thousand years in a cage, we thought ourselves forgotten
Prisoners of something we did not understand
When word finally came that the fighting all was over
Though we could return, we could not go home again","Untitled, No. 1",2008
Chris Mills,"Could you make me honest as the day is long
And could you tear down a fortress
A 1000 blue eyed girls strong
Cause I'm tired of waiting
Yeah I've had all that I can take
But I swear that if I'm wrong about you
You're gonna be my last mistake

I used to want to be a star

Yeah I melted down your ring
And I put it in my shoe
And now with every step I take I think of you
So you can punch my clock
And I will clean your plate
But I swear that if I'm wrong about you
You're gonna be my last mistake

I used to want to be a star","1,000 Blue Eyed Girls",1998
Chris Mills,"Well the sky goes on for miles
But you go on forever
You see my mark upon you
A circle and a feather
Well the feather is my heart
And the circle is forever
Well aren't you the one?
Aren't you the one?
Aren't you the one?
Aren't you the one?

Ever since we were born

In the shape of an angel

Well the snake saw the days I lived
And the angel she is regret",Aren't You the One,1998
Chris Mills,"I got the keys in the car but I can't get it started
I got a map and a needle
Still can't find where your heart is
But it's getting late
And I'm feeling lit
And the city there's just too much of it
And too little of me to care
Unless I got lost somewhere along the way

Sitting in the dark two miles from an exit
I've got all the tools, just don't know how to fix it
Under the hood and you're behind the wheel
Still don't know if you're being for real
Well you just sit there and stare
Must have got somewhere along the way

And the phone calls
They keep pouring in
Yeah your boss wants to know where the hell you've been
But there's nobody there
We must have got lost somewhere along the way
Along the way
Along the way
Along the way
Along the way",Chenoa,1998
Chris Mills,"Can you keep it under your hat?
I've got a truckload of secrets
Can I trust you with that?
You're looking at me the way that I look at you
And you know how I am

It's always like that with me
It's always like that
Like that

We'll used to back but I turn around
Come lay beside me face down on the ground
You said you could take it
Don't think you'll make it when this whole thing is through

You'll be my shadow
Will you give me the slip?
Let me hid my ever deep inside your hips
Do you change things
If you say I never do the same thing for you

It's always like that with me
It's always like that
Like that",Crushed Out,1998
Chris Mills,"I'm taking all your favors to the bank
I'm building boats of the bones of your good friends
Your hearts in your throat
And your wallet's in the tank

And all the books I never even read

Here's to you

Stupid and bold
Grey like a summer's day is cold

Walking on needles
Tripping on tongues
Can't stop talking about things I've done
Didn't mean no harm
Don't doubt me

I've got a fresh young mouth
Burning like a furnace
Don't it flower on your lips
I've got a fresh young mouth
Just wish that I could shut it

We could have an affair to remember
I'll be May and you'll be December
Don't you think I could walk you home tonight?
Always seem to be saying the wrong thing
All I want is a telephone that rings
We could take it easy
We could take it slow
We don't have to worry we could keep it on the down-low

Ignorance and death

And giving them the power

And we've played back all the black boxes we found
On the corner kids are moving to the sound
Of history repeating

And hope we find it all again somewhere out west
For in these skyscrapers united we will stand
Only in our isolation

And I'm high, but I'm not that high

And it has been destroyed

Is it fast or is it slow?
Or is it never-ending
Forever spinning like a wheel?

Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Chris Montez,"I was runnin' through the summer rain, try'n' to catch that evenin' train
And kill the old familiar pain weavin' through my tangled brain
When I tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop I didn't see
That police man said, ""Mister Cool, if you ain't drunk, then you're a 
fool.""
I said, ""If that's against the law, then tell me why I never saw
A man locked in that jail of yours who wasn't neither black or poor as 
me?""
Well, that was when someone turned out the lights
And I wound up in jail to spend the night
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds.
Well, I woke up next mornin' feelin' like my head was gone
And like my thick old tongue was lickin' something sick and wrong
And I told that man I'd sell my soul for something wet and cold as that 
old cell.
That kindly jailer grinned at me, all eaten up with sympathy
Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear,
""If booze was just a dime a bottle boy, you couldn't even buy the smell""
I said, ""I knew there was something I liked about this town."" 
But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down.
'Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds
Well, they finally came and told me they was a gonna set me free
And I'd be leavin' town if I knew what was good for me
I said, ""It's nice to learn that ev'rybody's so concerned about my 
health."" 
(They were obsessed with it) 
I said, ""I won't be leavin' no more quicker than I can
'Cause I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand
And I don't need this town of yours more than I never needed nothin' 
else.""

Now that you're here, ain't you
Proud of your peers
And the long way you've come'

The doorway to freedom so close to my hand
Voices behind me still bitterly damn me
For seeking salvation they don't understand

Lord, help me to shoulder the burden of freedom
And give me the courage to be what I can
And when I am wounded by those who condemn me
Lord, help me forgive them; they don't understand

Erases the footprints I leave in the sand
And I'm free to travel where no one can follow
In search of the kingdom they don't understand

Chris Montez,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""

To carve up and covet they wait there alone
Keeping the secret the rest have forgotten

Stranded like dogs in a star-spangled manger

Surely the death of so grand an illusion
Left us with legends too great to ignore

Lost in the wonder they came to explore.

Chris Montez,"Silver was a rounder with a wicked reputation
Music was his magic and his madness rolled in one
It's said he charmed the fairest hearts of this world's fairest maidens
Quick as silver mercury and slippery as a song

Winding like a river through a thirsty world of strangers
Carving out a legend in a dream-forsaken land
Silver took his pleasures just as freely as he gave them
'Cause hungry eyes weren't quick enough for Silver's flashing hands

Then, once upon escaping from the world of silk and shadows
Sudden growin' sicker of the secrets and the shame
He stumbled onto something real that beckoned like a candle
And never lookin' backwards, he surrendered to the flame

Because Hunger, is the surface of a darkened pool of sadness
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul

Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses
And Silver took it easy as the closing of a door

Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows
Following the line between her laughter and her lies

But Silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms

[Chorus]

Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise

Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find

And Silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day
And Silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away

And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he had written, I saw that he was about a step away from dying, and I couldn't help but wonder why.  And the lines of this song occurred to me.  I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted, and he's got him a good woman.  And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped showed me how to beat the devil.

It was wintertime in Nashville
Down on Music City Row
And I was looking for a place
And to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whiskey
But my hunger needed beans
But it had been a month of paydays
Since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty
And a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually I'd guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling
And sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
I saw that there was just one old man sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
And he turned and said,
Come up here, boy, and show us what you are
I said I'm dry, and he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said,
It's a tough life, ain't it?
I just looked at him
He said, you ain't making any money, are you?
I said, you been reading my mail
He just smiled and said, let me see that guitar
I got something you ought to hear
And then he laid it on me

If you waste your time a talking 
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying
Who do you thinks gonna hear?
And if you should die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Who do you thinks gonna care?
There were other lonely singers
In a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
‘Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know

Well the old man was a stranger
But I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out
On the wrong side of the door
When no one stood behind me
But my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't want to join him
You gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil
But I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song

And you still can hear me singing
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying
Praying someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Hoping someone's gonna care

A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run

By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand

There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

That died there in that desert sand so long ago

It’s the same old story

Your heart belongs to someone else and yeah
You get that you fought, you cried, you did everything
Everything for nothing

I will take back everything that we built together
I’m here I’m leaving to a better side where I can be myself again
I saw the past through your eyes
You won’t see me again

When the drink is in, the wit is most definitely out
Late bars, fight starts, between my brother and I
Get kicked out so we hold tight and take it outside

Dodging cars, new scars, fighting out on the road
Knees me in the chest my head and ass hits the floor
Swallowed tongue, what we done, someone's hand in my mouth
Got to pull it back out on a bank holiday Monday

Street fighting
Yet some day
You get out

But we share the same bed in my mam's house tonight

Chris Murray,"I want to talk to you today about Moon Records,
I sent them a tape that I had made about a month ago.
I said that the band is breaking up, I'm trying to go solo,
The man on the phone called back to say, that Mr. Bucket said no.

He don't know if the rude boys, like you boys,
Will like my stuff, but he know
The one man show will never go
And the tape it sounds too rough.

I know it's true, they'll never like what they never get to hear,
It's been that way for ska over the years.
But why should the ska world cover its ears
To the sounds of my blood, sweat and tears?

When I want to play ska,
I want to play ska for all of you.
I want to play ska for all of you,
Cause ska is what I do.

And so I've come down to New York to demonstrate to you,
That Venice Shoreline Chris is paying respect to the roots.
So clap your hands, sway your hips, get into a soulful groove,
Hear this music straight from my heart to you.

I want to play ska,
I want to play ska for all of you.
I want to play ska for all of you,
Cause ska is what I do.

I want to play ska,
I want to play ska for all of you.
I want to play ska for all of you,
Cause the ska is what I do.

One everything, and we are one with it.
There is one everything,

The selfish inaction are divided and controlled.
Clutching and clinging to the things that they can hold,
Fixated by fraction, distracted from the whole.

There is one everything, and we are one with it.

That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym

Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

And I die each time you leave 
I don't want to believe 
Lyric without your love 

I'm not the man I used to be 
Not the stranger that you see 
I been waiting for so long 
For a lover such as you. 
Never thought it could be true 
That a love could be so strong 
And they say that love is blind 
But you're always on my mind 
Every moment I'm awake 
And the thoughts I have of you 
Are so beautiful and new 
Oh my darling

And breaking up my heart 
Baby I don't wanna live 
If we're so far, far apart

I'm with you
You make me promises but baby they're not true
Whispers in the night that keep me hanging on

You walk into a room and you light up the place
You speak the words of love we're standing face to face
You got me on a string, I'd give you anything

And as for heartaches and as for mistakes
I've had my share but baby I don't care

You leave me breathless whenever, you are near
I feel so helpless, a hopeless situation
Oh, and everything depends an you
There's nothing else that I can do
You leave me breathless, I try to play it cool
But I'm so restless, there is no explanation
Oh, I hear the sound of my heartbeat
I'm breaking down each time we meet

Some people talk of you, they don't know how I feel
Sometimes I hear your name, I'm in a spinning wheel
You are a part of me, you are my destiny
I wanna hold you
I wanna touch you
Can't get enough oh I need your love

You leave me breathless whenever, you are near

She said, I suppose you've heard about Alice
Well, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
I could hardly believe my eyes

In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

The streets is so cold, it's hard to hold a smile
I'm in the hood and I’ve been pushing blow for awhile
And things ain’t looking up, niggaz is in denial
And I ain’t seen no better days beyond all the trials
I walked the church isles and prayed for God's hand
To lead me through the jungle cuz imma lost man
Still no response, damn been through a lot fam
And all I’m searching for is peace up on the blocks and
All I see is murder Dope fiends and Johnny law
And niggaz struggling, please believe it man I've seen it all
If you a ghetto product and you've got it hard
This one’s for you cuz it ain’t easy being who you are

Murder and drug abusing, Alcohol and prostitution
The streets are not protected under America’s constitution
Got cops and criminals and they both can't seem to stop the shooting
So we hit the 40 and the blunt like now we got solutions
Bullet holes I stop signs, crack sells I got mine
But can we stop crime so our mothers stop crying?
D-Eazy yeah I got us, we both them ghetto products
I love the ghetto so don't ever let the ghetto stop us
Don't let me get some paper cuz I can do some good
If I get rich then I gotta give back and I’m gunna give to the hood
To all my ghetto people, keep your chin proud and high
Cuz all you gotta do in life is just stay brown and die

It makes me wanna say
Oh, Oh Oh

I've been to California and Phoenix Arizona
It's all the same struggle nigga just a different corner
We see an OD daily out in Espanola
G the struggle never stops it's like it's taking over
It's hard to stay sober when you know you're living greasy
The hood ain’t all that shit you niggaz see on the TV
Believe me homie none of y’all out there wanna be me
This life we lead ain’t easy ask Reno Beazy
I make a little money but everyday it's spent
And with the price of gas it's hard for me to pay the rent
Livin’ that check to check ain’t never been easy
Fuck a nine to five cuz I grind cuz minimum wedge will never allow me to find a
Way out of this struggle and suffering
So my mother and sisters stop worrying that I’m hitting the streets and hustling
Customers keep on coming in dozens and have to pay
But that's the ghetto and it keeps you trapped until you pass away

Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
Through these years and these tears just the same

Got that old fashioned fate in my heart
And nothing can tear us apart
Dry land may turn to sea but there'll be no change in me
Got that old fashioned love in my heart

Chris Opperman,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me/To Return to You,2005
Chris Owen,"I was up all night
dreaming of you
Pretty valentine
Bleeding again from the sole of her shoes
Cause she's got to carry the weight of the truth

Would you take it easy on me
Would you take it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could

I was up all night drinking of you
We got into a fight
Love always drains the life out of me
But I can't complain
I'm in the deep freeze

Would you take it easy on me
Would you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Keep me in line through the grace of your heart
Keep me alive through the grace of your heart

I got up alright
Breakfast for two
Pieces of hate all over the room
Your love is a light that leads to my soul
That's melting the wall,
That's drowning me, so

Would you take it easy on me
Could you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart
The grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Swallow my pride through the grace of your heart
Buried alive through the grace of your heart
Love has no pride
Love has no pride

Shorty I wanna know if you come over
If you don't mind girl put your legs over my shoulders
Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes

Let's get on express way, let me tease you ma
And while you drive baby, I wanna taste your tongue
Pull in to rest here, and let me give you some
You ever been driving while your man made you cum
I wanna hit a stay, I wanna hit and run
Let's pull the car over, and have a little fun
The AC working, so we ain't gotta bun

Can I lick it, can I stick it, can I touch it, can I grab it
Baby tell me can I have it
Can I rub it, can I flip it, can I hold it, can I get it
Anyway I wanna get it

If that don't work for ya, I got another idea
Ain't nobody home, so come on over here
Let's play hide and seek, in our underwear
I find you, I can get it right there
You find me, then I get bare
Either way we both win, now that's fair
Whatever I gotta do to be with you Oh Yeah
You my queen, I'm your king, now that's a nice pair

Your first test is, can you get it hard
Show me how good you communicate when we start
Today's pop quiz, define your hot spot
Wanna see how good your balance is on top
Give you a A+ if you don't stop
This a big test, you looking kinda shocked
Either you get promoted, or you get dropped
Your final exam, show me your wet box
Ain't no tattle teller, I keep my mouth locked
Make you an honor student, show me you back shot
You passed with flying colors, oh that's a nice watch

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation

Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

I didn't know what to do or where to go to
I was in a really dark place
The answer was here all along
And that's why I wrote this song
To tell you about my Jesus and my faith
The stories in the Bible
And about the grand love that Jesus has for us all

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Said once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

I try to ignore it but I know she's in there my friend

Time goes by, so easy it sleeps away
Just like a shadow at the end of the day

Hello friend, how are things for you these days?
Some guy from way-back-when, he mentioned your name
Did he ever get back to you?
Ah, you know I told him to

Sometimes I turn and I swear I hear you call
And I often wonder how we lost what we knew
Seems it gone in the wind, washed away in the rain
And the years go by and by

There's one every night from my old school yard days

One golden rule

There's been times I've been stood in the wind and the rain
Freezing and busted and tricked out of luck
And I cursed my teachers for all of their reading

I see it all like it was yesterday
The ships and bridges they were all delivered
From Sydney harbour to the Cisco bay

And I met my love down on steel river
We served our dreams and spent our childhood days
In rainy streets we'd kiss away the shivers
And hide from fear inside the latest craze

Dancing to Motown
Making love with Carole King record playing
And oh how I loved you
Say goodbye steel river

Ten thousand bombers hit the steel river
And many died to keep her running free
And she survived but now she's gone forever
Her burning heart is just a memory

And I ran away from life on steel river

The odds were low the chances nearly zero
A chance it was I had to take

They say it's good to see them back again

And say her last goodbye

Bows and bangles on her fingers
And silver bells on her toes

That lady has music where she goes

Married a guy with prospects
And so became his wife

She could have made the scene

Satin winds floating down
Change the crystals on ladies faces

Laden gutters, flowing over
Hit the streets and explode

With that girl of mine

And I'm standing in the twilight now
Yeah I'm standing by her side

Made my way through the troubles sometimes

It would be so nice living in the limelight
It was 1999 right I never saw it coming

Been so many years since I looked back 
I know that it's this music makes me look at my life 
In a different perspective to many studio sessions
Got my music obsession without no musical lessons
Learned to play punk rock listened to other lessons

Hey, young homie what you trippin' on
Looking at life, like how did I get it wrong,
Life's too short, gotta live it long,
To my brothers and sisters, when will we get along
Hey, young homie what you trippin' on
Looking at life, like how did I get it wrong,
Life's too short, gotta live it long,
To my brothers and sisters, when will we get along

Give peace to the war in the streets,
Give peace to the evil that creeps, yeah,
I just ride, put my hand to the sky,
Live life like I'm never gon' die,
See we be fighting and fussing over nothing,
So much destruction, looking like puppets,
Combusting like nothing, now listen,
It takes education, to change your reputation,
From bad to good, you're gettin' better now you're elevating,
They be singing, family's hanging, everybody's chillin'
Not gonna stop this, living on the feeling,
Man this is the real thing, tell me can you feel me,
Wait 'til they drop this, dancing on the ceiling

Hey, young homie what you trippin' on
Ah, what you really trippin' on,
Life's too short, gotta live it long,
To my brothers and sisters when will we get along,

Been practicin' for thirty years
I should have walked a thousand miles

Reachin' out for that same old piece of forbidden fruit I slip and fall and I knock my halo loose 
Somebody tell me what's a boy supposed to do?

I get so clumsy I get so foolish 
I get so stupid And then I feel so useless
But You're sayin' You love me
And You're still gonna hold me
And that You want to be near me
'Cause You're makin' me holy
You're still makin' me holy, yeah

I'm gonna get it right this time
I'll be strong and I'll make You proud
I've prayed that prayer a thousand times

And I can never,no never,be good enough 
And that You're not gonna let that come between us

A breaching whale, a shooting star
Give testimony that You are
And my soul wells up with hallelujahs

Oh praise Him all His mighty works
There is no language where you can't be heard
Your song goes out to all the earth

O thunder's boom and Saturn's rings

There is no language where you can't be heard
Your song goes out to all the earth

Chris Rice,"Grass is always greener on the other side
The search is never over in the pastures of my mind
Is the meaning of happiness drowning in smiles
Or that dreadful world I left behind?
O Lord grant the grace to accept who I am
Who I am, that You have designed

I know there's a plan that you have up your sleeve
Rabbi, teach me the faith to believe
It's the only way my life will ever make sense to me
Oh, la-da-da, la-da-da, la-da-da

I can never measure, â??cause better things are all around
I'd be bitter and chained to the beauty I never found
But the strength of my Lord's love, it shatters the scale
And its depth gives a new peak to climb
And it grants me the grace to accept who I am
Who I am, that You have designed

I know there's a plan that You have up Your sleeve
Rabbi, teach me the faith to believe
It's the only way my life will ever make sense to me

And my resting place is taught by love
It's the only peace I know of, oh I know of

So when my heart is beaten by the standard of the law
I just remember Jesus, and I've found my favor with God
â??Cause the fire of my Lord's love it burns up the scale
And its depth gives a new peak to climb
And it grants me the grace to accept who I am
Who I am, that You have designed

Chris Rice,"Lazy summer afternoon
Screened in porch and nothin' to do
I just kicked off my tennis shoes
Slouchin' in a plastic chair
Rakin' my fingers through my hair
I close my eyes and I leave them there
And I yawn and sigh and slowly fade away

[Chorus]
Deep enough to dream in brilliant colors
I have never seen
Deep enough to join a billion people
For a wedding feast
Deep enough to reach out and touch
The face of the one who made me
And oh the love I feel and oh the peace
Do I ever have to wake up?

Awakened by a familiar sound
A clumsy fly is buzzin' around
He bumps the screen and he tumbles down
He gathers about his wits and pride
And tries again for the hundredth time
'Cause freedom calls from the other side
And I smile and nod and slowly drift away

[Chorus]

'Cause peace is pouring over my soul
See the lambs and the lions playin'
I join in and I drink the music
Holiness is the air I'm breathin'
My faithful heroes break the bread
And answer all of my questions
Not to mention what the streets are made of
My heart's held hostage by this love

And these brilliant colors I have never seen
I join a billion people for a wedding feast
And I reach out and touch the face

Chris Rice,"Well the moon moved past Nebraska
And spilled laughter on them cold Dakota Hills
And angels danced on Jacob's stairs
Yeah, they danced on Jacob's stairs
There is this silence in the Badlands
And over Kansas the whole universe was stilled
By the whisper of a prayer
The whisper of a prayer

And the single hawk bursts into flight
And in the east the whole horizon is in flames
I feel thunder in the sky
I see the sky about to rain
And I hear the prairies calling out Your name

I can feel the earth tremble
Beneath the rumbling of the buffalo hooves
And the fury in the pheasant's wings
And there's fury in a pheasant's wings
It tells me the Lord is in His temple
And there is still a faith
That can make the mountains move
And a love that can make the heavens ring
And I've seen love make heaven ring

Where the sacred rivers meet
Beneath the shadow of the Keeper of the plains
I feel thunder in the sky
I see the sky about to rain
And I hear the prairies calling out Your name

From the place where morning gathers
You can look sometimes forever 'til you see
What time may never know
What time may never know
How the Lord takes by its corners this old world
And shakes us forward and shakes us free
To run wild with the hope
To run wild with the hope

The hope that this thirst will not last long
That it will soon drown in the song
Not sung in vain

And not a single beat is lost
You can hear the chorus in the fields
Taking up where we left off

And Your praise goes on, rising to Your throne
Where You guard us while we dream
Past the stars they fly, Your praises fill the sky
'Til You wake us with the dawn

Now bring your warmth, O morning sun
Chase the stars and the moon away
And wake us with your brightest song

Flap your wings and leap for joy!
Oh forest lift your arms and sway!

Clap your hands you ocean waves!

Where You bless our toil and play
Through the clouds they rise, Your praises fill the skies

Why I trust in a love that my arms won't reach
I don't need You, don't need You, to prove it to me

He lays his Bible open on the table next to me
And as I hear his humble prayer
I feel his longing to be free someday

With the wind in our faces
Been watchin' the waves roll in
And it feels like we're sailing
Now Russell chimes in with his youthful imagination
""What if we saw him there
Walking out on the water?""
No time for splashing around in shallow theology
He just invited me out into the deep simplicity
And I'm sailing with Russell
Chasing that heartbeat
Playing on sunshine

And floatin' in the freedom
And thankin' the Savior

Filled with some crazy days
Been sailin' our separate ways
Across the blue ocean

As the events of the day
Keep burning deep in your mind
Why can't you leave them behind
And there's no one there in the dark
To share the ache in your heart
But no matter where you are
You're not really alone

Somebody's watchin', ain't missed a tear you've cried
Somebody's watchin', even the dark can't hide you
Somebody's watchin' you, you know that
Somebody's watchin' you

A million thoughts in your head
Toss you around in your bed
As the night drags on
Without a warning you're drawn
Into a childhood memory
Of a God Who never sleeps
Is He still lookin' down on me?
Does He really care?

Chris Rice,"The church's one foundation 
Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
She is his new creation 
By water and the Word. 
From heaven he came and sought her 
To be his holy bride; 
With his own blood he bought her, 
And for her life he died. 

Elect from every nation, 
Yet one o'er all the earth; 
Her charter of salvation, 
One Lord, one faith, one birth; 
One holy name she blesses, 
Partakes one holy food, 
And to one hope she presses, 
With every grace endued. 

Though with a scornful wonder 
We see her sore oppressed, 
By schisms rent asunder, 
By heresies distressed, 
Yet saints their watch are keeping; 
Their cry goes up, ""How long?"" 
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song. 

Mid toil and tribulation, 
And tumult of her war, 
She waits the consummation 
Of peace forevermore; 
Till, with the vision glorious, 
Her longing eyes are blest, 
And the great church victorious 
Shall be the church at rest. 

Yet she on earth hath union 
With God the Three in One, 
And mystic sweet communion 
With those whose rest is won. 
O happy ones and holy!

Like them, the meek and lowly, 
On high may dwell with thee.",The Church's One Foundation,2001

Here there by Thy great help I've come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Wandering from the fold of God

Interposed His precious blood

I shall see Thy lovely face
Clothed then in the blood washed linen
How I'll sing Thy wondrous grace
Come, my Lord, no longer tarry
Take my ransomed soul away
Send Thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless day

Set the time machine to 1975
We'd just found out that momma's gonna have another kid
Back in the 8th grade

Remember the days when life was not so mysterious
Follow me down the hall to the cafeteria
Where the worst thing I could mess up
Was dipping yesterday's corn dog in last week's ketchup
Back in the 8th grade

Why does the past always seem safer?
Maybe because at least we know we made it
And why do we worry about the future?
When every day will come just the way the Lord ordained it
You can believe it, yeah, just like the 8th grade

Step out into the hall and feel the moment pass
Slam the locker, there's the bell, we're runnin' to class
'Cause Mr. Jackson told us,""Don't be late for geometry again""
We're back in the 8th grade

I drop my books, sit down and mess with my hair
Suzie looks at me and smiles, I'm walkin' on air
Then I hear my name, I missed the question, I mumble somethin'

Maybe because at least we know we made it
And why do we worry about the future?
When every day will come just the way the Lord ordained it

Chris Rice,"Looked out my window last night
From my pillow and I
Saw the willow weepin' a causal sigh

Man in the moon looked rather
Sad and confused as if he'd
Become a mirror into my watery eyes
I dreamed and prayed through the night
Please send some grace with your mornin' light

Then he sent you along like a summer day
With a blue sky smile on your funny face
And a bird flew by singin'
?Everything's gonna be ok, yeah?

So we laughed all day with the man in the moon
And we thanked the good Lord for the afternoon
'Cause he showed me His love by sendin' me you
And it's ok now, everything's ok

I opened my window tonight
Hear the rain fallin' light
Whispering that everything's alright

Long, low, and gentle rumble
Starts in the west and tumbles
Across the corners of the colorless sky
I blow a kiss through the dark
Sails on the thunder and reaches Heaven's heart

'Cause he sent you along like a summer day
If a blue sky smile on your funny face
And a bird flew by singin'
?Everything's gonna be ok, yeah?

So we laughed all day with the man in the moon
And we thanked the good Lord for the afternoon
'Cause he showed me His love by sendin' me you
And it's ok now, everything's ok

Becky loves Jesus and really wants to make Him proud

She's got a Bible by the bed, a prayer journal, and a fish on her car 
She makes sure to bow her head and give thanks in every restaurant 
But is that enough? 

c'mon Becky, let's go for a ride 
If I'm driving too fast then I apologize 
But there's a world out there that we left behind

Looks like a reckless road, and a sacrifice 
And I'm crazy scared it may cost our lives 
But then I remember Jesus died 
So c'mon Becky 
Let's go for a ride 

I'm rolling up to Becky's house on my Sunday drive 
I have to laugh to myself 'cause it looks exactly like mine 
I smile and wave at all the happy people strolling by 
We've got the same walk, same talk, and the same sparkle in our eyes 
'Cause we're thankful for the blessings, but maybe we could lay 'em aside 
I get a feeling we might be missin' the time of our lives

Chris Rice,"Sweetest days of childhood, playing in the deep woods
Stomping through the creek and feeling, oh, so much alive
We're camping in the forest, we join the cricket chorus
And hum our songs of gratitude around a crackling fire

And out here in the stillness, I found my house of worship
With column trees and canopy of stars, here in my cathedral

It was beneath the blue skies, I ran down to be baptized
I felt the river wash me clean and dried beneath the sun
And to this day believing I'm wide awake or dreaming
Scan the ancient sky and understand where I belong

'Cause out here in the stillness, I find my house of worship
With column trees and canopy of stars, here in my cathedral

This is where I find my soul, out where holy men of old
First knelt in soil and thanked you for the rain
Wrote the songs that filled the air, herald angels sang their prayer
Out beneath your darling constellations
So let me off and wander, robin song and thunder
Surrounding me with stained glass leaves that change with every breeze

With column trees and canopy of stars, here in my cathedral",My Cathedral,2003

Feels the cold and hears the thunder cry

To be the answer to my prayer

And carried far away
And precious blood has washed away the stain, so

And remember when you walk
Sometimes we fall, so
Fall on Jesus

And steep and filled with pain
So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then
Cry to Jesus

And music fills the night
And when you can't contain your joy inside, then
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus and live!

And with your final heartbeat
Kiss the world goodbye
Then go in peace, and laugh on Glory's side, and

Just look how it brings us together like this
We all have a longing inside
And it keeps us singin' song after song after song

We're all waiting for the best song ever
It's somewhere out there, and everyone can feel it
We keep waiting for the best song ever
And when it arrives the whole world is gonna hear it
Yeah, the best song ever
Someday we'll all be singing it together

Chris Rice,"Was it a million miles to heaven
Too far to hear my lonely song
Or is it just my imagination I hear you humming along
I only hold you in my dreams now
I wake up with cold and empty arms
Lord help me get through this long night without you
And soon as the morning comes
Soon as the morning comes

Save me a seat at the breakfast table
Save me a dance around the Milky Way
And save me a thousand years to whisper in your ears
All I've wanted to say
Save me a smile and an angel's feather
Save me a walk down the streets of gold
And baby, we'll change our minds just like old times
And maybe we'll just fly away
Or maybe we'll stay

My lucky doll, you're in heaven before me
You were my taste of heaven here
Remember we loved to talk about it, we couldn't wait to get there
So you go on and find your way around now
But remember I'm here missing you
Do me a favor and say hey to Jesus
And tell him I'm missing him too
Tell him I'm missing him too

Then save me a seat at the breakfast table
Save me a dance around the Milky Way
And save me a thousand years to whisper in your ears

Chris Rice,"Saw an old guy today
Staring long at a chess game
Looked like it was half-played
Then his tear splashed between
The bishop and the king...oh
He turned his face to mine
I saw the Question in his eyes
I shrugged him half a smile and walked away
It made me sad, and it made me think
And now it makes me sing what I believe

It was love that set this fragile planet rolling
Tilting at our perfect twenty-three

But hope still breathes and truth is always true

Sugar-white perfection
Radiant beams of purest light

He's the master of reflection
Somehow he knows and imitates
My heart's expressions
Some nights he's melting in clouds of tears
Or shining my smile like the bright sun
But look, tonight the moon looks like
He's missing someone

For happy ever after
'Cause nobody knows what's coming
So why not take a chance on loving?
Come on, pour the glass and tempt me
Either half-full or half-empty
'Cause if it all comes down to flavor
The glass is tipping in my favor

Life gave me lemonade, and I can't imagine why
Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
I live life without pretending
I'm a sucker for happy endings
Thanks for the lemonade
Thanks for the lemonade

Now, take your time to answer me
For the beauty of romancing
Is to calm your trembling hand with mine
While begging love to fill your eyes
I can hardly breathe while waiting
To find out what your heart is saying
And as we're swirling in this flavor
The world is tilting in our favor

Life gave me lemonade, and I can't imagine why
Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
I live life without pretending
I'm a sucker for happy endings
Thanks for the lemonade
Thanks for the lemonade

I've got it made
Rest in the shade
And hold my love
While God above
Stirs with a spoon
We share the moon
Smile at the bees
More sugar, please
He really loves us after all
We're gonna need another straw

Chris Rice,"I heard a rumor that love will make you crazy
Well is it true?
Well that's no rumor, look at the crazy things that love made Jesus do
The friends he chose were thought to be outrageous
And you could even find him touching the contagious
And the craziest is how he chose to save us
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
""Gotta love the same way that I love you!""

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
Ã???Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

What the world needs now is for love to spread
As fast as the rumors do
But to make it, we gotta take this thing from another whole point of view
We can start by keeping our vows, and not breakin' promises
And bring hope to the women at the well, and the doubting Thomases
And you kids, you gotta cheerfully do what your pops and your mama says
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
""Gotta love the same way that I love you!""

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

Well I'm tellin' you boy, you got a lot to learn
I think you're crazy all right to love for nothin' in return
You've lost your marbles, got a few loose screws
And if you count your cards I'll bet you got less than fifty-two
But now you got me thinkin', you sorta planted a seed
'Cause you know this might be just the kind of love that I need
Naw, your train's off the track, you're from the loony bin
You know that brain that you ordered? Well it never came in
Or else you've fallen on your head and all your brains leaked out
'Cause your lights are on, but ain't nobody in your house
Your elevator doesn't quite reach the top floor
I think you're out in left field, and I could say a lot more
But you don't care what I think, it doesn't matter what I'm tellin' you
You got the love of Jesus, and he's the one compellin' you to love
Like he does
You gotta love like he does
You gotta love like he does
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy",Love Like Crazy,2005

Rise from your eastern bed
Stretch and yawn, now it's time to shine
And chase our shadows west
Burn in your pathway across the sky
And brighten up our stories
Wake the continents and oceans to
Another blessed morning!

You are the gift, you are the proof
The Lord looks down and warms my roof
You are the light, you are the sign
That I am loved and life is mine

You even played a part
On history's saddest day
You closed your eyes and the world grew dark
While the Father hid His face
And then two more circles around the world
To weep and wait for glory
And then you rose to show the way
On Resurrection Morning!

And the girls are all staring her down

But it might as well be real
Because I think I might be fixin' to drown

She understands anyway

I said can you show me around
I'll be bound to
Tell me what brings you to heaven today
I've always wondered what the fuss is all about
I feel like a kid flashin a fake id
Tryin to slip past the authority

Now I'm sneakin' into heaven
With a borrowed halo
Hopin' no one notices my broken wing
Peekin through these gates and thinkin lord have mercy
I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me

Hey Mr Pedro
I have a little confession
I don't belong here
And this halo isn't mine
Peter laughed
And said Lord happened to notice
We've all been broken
But now we'll do just fine
Cause nobody's good enough
But up here we're all the same
We all get to heaven
On someone else's name

Sneakin' into heaven
With a borrowed halo
Hopin' no one notices my broken wing
Peekin through these gates and thinkin lord have mercy
(2 times)
I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me
No, I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me
I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me

Chris Rice,"The first thought through my sleepy head
When I fell outta my bed is I hope the sky is gray
I'm gonna write a sad song today
So I make up my mind, slip on my shoes
I'm gonna pick up a paper and read the news
'Cause I'm sure to find enough blues to write my sad song

But when I open the door and the sun spills through
Takes away my breath and I think of you
And the only blues to hit my eyes
Are those beautiful blues in the clear blue sky

So much for my sad song
So much for my sorry attitude
Let's make this a love song instead
'Cause I'm so in love with you

Come on, let's go out and play
Save the sad song for another day
No time for tears, I'm wearing a smile
So much for my sad song
So much for my sad song

So I pick up the news like I said I would
Drop my jaw right where I stood
'Cause the headline reads, ""All the news is good
Because love is on the way""

And love floods the world right before my eyes
Everybody is dancing and slapping hi fives
And such beautiful music fills the sky and we all sing along
And now I snap out of my daydream
And I can't believe how real it seems

But I keep on dancing anyway
It's turning out to be a beautiful day

Sometimes I measure my day
By how many things go my way
And when things go wrong I usually get mad
But this time I'm glad my song didn't turn out sad
",So Much for My Sad Song,2007
Chris Rice,"Start with an infant world and an open sky
On a perfect day, breath from the mouth of God
Sends a quiver through His design of clay
And it is good, and it is good

Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Wake to a girl beside
Here's a hand to hold and never go away

Now taste the forbidden fruit
Make a poor excuse
Feel the wall of shame
And run and hide, and run and hide

Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Child in a manger bed
See the virgin smile, she understood

Now grow up and break your bread
Pour your cup of wine
On a cross of wood
A cross of wood, a cross of wood

Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again

Time twenty centuries
There's a boy on his knees
At the river's edge
Now plunge with his guilty stains
In the cleansing waves
And wash his sins away

Oh, happy day
Oh, happy day
Oh, happy day
Oh, happy day

Tell me that story again
Tell me that story again
Tell me the story, tell me the story
Tell me the story, tell me the story again

Start with an infant world
And an open sky on a perfect day
",Tell Me the Story Again,2007
Chris Rice,"What A Heart Is Beating For (Lyrics)



By Chris Rice

Leave it alone, don't analyze
'Cause love can be your lullaby
But love can be your hurricane too
And love can take your breath away
But love can leave you lonely and blue
Oh, what's a heart to do?
Oh, what's a heart to do?

Why be afraid
No reason to hide
Take the chance
Put it all on the line
Draw in a deep breath and throw open the door
'Cause that's what a heart is beating for
Yeah, that's what a heart is beating for
Beating for, beating for

Brace yourselves, take a good look around
We've all been thinking upside-down
That love's about what life can bring our way
Oh but love isn't love unless someone pays
And so with love, the only way to gain
Is give it all away
Is give it all away!

Why be afraid
No reason to hide
Take the chance
Put it all on the line
Draw in a deep breath and throw open the door
'Cause that's what a heart is beating for
Yeah, that's what a heart is beating for
Beating for, beating for
",What a Heart Is Beating For,2007
Chris Rice,"You're all smiles and silly conversation
As if this sunny day came just for you
You twist your hair, you smile, and you turn your eyes away
C'mon, tell me what's right with you
Now it dawns on me probably everybody's talkin'
And there's something here I'm supposed to realize
'Cause your secret's out, and the universe laughs at its joke on me
I just caught it in your eyes, it's a beautiful surprise

When did you fall in love with me?
Was it out of the blue
'Cause I swear I never knew it
When did you let your heart run free?
Have you been waiting long?
When did you fall in love with me?
When did you fall in love?

Make your way over here, sit down by this fool, and let's rewind
C'mon, let's go back and replay all our scenes
You can point out the hints, the clues, the twists and the smiles this time
All the ones that slipped by me
I bet my face is red, and you can hear my heart poundin'
Well I guess it don't matter now that I realize
'Cause baby I missed it then, but I can surely see you now
Right here before my eyes
You're my beautiful surprise

When did you fall in love with me?
Was it out of the blue
'Cause I swear I never knew it
When did you let your heart run free?
Have you been waiting long?
When did you fall in love with me?
When did you fall in love?

Was it at the coffee shop
Or that morning at the bus stop
When you almost slipped, and I caught your hand
Or the time we built the snowman
The day at the beach, sandy and warm
Or the night with the scary thunderstorm
I never saw the signs
Now we've got to make up for lost time
And I can tell now by the way that you're looking at me
I'd better finish this song so my lips will be free

Have you been waiting long, when did you fall in love
I kept you waiting so long, when did you fall
Have you been waiting long
When did you fall in love with me
When did you fall in love?",When Did You Fall [Acoustic Version][*],2007
Chris Rice,"So called reality right there on my TV
If that's how life's supposed to be
Well, somebody's lyin'
The camera's on and we can tell
To keep your fame you have to yell

'Cause tensions build and products sell
And we're all buyin'
I hope we're smarter than this

Everybody take a breath
Why are all your faces red?
We're missin' all the words you said
You don't have to yell

Draw your lines and choose your side
?Cause many things are worth the fight
But louder doesn't make you right
You don't have to yell, oh
You don't have to yell

I tuned in to hear the news
I don't want your point of view
If that's the best that you can do
Then something's missin'

And experts on whatever side
You plug your ears, you scream your lines
You claim to have an open mind
But nobody's listenin'
Don't you think we're smarter than this?

Everybody take a breath
Why are all your faces red
We're missin' all the words you said
You don't have to yell

Draw your lines and choose your side
Many things are worth the fight
But louder doesn't make you right
You don't have to yell
You don't have to yell

Everybody take a breath
Why are all your faces red
We're missin' all the words you said
You don't have to yell

If everyone will take the step
Back away and count to ten
Clear your mind and start again
We won't have to yell

Draw your lines and choose your side
Many things are worth the fight
But louder doesn't make you right
You don't have to yell
You don't have to yell

Chris Rice,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in thee, 
Let the water and the blood, 
From thy wounded side which flowed, 
Be of sin the double cure, 
Save from wrath and make me pure. 

Not the labors of my hands 
Can fulfill thy law's commands, 
Could my zeal no respite know, 
Could my tears forever flow, 
All for sin could not atone, 
Thou must save, and thou alone. 

Nothing in my hand I bring, 
Simply to the cross I cling, 
Naked, come to thee for dress, 
Helpless, look to thee for grace, 
Foul, I to the fountain fly, 
Wash me, Savior, or I die. 

While I draw this fleeting breath, 
When mine eyes shall close in death, 
When I soar to worlds unknown, 
See thee on thy judgment throne,

Let me hide myself in thee.",Rock of Ages,2007

But she's far far away
And I'd do anything just to see her face
But she's far far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

Sittin' on a plane
Reminiscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I'd make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don't wanna let go but the rain wont let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I'm sorry for the games that I played
But now it's too late

You know I really love you, this the realest goin' get
It take time to realise what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should've gave more
Now you're miles away and I'm miles on tour
Now it's drums playing, crowd singing
Light changing, wish you was here to witness all that
It starts fading
They say two wrongs don't make it right
And I was wrong and now it aint right

It's everything you say and how you say it baby

What is it about you that makes me giddy
What is it about you that makes me weak
What is it that makes me feel so damn silly

Chris Rivers,"Cry first and laugh last
Television was on, we never had Dash
And the city was flooded with mad crack
'Cause they experiment on minorities like we lab rats
Priorities, it's fuck authority
A man that can stand on his own and show maturity
I ain't ever ask for a loan, I've been supportin' me
Takin' cash from hoes like a sorority
Oh yeah they comin' for your life
I'm comin' for your life
It's bonded, I'm livin' out of spite
You ain't bleed then it wasn't worth the fight
I'm givin' y'all bread and water, ah bread and water all they get
And it ain't shakin' no hands, so fuck your politics
This isn't makin' a ?, I burn a lot of bridges down
Then I played in the ash like fuck your following
All we ever wanted was good pussy and credit scores
Their own cars is better than all our rentals are
I'm sick of y'all, dudes switchin' and gettin' hot
Like Bruce Jenner and menopause
Ain't never told us detox the senators
I say they sent us to detox the criminals
So the minute that we pop his genitals
Emilio ain't gon' ever fall, I told y'all

Everybody pressin' charges, they ain't change where I'm from
It's no game, even Ndamukong Suh
Connect try to keep me out the loop
It's canine proof, all my birds in the coop
Niggas wanna see me in the cage, but why?
My lawyer gets surprised with the money I save
I'm low like Fetty Wap's left eye
I coulda sworn I saw Left Eye at Best Buy
Nike slippers, read the paper on the milk crates
Sippin' Arizona, I got stripes like a Zebra Cake
Believe me, fast money like a relay
Shopped in SoHo when Prince Street had replays
?, I love my heritage
And fuck the race, if you real you my relative
Why so sensitive?
The revolution will be tele-vized
Excuse the grammar, I'm a ghetto kid
My grandma still alive and all 11 kids
Only my father made it, let's reminisce another time
Bought a watch with these bars to kill time
Sick in the head, now that's an ill mind
Shine like a d-d-diamond ? young
I said one day I'd have a Lambo, not a Hyundai
I kill for these stacks like Jimmy Caan
Wait let a G win like the Padres
Let a G win like Tony's last name
Who played first base for San Diego
Had to break it down
Fuck the cops, we gotta triumph
Fight for Freddie right now, it's about to be more riots
They wanna kill the youth when they need more guidance
With more violence you can only expect more defiance
It's hard to be vocal when they shoot you up and choke you
Die unexpected if the wrong one approach you
Sharpton ain't doin' enough, where's all the leaders?
Breakin' the same laws, we follow how they teach us
I never seen a thug win a million with Regis
Or a single mother from the ghetto either
Fuck y'all

It's a small island in the Caribbean that we be in
Goes by the name of Puerto Rico

Nigga the champ is here, Cassius Clay in his prime
The Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawking of rhymes
Combined with Einstein's mind and then refined like it's wine
I write divine rhymes, I fill my time by feelin' these dimes
Fill my satisfaction with valid rappin' and Magnum wrappin'
Fact I haven't felt emotions that's potent since daddy's passin'
I'm the Marilyn Manson of ? relax in baths of acid
I got True Religion jeans, if I kill you it's act of passion
I'm a dragon from ?
Aptitude is ample to pass all the rap masters
Who master it, cracking ribs
Put you in the earth, what it's worth you can act natural
The pragmatical mathematical rappin' cannibal
Who fight with animals, Bronx nigga that has an attitude
You see my avenue is compatible with a battle room
I never sold crack, just wrote dope lines to hand to you
Package that, I got the Cadillac of flows
Cataracts these hoes cause I'm soundin' like platinum gold
You never see a ghost, that's what me and my dad was told
So now I'm pickin' up the torch while these labels haggle my soul
Y'all can suck the undercuts of my nuts while I take a shit
Only spend nights, I don't gotta know what patience is
All you niggas bitches, to exist you gotta take my rent
Blow your fuckin' head off clean bro, save the witness

Latino, I'm that and I'm proud
If you don't know us, let me tell you about
Niggas that slam their dominoes loud, let you see copy
Beef copy ox cutter make his cheep choppy
Cherry coco, peña drip 'til your teeth sloppy
Hustlers become connects when they need papis
Lease a Honda, Chevy on the back block
Runnin' routes with the bow bow in the stash box
When I speak it's chop yaow, I'm a New Yorican
Calderon on the phone, I'm in ? creepin'
Y'all hangin' on resorts to just chill
I'm in the caserios take a walk down the hill
One way in, one way out, where y'all all could get killed
Leave them niggas alone, that's how the officers feel
Nigga, my people, beach, 98 gettin' our tan on
Slippers walkin' on ?, hittin' the sand strong
But plan wrong, it will transform
Wet you then find a Jet Blue out to San Juan
We don't look for parties, the party's wherever we go
Turn the corner section to the 4th of Julio
Too much to fit in one 16
So let me cook like the festival on 1/16
Mean, my career's been like one sick dream
A nightmare, scary how I does this thing
You ain't elite, I'm made of deep
God thought he was stuntin' when he created me
Rap's Bobby Fischer, nigga please take a seat
I made you in three moves: ink, paper, beat
Y'all keep playin', nigga, we play for keeps

Mit meinem Motorrad hinaus auf's Land.
Nach dem groáen Regenguá I'm Sonnenschein
Sah ich ein Mädchen stehn am Straáenrand.
Ihre Kleider klebten pitschnaá an ihr.
Ich sagte: do
Do
Do
Komm mit mir.
Dann suchte ich sofort am nächsten Ort ein Gasthaus aus
Da rief der dicke Wirt schon an der Tür:

Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Klein und gemütlich
Und es reicht für zwei
Wer's einmal kennt
Der zieht nicht gern aus
Denn da fühlt man sich zuhaus.
Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Ein gutes Frühstück ist umsonst dabei.
Und wer allein zu zwein darin wohnt
Der wird mit Liebe belohnt.
Und wir stiegen ab in diesem netten Haus
Dann schauten wir das kleine Zimmer an.
Endlich zogen wir die nassen Kleider aus
Weil man sich sonst so leicht erkälten kann.
So sah ich das Mädchen plötzlich vor mir stehn.
Und sagte: do
Do
Do
Do bist schön.
Ja und wir beide sahn am nächsten Morgen immer noch
Die Leute drauáen durch den Regen gehn.
Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Klein und gemütlich
Und es reicht für zwei
.
Sonntag Abend fuhren wir vergnügt nach Haus
Und rollten langsam in die groáe Stadt.
Ja
Und dann hielt ich vor ihrer Haustür an
Wo sie I'm Dachgeschoá ein Zimmer hat.
Ich gab ihr die Hand
Da lachte sie mich an
Und sagte: do
Do
Do
Hör doch auf.
Do warst doch schon I'm kleinen Gasthaus ganz allein mit mir
Dann komm auch hier ein biáchen mit hinauf.
Hier ist ein Zimmer frei! Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Ein gutes Frühstück ist umsonst dabei.
Und wer allein zu zwein darin wohnt
Der wird mit Liebe belohnt.

Chris Roberts,"Ich lieb' dich nun seit vielen Wochen
Doch frag' ich mich
Ob sich's lohnt.
Nachts I'm Park sitz ich neben dir
Und schau leider nur in den Mond.
Do sagst immer: Fall nicht gleich
Mit der Tür ins Haus!
Händchenhalten und Diskutieren
Das hält kein Mann lange aus:
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer
Rück noch ein Stück zu mir her!
Liebe
Die macht ja dein Leben schön
Komm her und dann wirst do es sehn:
Küssen ist gar nicht so schwer
Adam sprach: Eva
Komm her!
Wer einmal anfängt
Verlernt's nie mehr
Ja
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer!
In Romanen da liest do viel
über Männer und über Sex.
Bleib nicht nur bei der Theorie
Sonst kriegst do noch einen Komplex!
Stürz dich endlich mal mit mit
In's Vergnügen rein
Und ich schwör' dir
Nach drei Versuchen geht alles
Schon von allein:
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer
Rück noch ein Stück zu mir her
Liebe ist leichter noch als Latein
Man braucht sie
Um glücklich zu sein.
Küssen ist gar nicht so schwer
Adam sprach: Eva
Komm her!
VVer einmal anfängt
Verlernt's nie mehr
Ja
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer!
Da hilft kein Lexikon
Kein Rat per Telefon
So ein Naturtalent wie do kann das I'm Nu.
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer
Rück noch ein Stück zu mir her!
Alles wär' traurig
Dein Herz wär' schwer
Wenn heute die Liebe nicht wär'.
Küssen ist gar nicht so schwer

Ladies of Deja Vu
What must I do to get with you?
I got a role of twenties buried in my pants
So here's one little question that I'd like to ask

Can a nigga get a table dance?
Shake it up! Shake it up! Woo! Shake that thang

Shake it up! Shake it up! Woo! Shake that thang
Can a nigga get a table dance?

Shake it up! Shake it up! Woo! Shake that thang

I been workin' all week, for the money I got
Lookin' for a place to bend this nut
In attendin' in my Benzo
Lookin' for a place to find some mackin' hoes
But that shit don't thrill me
So I head to the mad city to get on, G
I don't dance just start fun
I'm lookin' for a place that gonna move some

Know what I'm sayin'? Know what I'm talkin' about?
The type of bitch that turn the party out
I met a bitch named Dynasty
With so much back, she made a blind man see
What's really happenin'?
Too many clothes, not enough booty slappin'
Now I don't need romance, all I need to know is

Can a nigga get a table dance?
Shake it up! Shake it up! Woo! Shake that thang
Can a nigga get a table dance?
Shake it up! Shake it up! Woo! Shake that thang

I'll give you a table dance
But you're white
And you're cute
This is a great table dance
Hey, you like that?
I love it!
This table dance makes me wanna
Makes me wanna sing

This is for the diamonds and the watch all clustered
Spread em like mustard, canary yellow
Now women in my face like hello
Yea I'm sort of a big deal
These Giovanni rims are sort of a big wheel
This five course dinner is sort of a big meal
This Bentley GT can make Luda disappear
Faster than David Copperfield motherfucker
I'm talking five star tell is, and penthouse suites
Yea I'm just a playboy between penthouse sheets
Hit the club and go and party with some penthouse freaks
Party with Britney, Lindsay and Paris together
Get in line and buying bottles that's taller than Chris Webber
And making haters sneeze from diamonds and sick leathers
Cause my ice gives em cold like they as if they under the weather
But my women keep me warmer than a polo sweater

Now I stay fresh to death draped in gangsta fits
Over 12 million sold I drop gangsta hits
Live in mansions and drive around in gangsta whips
You swear I'm bout to get into some gangsta shit
Oh no here comes trouble, my vision is skewed
I can only see in doubles, two models two bottles
That'll pop like bubbles and when I get home
The girls tops lift off like airspace shuttles
60 seconds till blast off
My car got a face lift and took its mask off
Tint so dark it look like I took the glass off
The body was white for 8 weeks
Before I finally decided to take its cast off
Now its blacker than a bottom less pit
You talk shit you'll end up with bottom less lip
I hit a nigga so hard, I'll make him swallow his spit
Then I be wit Bobby V on that anonymous shit

I go for broke like TLC
The hottest nigga on the mic
Yea I believe that's me
Now all the ladies wanna give a lil' TLC
Cause Luda was set for life after 3 LPs
Yep,
Still counting still climbing the charts
And rappers still talking shit
Like they was rhyming in farts
I cross the finish line twice
They still trying to start
But my infrared beam will make em shine in the dark

Chris Rodriguez,"Recruiting the ill-fated for ""The War""
A legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califarabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA
God help them

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God; the undoing of man

Promising a vapor,in the end they become one

No rules of engagement,this enemy hides
Amongst women and children

And to beat violence,you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn of the BBC, CNN
And don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!
These are your people Lady Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is ""Property of the USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton""
Surprise?
But a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe?
Guess what?
We're coming to get you!

All that you envisioned of what things will come to be

Chris Rodriguez,"The great silent mirror
Under the stars and the moon
Sounds of galloping horses
On clouds of lightning and thunder
A dark and gathering storm
To scorch the earth for many generations
A new winter, worse than any
Called the holy war

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red war horse to end all wars
A pale horse in pastilets led by
A black horse with famine at his gails

The doctrine of hatred
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The first born of the dead
A crown rider with arrows and bow
A rare rider with a great fiery sword
Lakes come from the one called death
Horror and Apocalypse follows
Moons two full horsemen ride again
Their fathers kingdom spun to kingdom come
I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name stone
Blessed are the dead

A red war horse to end all wars

Chris Rodriguez,"He said he'd try just a little bit
He didn't want to end up like them
And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder
Pounding on the door to make the next score

Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul

Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies
His cause of death, high speed on burnt ice

Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man
Memories of his family are calling after him
He can hardly thing, hardly walk
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk
With just one hit the pain would go away
But he's dead if he does

Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows",Burnt Ice,2007

I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes, and you just vanish soon as I

Trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug

Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear

The United ""Abominations"" as it were
Forged to prevent wars and froze in the face of disaster
And stood silent while terrorization took hostage of the world

In a mire of hypocrisy, the UN ignored sex crimes by its blue helmets
And enables terrorism, so, in the end, it's failed
And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back
And we pay twenty-two percent of their tab to host our enemies here at home

Enjoy diplomatic immunity living in Manhattan 
While their children are turned into prostitutes
It's a complete and utter disgrace, a blot on the face of humanity

Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full of the fat of their lands

Brought me to my knees, crying out for hope

I'm clean through no good of my own
But when You look at me You see Your Son
And I am clean

Looking back, my past is worth forgetting
But every try brings me to my knees
Where I can see the shades of Your forgiving
Each color covers a sinful memory

No one is righteous but I'm not the one You see
I'm clean, I'm covered by forgiveness here
And only You can forget all I've done

I'm clean through no good of my own
But when You look at me You see Your Son
And I am clean

You see a time of change
Don't it all feel strange'

Stuck in the reverb of me,
I hear echos of myself
But I can't say what I see.

I'm finding the answers
To my great divide

Someday when the sky is falling I will let you know
Someday when my dreams are caving in I will let you
Know
I'll let you know

Forget the first verse of life:

There's nothing learned at all 
At least until you fall.

Stratospheres and atmospheres collide,
Worlds come to an end
And there's nowhere left to hide.

Chris Sligh,"Love is a loaded gun and my trigger finger, lingers
Waiting for the right time to let this go
I know I’m not the only one who feels this
Hears this, is it a near miss?
'Cause I think it’s finally time to let my feelings show

Are good intentions as far as I can go?

Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber
Big talk but nothing’s ever changing
Take aim but never making my mark
Love can change the world
But it’s gotta start with my heart

Love is a gift of one and it’s all I can’t buy
But I’m looking for a reason I can give it now
Every single mother’s son reaches out for love from, someone
And I hold the key to breaking through the doubt

Are good intentions as far as I can go?

Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber
Big talk but nothing’s ever changing
Take aim but never making my mark
Love can change the world
But it’s gotta start with my heart

Shake, shake, can you hear the sound?
Move, move, do you feel it now?
Love, love, love is raining down
Love is raining down on me

Feels like the darkness in my head is slowly fading
While all the joy you give instead becomes engaging
Was shallow love given up too late?

I've been down on a bended knee
Talking to the Man from Galilee

He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name, and my heart stood still
When He said, ""Son, go do my will""

Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter
Tell him God Almighty's gonna cut him down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You may throw your rock, hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made day and night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light

You may run and hide, slip and slide
Try to take the mote from your neighbor's eyes
Oh yeah, as sure as God made the rich and poor
You're gonna reap just what you sow, oh, oh no

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)

Some people go to church just to signify
Trying to make a date with the neighbor's wife
Well then, let me tell you, just as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone

Think that brother has gone to work
You sneak right up, knock on that door

A living monument opposed to my success
I tried to look into his eyes as he shuffled past my car
Sweat beading on his skin, his clothes and hair a mess

As the light turned green and I pulled away
He slowly disappeared
Just a memory of another chance
I failed to show Your love here

I wanna love because You loved
I wanna give because You gave
I wanna reach my hand out to the lost

Only You can save

The struggle and the pain that others feel
Do I want to hear the stories I see echoed in their eyes?
Or is this love I say that I'm reflecting even real?

But I'm telling you your heart would soon recover
But you don't want it to, you love this aching agony
'Cause it's noble, but it's true
You won't forsake this pain for other lovers
Happiness would fill your mind with misery
Time will wound all heels, and it ain't pretty
With any luck at all, she'll find some dope that you can pity
Your loss is measured in illusions
And your gain is all in bittersweet intelligence
And your winsome smile will lose some of its innocence
Your winsome smile
Your winsome smile will lose some of its innocence",Winsome Smile,1997
Chris Smither,"The devil ain't a legend, the devil's real
In the empty way he touched me, where I hardly feel
In the empty hole inside me, the nothing that'll ride me
Down into my grave, it does not heal
Nothing is as something, it'll suck you dry
As the whisper you can hardly hear that tells you why.

They told me ""You ain't got no problems, you're self-deceived""
These seeming contradictions, well they make believe
It was then that I decided my life was being guided
By a second-rate dependence on first-class thieves
They told me I was breaking through, I was breaking down
By the time I learned the difference they had long left town.

You know that they ain't so malicious, they ain't mean
They're just vaguely well-intentioned with no love I've seen
And it's the emptiness that kills you, cold comfort that'll fill you
With a sense of dread that maybe things are worse than they seem
They don't tell you nothing you don't already know
They just keep holding out the promise but they don't let go
You know they don't let go.

Well, it was hard luck and trouble, bad times too
I know I had 'em coming, but I got through
It was advice that you gave me in a dream that saved me
You said ""Get a new life contract that spells out your dues.""
Took good will to find it, a clear conscience to sign it
Now I dream about the good times and it all comes true.",Devil's Real [Live],1998
Chris Smither,"Climb into this car,
I will take you for a ride,
We won't go very far,
But I think better here inside,
Somethin' I forgot to tell you,
Think it over, then decide.

I will make this explanation,
If you can't see it for yourself,
It's very hard to pay attention,
When you listen someplace else,
Turn off that radio,
It's like I'm talkin' to myself.

These are not petty pleasures,
It's a dance that slowly glides,
In very complicated measures,
That can't be simplified,
But if we just keep this together,
All the rest is justified.

Every step is destination,
Every moment is as long,
As it will take imagination,
To begin and end the song,
Part equals all, that's creation,
That's the sense that we belong.

It ain't easy bein' careful,
I know it's hard to take your time,
But if we think for one another,
Mine is yours, yours is mine,
Lose your sense of separation,
All the rest will fall in line.

Please believe me when I tell you,
The hardest part is to begin,
I know you think I'm crazy,
But we're halfway to the end,
And if I drive you to distraction,
I will drive you home again.",Drive You Home Again,1999
Chris Smither,"Lemme tell ya 'bout Linda Lou,
She had a big head,
She slept with her hat on,
She had a big butt too,

Yeah, I'm on my own.

Lemme tell ya 'bout Betty Jean,
She had a filthy mind, 
She worked at the car wash,
But she could not come clean,

I'm all alone.
Yeah I'm on my own.

I'm gonna get me a better one,
One with one name,

Wag her tail when I bring her bones,

I wouldn't be one if you paid me,
But it doesn't take a lot to see ,
Just where you're headed lately,
Pretty soon you're gonna ask me,
How come the life you lead, 
Doesn't make you very happy,
Or satisfy your needs,
You talk about your needs as though
You know just what they are,
When in fact to really know them,
Is like traveling to a star,
It takes so long you die along the way,
So I say hey, hey, hey.

C'mon, siddown,
Let's talk about illusion,
How everything is made of it,
No wonder life's confusin',
All this stuff we take for granted,
So solid to the touch,
Is just a concrete indication,
That we love ourselves too much,
But if we don't love ourselves, you say,
Who will? Whatever for?
I say, that's a better question
Than the one you asked before,
But the answer is still just as far away,
So I say hey, hey, hey.

Let go of all of this,
Forget about your reason, 
You can leave it all behind you,
You can start another season,
All these silly little fictions,
Are gonna take you by surprise,
When you see them in the daylight
And finally realize,
You told them to yourself,
Nobody else was listening,
You'll be standing broken-hearted,
Like a disillusioned Christian,
With your mouth open but nothin' left to say,
So just say hey, hey, hey.","Hey, Hey, Hey",1999

Chris Smither,"I don't know much, when I knew less,
And I was heartbroke for the first time,
I was drowning in my tears,
I went looking for a lifeline,
Trying to find some comfort,
A simple tender touch,
Searching for some little cure
That would not cost too much,
And I could hear that produce wagon on the street,
I could hear that farmer singing,
As I cried myself to sleep

I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound,
Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,
Beans of every kind,
If hungry is what's eatin' you
I'll sell you peace of mind,
But this ain't what you came to hear me say,
And I hate to disappoint you,
But I got no love today,
I got no love today,
I got no love today,
No love today

I could not love to save myself
From lonesome desperation.
Everything I thought was love 
Was worthless imitation.
My concept of commitment
Was to take all you could give,
I thought the cheapest thrills I loved
Were teachin' me to live,
But nothin' seemed to last or see me through
Nothin' but that little song 
That I still sing for you.

I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound,
Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,

I think you much too clever,
For your own good I will tell you
What's right before your eyes,
Intelligence is no defense 
Against what this implies,

You can't buy it off the shelf,

Well I can tell you why I love you,
You know I hardly have to try,
It came to me while I 
Was thinking over your reply,
Instead of simply takin' me for granted,
you took me by surprise and asked me why,

'Cause I used to say I love you,

Whatcha bet she wouln' lose much sleep
If I should die today
She says the love ain't cheap, but the pain is free
And I say, 'But that sounds good to me!

It's when you feel a little low
That the entire spinning universe
Descends to say hello
With heavy-handed cheerfulness
And a calculated smile and says
'Carry me awhile'
But you don't have to carry
Much of anything at all
The biggest thoughts of bigger things
Are really pretty small
The major thoughts that occupy the minor state of mind
Are what we leave behind
Just a minor thought that we can leave behind

Don't worry 'bout the future, you can't afford the price
There's madness to the method when you pay the piper
Twice once when you start to worry
Once again when you begin to take the future on the

Friend cuz nothin' that you worry over ever happens in the
End and there might be somethin' to it
But it sure gets in the way of fun today
What you say we try and have some fun today

It takes a sense of balance on this tiny little ball
With a tiny mind still big enought to think about it all

Chris Spedding,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Chris Spedding,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London [Early Band Run-Through],1981
Chris Spedding,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper. Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment, it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here",Forever Autumn [Early Version],1981

Please hold on
Ooh, somebody take a train ride
Ooh, leap on

Two train tickets into L.A.
One round trip the other way
Oh, I get the feelin' where the river falls
I get the feelin' where the river falls

Home trip, ticket to sail away
Hand grip, Hitchcock railway
Soft ride, made for comfort
Been tried, guaranteed passport

Hitchcock railway, please don't fail to pay
Hey, I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna testify
Get my soul, lift my mind

Quick stop, good day
Hitchcock railway

I'm gonna take the safe way home, oh, alright
I'm gonna ride a train back home
I'm gonna buy me a ticket at a station
Don't want to go on a train tonight

On a train tonight
On a train tonight
On a train tonight",Hitchcock Railway,1976
