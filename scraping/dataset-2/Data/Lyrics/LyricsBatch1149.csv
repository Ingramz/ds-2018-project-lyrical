The Impressions,"Hey, hey
Love, love
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Freddie's dead
That's what I said
Let the rap a plan
Said he'd see him home
But his hope was a rope
And he should've known
It's hard to understand
That there's love in this man
I'm sure all would agree
That his misery was his
Woman and things
Now Freddie's dead
That's what I said

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man
A terrible blow
But that's how it goes
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you want to be a junkie, wow
Remember Freddie's dead

We're all built up with progress
But sometimes I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But reality, what does it mean
Ain't nothing said
Cause Freddie's dead

Hey, hey
Love, love
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha
Love, love
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha
Yeah, yeah
Freddie's dead

All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl
Why I need a woman child
Don't want to be like Freddie now
Cause Freddie's dead
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
If you don't try
You're going to die

Why can't we brothers
Protect one another
No one's serious
And it makes me furious
Don't be misled
Just think of Fred

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you want to be a junkie, why
Remember Freddie's dead
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

The Impressions,"Sisters, brothers and the whities
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors

Hurry
People running from their worries
While the judge and the juries
Dictate the law that's partly flaw
Cat calling, love balling, fussing and cussing

For peace no-one is willing
Kind of make you get that feeling

Everybody smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Use the pill and the dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool
And Nixon talking about don't worry, worry, worry, worry
He says don't worry, worry, worry, worry
He says don't worry, worry, worry, worry
He says don't worry, worry, worry, worry

Your folks might understand you, by and by

And you cannot slip

Had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone

The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' ta get over

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Tryin' ta get over
Woo, Superfly 

The aim of his role
Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean?
He woudn't know
""Can't be like the rest""
Is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out
And there's no happiness

But all I do is wonder if your hair's still curled 
South of Brownsville, Texas south of Miami Beach 
But all it means to me is that you're further out of reach
Everywhere is sand and sun blue sky, water too 
I need you 

The Spanish moss is hanging and you find a polished stone 
You pocket it for luck and then you walk on alone 
They'll rent you a bicycle with the tires blown 
They'll cook you up a blackened fish and strip it to the bone

I been talking to the crew 
I need you

I go down to the library and check out all the facts

I'm wiping all my tears away so no one has a clue 
That I need you

Every man in prison thinks he's locked up for a cause

I'm gonna see if Ernest wants to go a couple rounds

I need you

Something's messed up with his wing something's messed up with my Everything

For being caught in those boys vicious games
This time I won't let you go back
Never again, my dear, in fact

I'm going to stop the blueness in you
Also confess what my heart wants me to

That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you, love me

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

Just once more you look in my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize

That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you, love me

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

The Impressions & Jerry Butler,"Your precious love means more to me
Than any love could ever be.
For when I wanted you,
I was so lonely and blue,
For that's what love will do
And darling, I'm so surprised,
Oh, when I first realized
That you were fooling me.
And darling, they say that our love won't grow.
But I just want to tell them they don't know.
For as long as you're in love with me,
Our love will grow wider,
Deeper than any sea.
And of all the things that I want,
In this whole wide world, is
Just for you to say that you'll be my girl.
Wanting you, I'm so lonely and blue.
That's what love will do.",For Your Precious Love,2006

The Incredible String Band,"Last winter blew so cold no lies,
And my fire smoke would not rise
Soon as the smoke tried to depart,
It'd be froze up harder that a landlord's heart.

I called up the police and they came around
Three days later and very brought down.
The sergeant he gave me this hysterical croak.
Says, ""What do you think you have going here, some kind of joke?""
(Of course I wasn't laughing)

He says, ""You're causing us officers so much grief,
Why don't you give us some relief?
Why don't you call the fire brigade?
Or maybe why don't you try shovelling the smoke up the chimney with a spade.""

I borrowed a spade from the woman next door,
And I broke up the smoke that remained on the floor,
I was shovelling away, till the closing day singing a smoke-shovelling song.
After working so hard I went out to my yard,
And I looked up to my chimney so long, (there was nothing to see there)
Just a thousand foot high, way into the sky,
Was a pillar of smoke full of song.

There was an airplane stuck in it,
But I didn't notice at first it was so cunningly disguised as a dragon.
Came the summer at last, though it was rainy and fast,
The pillar it melted away,
The airplane fell with a big smoky smell,
And echoing around all over the town,
Was the words of the smoke shovelling song.

And anyone think a bigger one up,
Have to be very high.",Smoke Shovelling Song,1966

In the dream hills where my childhood lay
And I'd go there in the wide long days
And my tree would listen to all that I'd say

Then one day when the world had put me in its tomb
And my life was just an empty room
I went to my tree and I sat there in my gloom
And the light was fading dimly and the sky was crying
Then my tree bent its branches low down to the ground
And its green leaves shrouded up my mind
And I left the world somewhere behind
And I didn't not know what I would find
And the sun was shining brightly and the sky was smiling

Her eyes shine moons on secret lands

As through my clouds her raven thoughts go flying
Space nearly parts and nearly joins

Well hay, the lead long sweets of loving

May she glow always in her sun

The Incredible String Band,"I wake up in the early when I see my day walk in
I wake up in the early when I start to begin
I drink up my coffee to drive dreams away
And I think about leaving but remain for the day

Oh, glory but I just stay blind
Think about my loving, yes, some of the time

I want to take it easy
Ain't it hard like they say
But I can play

And most any morning, most any morning
I like to be born into my guitar day

They say it's all butterflies
Don't let your dreams get in your eyes
But Orpheus made the sunrise
'Cause he knew how to play

Well, she sings so fadey, I called my guitar lady
She's a noted writer, I just can't seem to let her be
And she is my flower, I call her my easy hour
She's a low special, and baby that's enough for me

I got sorrow spells, I got sorrow spells
She showed up low to the blues away
And it's raining in the ocean, raining in the ocean

And stones on the mountain and just like they say
I'm just the string striker, just the lamplighter
I ain't no price fighter, it's easy to play

Well, she sings like the seashore
Tonight I don't ride on your seesaw
I will call up the angels if they have a little word to say

And I think I'll try cloud walking
It's just my face you see here talking
And it's just the guitar singing
And I have to let her have her way

And it's all right, you're in the graveyard now
And it's all right, you're in the graveyard now

You may weep, you may moan
You may pass your life so gay
But lucky in life, I swear sometimes
Surely going to have to meet your leaving day

Well, she sings like the seashore
Tonight I don't ride on your seesaw
I will call up the angels if they have a little word to say

And I think I'll try cloud walking
It's just my face you see here talking
And it's just the guitar singing
And I have to let her have her way

",Blues for the Muse,1967
The Incredible String Band,"The bent twig of darkness
Grows the petals of the morning
It shows to them the birds singing
Just behind the dawning

Come dip into the cloud cream lapping
I can't keep my hand on the plough
Because it's dying

But I will lay me down with my arms
Round a rainbow
And I will lay me down to dream

Oh, will your magic
Christmas tree be shining
Gently all around?

Climbing up these figures
The sun is tugging at my shoulder
And every step I take
I think, my feet are getting older

I see the crystal dreams unfolding
I can't keep my eyes on the book
Because it's mouldering

But I will lay me down with my arms
Round a rainbow
And I will lay me down to dream

Oh, will your magic
Christmas tree be shining
Gently all around?

So just like the morning
The ghost of the following day

Rear the rollers wild and stormy
Echoes wholly only lonely long beforey, ory ory

All rivalry and opinion still cast their wild spells
Effort and contrariness change the directions of time
The lion still growls in your hollowness
Please let's be easy, please let's be friends

Till out of the morning is growing the strength of the day

The Incredible String Band,"Gently tender falls the rain
Washing clean the slate again
But leave me please, behind my brain
This light doesn't shadow on her

Shadows dancing through the pink milk blankets
Where my mind lay dreaming gently of my loving you
Sometimes I think I was true
But then I loved the stone beneath my feet as much, usually

Gently tender snow-drop grows
See the past tense quietly go
Kill the chord but let me know
This light doesn't shadow on her

Shadows dancing through the green bush trees
Where my toes crept breathing lightly of my loving you
Sometimes I think I was true
But then I loved the stone beneath my feet as much, usually

Slowly spitting crawls the snake
See the branches bend and break
Venom that might easily shake
This light doesn't shadow on her

Good, good loving, she gave me good loving
Good, good loving, she gave me good loving
Good, good loving, she gave me good
And now all my wine is water
To her all my wine is water
All water, and my pearls are clear

Good, good loving, she gave me good
And now all my wine is water

Running down the aisle,

The Incredible String Band,"The Mad Hatter's Song Lyrics
Oh seekers of spring how could you not find contentment
In a time of riddling reasons in this land of the blind 
By the joke of fate alone
It's sure that as the loved hand leaves you,
You clutch for the slip-stream, the realness to find.
But do what you like, do what you like, do what you like,
Do what you like, do what you like, do what you can,
Do what you can, live till you die
My poor little man.
For Jesus will stretch out his hand no more.
But in the south there's many a waving tree;
Oh would that musky fingers move your pain;
In the warm south winds the lost flowers bloom again.
And if you cried, you know you'd fill a lake with tears,
Still wouldn't turn back the years,
Since the city has took you,
Mad Hatter is on my mind.
So sad, sad to see the way it grew
Those other people that I knew
That have either fell or faltered.
Mad Hatter is on my mind.
And you must have to see clear some time.
Prometheus the problem child,
Still juggling with his brains
Gives his limping leopard's visions
To the miser in his veins.
Within the ruined factory is the normal soul insane
As he sets the sky beneath his heel
And learns away the pain.
But I am the archer the lover of laughter,
And mine is the arrowed flight.
I am the archer, and my eyes yearn after the unsullied sight.
Born of the dark waters of the daughters of night,
Dancing without movement after the clear light.
Oh Perithian fate be kind in the rumbling and trundling rickshaw of time.
Hooked by the heart to the king fisher's line,
I will set my one eye for the shores of the blind.

All life must turn to me
Oh, cannot you see?
And you must come with me
You must come with me

I'll give you gold and jewels rare
And all my wealth in store
All pleasure's fair
If I may live but a few short years more

No more to glory in your pride
Tarrying here there is no way
Your time has come that you must away
And you must come to clay

Rains rot the rafters and do you just have to snore?
It's a most inclement climate, for the season of the night
Is that mouse playing football, oh, I thought they didn't like the light?

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

There's mayhem in this mansion, since the cows were coming home
With delirium no sleep um, in a cloud of nylon foam
But release scours the outhouse and a hard rain sears the sky
But if you let the pigs decide it, they will put you in the sty

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

I think I'll get a picture and I think I'll put it on a nail
I think I'll get another one and put it in a pail
But the pail got so rusty I called it red, red, red for fun
And I laughed like a leaver till you ought to seen it run

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and if I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

The size of the future declared itself no part
Aloof like a Sultan in the autumn of your heart
But the heart got so hearty, that it pulled for the shore
And the sailors fired a big salute and it made my ears quite sore

And the dawn was sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking
I am starting to grieve, man, I used to know but now I believe, man
They tell me sleep is a gas and I want to lay down
But I'm sorry I woke you, I mean I've got the no sleep blues

I mixed stones and water, just to see what it would do
And the water it got stoney and the stones got watery too
So I mixed my feet with water, just to see what could be seen
And the water it got dirty and the feet they got quite clean

And the dawn comes sneaking up when it thinks I'm not looking

Leaving just a trace of twilight sleep
I whisper to the baby raindrops playing on my window
And tell them gently this is not the time that they should weep

For somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

My Friday evening's footsteps plodding dully through this black town
Are far away now from the world that I'm in
My eyes are listening to some sounds that I think just might be springtime
With daffodils between my toes I'm laughing at their whim

And somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

Oh, somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

The purple sail above me catches all the strength of summer
Fishes stop and ask me where I am bound
I smile and shake my head and say my little ship is sinking
But I kind of like the sea that I'm on and I don't mind if I do drown

And somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there, it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you

Read your book and lose yourself
In another's thoughts.
He might tell you 'bout what is

Or even 'bout what is not.
And if he's kind and gentle too,
And he loves the world a lot,
His twilight words may melt the slush

Of what you have been taught.
You know what you could be.
Tell me my friend,
Why you worry all the time

What you should been.
Listen to the song of life.
Its rainbow's end won't hold you.
Its crimson shapes and purple sounds,

Softly will enfold you.
It gurgles through the timeless glade,
In quartertone's of lightning.
No policy is up for sale,

In case the truth be frightening.
You know what you could be.

Why you worry all the time

Your army's trying so very hard
To find for me a goal

Where there's time for me to be
Nothing else but what I am
That's what you seem scared to see

You cover up your emptiness
With brick and noise and rush
Oh, I can see and touch you
But you don't owe reality much

Have mercy I cry city, you're all upon my mind
And sometimes I think you keep forgettin'
That you don't know me

Oh, send another carriage
Chugging down your chokey tube
I hope it makes you happy
'Cause it don't do my health much good

Now squeeze the lemon in my head
Make me know just what it's like
For a sin drenched Christian to be dead

Ah, show to me your glitter
And your flashing neon light
You see, I think that only the sun knows
How to be quietly bright

Have mercy I cry city, you're all upon my mind
That sometimes I think you keep forgettin'
That you don't know me

All these years, what you been doin'?
Who would believe that what you been doin'
Would make such a ruin of you?

At two lost eyebrows lisping into the unexpected
And the archetypal postman delivering your seed letters
Whose eyes are black eggs really
Upon a long shore, upon a long shore
Open your door, open your door

“Ask anyone”, he muttered, as he spat a small
Brilliant blue insect, whirring into the gauze
I would advise stilts for the quagmires
And camels for the snowy hills and any survivors
Their debts I will certainly pay
There's always a way, there's always a way

I smiled with that gallantly concealed forceful nervousness
That has proved that oysters cry
And that I have come to know and accept as myself
And plucking a barbed feather from the morose universe
I called him deathless, and he left before he could reply
Open your eyes, open your eyes

Our first father, Abraham, whose bosom
Was the unique soul of the humans
Was certainly as bewildered as we are
If not infinitely more so, and with an ancient
Ceremonial gesture of dismissal, he pointed forward

Verily, verily
Verily, verily
Verily, verily
Verily, verily

The first day was golden
And she colored the Sun
And she named it Hyperion
And she made it a day of light and healing

The second was silver
And she colored the Moon
And she named it Phoebe
And she made a day of enchantment and the living waters

And the third was many-colored
And she colored the Earth
And she made a day of joy
With the scarlet strength of seed

In the fourth black and white were mingled into quicksilver
And she colored Mercury
And she made a day of wisdom
And the signs that are placed in the firmament

The fifth was bright blue
And she envisaged Jupiter
And she made a day of awe and circles, circles
And she sent it to guide the blood of the universe

The sixth was burning with icy, green flames that glowed white
And of her beauty she made Venus
And she made a day of love
Whereby all beings are united

The seventh was rich purple of the mollusks
And she colored Chronos
And she made a day of idleness and repose
Whereon all beings cease from struggle

I am the pebble in your very own eye
I am the sword and your enemy dies
I am the storm and the hurricane wind
I am the thorn of an unkind friend

I am desire what color my eyes?
I am Loki, wizard of lies
Catch me, find me, see me if you can
I am the guilt of an honest man

I am the pebble in your very own eye
I am the sword and your enemy dies
I am the storm and the hurricane wind
I am the thorn of an unkind friend

I am desire what color my eyes?
I am Loki, wizard of lies
Catch me, find me, see me if you can
I am the guilt of an honest man

Then seven times we raised our arms
And with cat-stretch
Sent our foot spells
Yawning into the multitudes

In need we called upon the mother of all living
Three times for succor, but with ambitious spears
They made us change, they crouched behind
Their mirrors and fought on

I will not allow them praise
That broke the harmonious globe in splintered fragments
And yet, they moved perforce with a perfect pattern
And complemented harmony with discord, and light with darkness

It was then
That we stepped out of our world machine
Between the palm and the fingers
Peeling like gloves

And for each eye that shed one tear
We made of that tear an ocean
And in the five directions
We loosed our several craft

Wild sea, I say today
Please, be a sweet cow for me
Amethyst galleon, out on the rolling sea

Gentle as lightning, easily
Take me to the root of the world tree
Amethyst galleon, out on the rolling sea

Your face is consumed in a bruised sky's glance
By the brazen wall with your sword and lance
Where [Incomprehensible]
Where dappled maidens, endless danced
'Round the root of the world tree

Wild sea, I say today
Please, be a sweet cow for me
Amethyst galleon, out on the rolling sea
[Incomprehensible]

Wild sea, my love is salty for me
Every ripple in her body is a wave in me
Amethyst galleon, out on the rolling sea

Hold tight, sleep tight
[Incomprehensible]

But one day walking by the river
I met a tollman with an angry face
And many's the time I passed through his tollgate
And paid no silver and paid no fee
But rather I did hide my sheep and goats under the bags of oatmeal
And cold I was, no crown did I wear

Why don't you look down to the basement
And sitting very quietly there is a man who has no head

And the streets are his and all the people
And even the temples and the whole world
And many's the time he walks to the river

For he sees that their faces are none but his own

Just to make a dream come true

Forgotten everything my mother knew
The day is young and spring is sprung and I'm waiting for you
Must you bring that horse in here Miss Jones
(although your snowshoes do look terrific)
Yes they all come from out of the sky you know
I'm waiting for the dove that never came home
I'm waiting for the painter when his colours were gone
I'm waiting for the soldiers at the war, I'm waiting for a royal decision
I'm waiting for the sun to snore
I'm waiting for a rumble from Jericho, waiting for the world to begin

I'm a turnip head, I'm a lately wed and I'm waiting for you

I'm wailing for the angels to put on their smiles
I'm waiting for the judges to come to trial
I'm waiting for the aeroplane, I'm waiting for the graves to open
I'm waiting to be sold in chains
I'm waiting for a signal from the trapdoor queen
Waiting for the world to begin

When men did speed to pray
Along the road of discontent to gods of gold and clay

Among the seas of change
And some did seek dear life to wound
A furious time and strange

Beautiful beyond your dreams

Just look around and notice what you see

But when I see what we have made
What we have out with the mind's blade

Beneath some shaded planet 
Before this earth was born
We came together

And we danced in the early dawn
For my hands contain ten dances
That shall bear us into the night
Into the sea

And the moon's morning light
Night mimed a bow
And broke into the day
Fair sailors and their cautious friends

Smiled on the sea
That reflected all their gazes
And danced with the air
The breezes filled the sails

High against the quay
High on the limpid waves the ship it did fly
Rising as a condor into the silvery sky
Passing through the arches that begin his earth

The sailors saw the scenic air
As air gave Earth it's birth
Gazing ahead towards today
They saw the fields of this world

They watched the first new dancers
As their bodies did unfurl.",Sailor and the Dancer,1994

Won't you lay your head upon your saviors breast?

Who would lose and who would bruise
Or who would live quite prettily?
And who would love what comes along
And fill the air with joyous song

Who would go and who would come
Or who would simply linger?
And who would hide behind your chair
And steal your crystallized ginger?

Nebulous nearnesses cry to me
At this timeless moment someone dear to me
Wants me near, makes me high
I can hear vibrations fly

Through mangoes, pomegranates and planes
All the same
When it reaches me and teaches me
To sigh

Who would mouse and who would lion
Or who would be the tamer?
And who would hear directions clear
From the unnameable namer?

Who would skip and who would plot
Or who would lie quite stilly?
And who would ride backwards on a giraffe?
Stopping every so often to laugh

Amoebas are very small

Oh ah ee oo
There's absolutely no strife
Living the timeless life, I don't need a wife
Living the timeless life

If I need a friend I just give a wriggle
Split right down the middle
And when I look there's two of me
Both as handsome as can be

Oh, here we go slithering, here we go
Slithering and squelching on
Oh, here we go slithering, here we go
Slithering and squelching on

Oh ah ee oo
There's absolutely no strife
Living the timeless life

Black hair, brown hair feather and scale
Seed and stamen and all unnamed lives that live
Turn your quivering nerves in my direction
Turn your quivering nerves in my direction
Feel the energy projection of my cells wishes you well

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide you all the way on

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide you all the way on

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide you all the way on

The Incredible String Band,"First girl I loved
Time has come I will sing the sad goodbye song
When I was seventeen, I used to know you
And I haven't seen you now in so many years
And the last time I saw you
You said you joined the Church of Jesus
But me I remember your long red hair
Falling in our faces as I kissed you

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With a house and car and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I wouldn't be here at all

Well we parted so hard
Me rushing 'round New York with a guitar
Making love to people I didn't even like to see
And I still sometimes think of you
As I lay here in the six at morning
And in the lonely midnight
I've got to hold your face before me

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With kids and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I'd just have to fall

And I never slept with you
Though we must have made love a thousand times
'Cause we were just young
Didn't have no place to go

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
So its goodbye, first love
And I hope you're fine
I have a sweet woman
Maybe someday she`ll have babies by me

She`s a true friend of mine",First Girl I Loved,1994
The Incredible String Band,"The Half-Remarkable Question Lyrics
Who moved the black castle 
Who moved the white queen
When Gimmel and Daleth where standing between?

Out of the evening growing a veil
Pining for the pine woods that ached for the sail
There's something forgotten I want you to know
The freckles of rain are telling me so

O it's the old forgotten question 
What is that we are part of?
What is it that we are?
And an elephant madness has covered the sun

The judge and the juries they play for the fun
They've torn up the roses and washed all the soap
And the martyr who marries them dares not elope
O it's the never realised question

O long O long e're yet my eyes
Braved the gates enormous fire
And the body folded 'round me
And the person in me grew

The flower and its petal
The root and its grasp
The earth and its bigness
The breath and its gasp

The mind and its motion
The foot and its move
The life and its pattern
The heart and its love

O it's the half-remarkable question.",The Half Remarkable Question,1994
The Incredible String Band,"I'll sing you this October song,
Oh, there is no song before it.
The words and tune are none of my own,
for my joys and sorrows bore it.

Beside the sea
The brambly briars, in the still of evening,
Birds fly out behind the sun,
and with them I'll be leaving.

The fallen leaves that jewel the ground,
They know the art of dying,
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts,
In the scarlet shadows lying.

When hunger calls my footsteps home,
The morning follows after,
I swim the seas within my mind,
And the pine-trees laugh green laughter.

I used to search for happiness,
And I used to follow pleasure,
But I found a door behind my mind,
And that's the greatest treasure.

For rulers like to lay down laws,
And rebels like to break them,
And the poor priests like to walk in chains,
And God likes to forsake them.

I met a man whose name was Time,
And he said, ""I must be going,""
But just how long ago that was,
I have no way of knowing.

Sometimes I want to murder time,
Sometimes when my heart's aching,
But mostly I just stroll along,
The path that he is taking.",October Song,1994

Yes, you made your own amusements then,
For going to the pictures;
Well, the travel was hard, and I mean
We still used the wheel.

And eat a real food meal.

But hey, you young people, well I just do not know,
And I can't even understand you
When you try to talk slow.

There was one fellow singing in those days,
And he was quite good, and I mean to say that
His name was Bob Dylan, and I used to do gigs too
Before I made my first million.
That was way, way back before,
Before wild World War Three,
When England went missing,
And we moved to Paraguayee.

But hey, you young people, I just do not know,
And I can't even understand you
When you try to talk slow.

Well, I got a secret, and don't give us away.
I got some real food tins for my 91st birthday,
And your grandmother bought them
Way down in the new antique food store,
And for beans and for bacon, I will open up my door.

And when the music starts to play let me be around, (I said)
When the music starts to play let me be around.

Oh, can't you see how my heart soars high,
When I hear that music.
When the music starts to play let me be around.

When sadness lays his cold fist on my shoulder,
And pushes me in icy waters drowning,
The gentle hand of music lifts me smiling,
And through these sounds my heart takes bounds,
I happy am.

Who among you has not laid his head
Beneath some holy awning
Would think that such a night of tortured travelling

Could bring such a glory morning
And feel his heart sucked to his head
His head so wide that all life says
Has room to live and breathe and have its being - and more

For such a scene of beauty 
For such a scene of beauty 
Encompasses
See the white bird on the water

In beauty calm and still
White bird, white bird, white bird

See he watches the white bird
Of the morning
White bird, white bird, 

See he watches the white bird
Of the morning
White bird, white bird, 
Warm in his ecstasy

A shimmering gentle backward fall
He leaves his body there so small and mirror black against the sun
With deities for strength
He sees his body wracked with pain

And hears his voice so stained with sadness deep
It asks the day to weep away
Loved her so strong now
She is gone

My heart will break for ever
Sun and moon change around
Me the games seem so strange
Walk in the light

I shall never
Walk in the light
I will never

Speak to me with your beauty 

Oh white bird of the morning
Oh he cried Oh he cried
But stopped 
Short

Seeing not water but ice
Death not life
Dead white bird dead white bird
Walking onward every day

Sunshine in our faces
Sun knows what goes on below
But still our faces graces

No disgraces
No distastes
Nothing wasted at all

Over many a wild high mountain
And they did say that saw him go

All in the morning early
Until he spied his lady fair
Cold and wet and weary

Why did you leave your house and land
Why did you leave your baby
Why did you leave your own wedded lord
To go with the Black Jack Davy

What care I for your goose feather bed
With the sheets turned down so bravely
Well I may sleep on the cold hard ground
Along with the Black Jack Davy

Made of the Spanish leather
And I'll put on my lowland brogues
And skip it o'er the heather

Everything washes away in the fucking rain, everything

As the calmness fades away
And the storm clouds roll in
I sit here all alone confused by my sins
Blood drying on my hands it's really nothing new
The betrayal that I felt because I loved you
And I sit here all alone in the dark
Heart pounding filled with pain (oh the pain)
And I put the razor to her neck
Slash out she screams in vain
And she knew what I was gonna do
No way to identify her now that I'm through
But I swear she knew what I was gonna do
Oh Lord my love it was true, so true

The Indians,"Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment, this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed as I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
It's own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is, baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well, I'm so far away each step that I take
Is on my way home, a king's ransom in dimes
I'd given each night just to see through this pay phone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
'Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah but I laughed so hard I think I died

When you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone but you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

You are in my arms

And stole a kiss in every street café

You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree

As if the mayor had offered me the key to Paris

The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chime
You loved me, once upon a summertime

The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.

But she does the best that she can.

There's a hole in Tiger mountain

But she had unfaithful ways
You know she made me feel unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave

I caught her out one Sunday morning
With a man they call Big Dave
Meanest man in Waycross, Georgia
Rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave

I called her down, both her and Davey
Said I'm gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me, until I shot them
Put their cheatin', schemin' bones in Miller's Cave

You know she made me feel unwanted

The International Submarine Band,"How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

Once I was waitin'
In fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game 

Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind 

Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold

The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt

But one thing's for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind

How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind 
",A Satisfied Mind,1968
The International Submarine Band,"Sometimes I get up sad when people treat me bad
I don't have time to think and so I get real mad
I pull my hair and find somewhere that I can be alone
But when I do I think of you and then I hurry home

Where I've got chores to keep me busy
A clock to keep my time
A pretty girl to love me
With the same last name as mine
And when the flowers wilt
A big old quilt to keep us warm
I've got the sun to see your blue eyes
And tonight you're in my arms

Somtimes I get on wild when fancy cars drive fast
Money don't get me down but I can't make it last
I bite my nails and if that fails I go get myself stoned
But when I do I think of you and head myself back home

Where I've got chores to keep me busy
A clock to keep my time
A pretty girl to love me
With the same last name as mine

I took all the love they offered me with ease
And it didn't make much difference if they loved me or not
'Cause I'd love them for a while then I'd leave

Yeah and I can't believe it's really me, hurting like I do
Just because you've left me all alone
I've seen it happen many times 
To other guys I knew
Surely I must be somebody else you've known

Well when I first met you, darling 
You impressed me more than some

The International Submarine Band,"Way down south in the state of Georgia
Through the swaps and Everglades
There's a hole in Plager Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave

I had a girl in Waycross, Georgia
But she had unfaithful ways
You know she made me feel unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave

I caught her out one Sunday morning
With a man they called Big Dave
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave

I called her down both her and David
Said I'm gonna see you in your grave
The laughed at me until I shot um
I took their cheating scheming bones to Miller's Cave

You know she made me feel unwanted
But I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the State of Georgia
They'll never find me 'cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave",Miller's Cave,2001
The Internationals,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Go your own way, don't think twice about me
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own
So long darling, I'll miss you, believe me

but I know that I'll survive

You shouldn't expect an answer

By any chance, as it stands, that you still want me
I'll be in the same state you left me in

With hope we seek true happiness
Throughout our lives with
Trials we face bring pain and sorrow, but resistance is sires strength
The easy path rarely leads to what our heart truly desires
In this life we must face many a worthy challenge for the outcome to satisfy us
To win inspite of struggle implies much greater magnification
To one's honor which I value more than instant-gratification
So believe me when I say that time can heal most any wound
And ease most pain, yet the scars remain 'til the day we lay in tomb
So please know nothing in this moment is the same as a moment ago

That Margaret sewed in
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain
'Til Margaret comes to take him home again
Through unforgiving streets

Bound for the boston state

I shipped out on a glouster smack
And fished the georges bank

And the wages fare

As good as any man

Id live in my home land

Have you changed since I've been gone

And go to sea no more

last night as I lay dreaming
I sailed the raging foam
My ship she took me far away
To the rocky shores of home

and I could write a thousand lines
To say just how I feel
I hope and pray that some fine day
My dreams they can be real

But a bachelor is easy and he's free.
But I've lots to look after, though I'm living all alone.
Sure nobody's looking after me.
My father often tells me I should go and have a try
To find a girl that owns a bit of land.
And I know, the way he says it, that there's someone on his mind.
And my mother has the whole thing planned.
I don't know, maybe so,
But t'would mollify them greatly to agree.
Now, there's little Bridget Flynn, sure it's her I'd love to win,
But she never has an eye for me.
Now there's a little girl who's worth her weight in gold.
And that's a decent dowry, don't you see?
And I mean to go and ask her just as soon as I get bold,
If she'll come and have an eye for me.
Will she go? I don't know.

And a bonnie wee girl for your wife

On the hills and the glens and the valleys
Grows the softest of women so fine
And the flowers are all dripping with honey
There lives Martha, a true love of mine

Bonnie Martha, you're the first girl I courted
You're the one put my heart in a snare
And if ever I should lose you to another
I will leave my Kellswater so fair
For this one and that one may court her
But no other can take her from me
For I love her as I love my Kellswater
Like the primrose is loved by the bee

Here's a health to you, bonnie Kellswater
For its there you'll find the pleasures of life
And its there you'll find a fishing and farming

The Irish Rovers,"Goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

In the days when I was courting, I was never tired resorting
To the alehouse and the playhouse, and the other house besides.
But I told my brother Seamus, ""I'll be off now and grow famous
And before that I return again, I'll roam the whole world wide.""

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

Well, I've courted girls in Blarney, in Antrim and Killarney,
In Dublin and in Kerry, down to the coves of Cork.
But I'm tired of all this pleasure, so now I'll take my leisure.
And the next time that you hear from me, I'll write you from new York.

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

When I landed in America, I met a man named Burke.
He told me if I'd stay a while, he'd surely find me work.
But work he didn't find me, so there's nothing here to bind me.
I'm bound for San Francisco, in Califor-ni-yay!

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

Well, I'm now in San Francisco, and my fortune it is made.
My pockets loaded down with gold, I'll throw away my spade.
I'll go back to dear old Erin, spend my fortune never carin'.
I'll marry Queen Victori', Mrs. Durkin for to spite.

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.

   Why must my poor heart be following you

The Irish Rovers,"Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Oh my father was an Ulsterman, proud Protestant was he
My mother was a Catholic girl, from County Cork was she
They were married in two churches, lived happily enough
Until the day that I was born and things got rather tough

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Baptised by father Reilly, I was rushed away by car
To be made a little orangeman, my father's shining star
I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that
To my father I was William while my mother called me Pat

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

With mother every Sunday to mass I'd proudly stroll
Then after that the orange lads would try to save my soul
For both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because
I played the flute or played the harp, depending where I was

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

One day my ma's relations came round to visit me
Just as my father's kinfolk were all sittin' down to tea
We tried to smooth things over, but they all began to fight
And me being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Now my parents never could agree about my type of school
My learning was all done at home, that's why I'm such a fool
They both passed on, god rest them, but left me caught between
That awful color problem of the orange and the green

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Yes it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green",The Orange and the Green,1981

The Isaacs,"A helpless man blind from birth
The only one who saw his worth
Didn't pass him by, He heard his cry

He rubbed his eyes with a handful of clay
Then He said, ""Go wash in the pool today""
And the blind man knew that's what he had to do

You know along the way
He couldn't help but trip and fall
Each time he got back up
I wonder if he thought

Every step I take is a step in faith
When I can't see what's in front of me
I'll walk on and just believe
He hears my prayer

And when I get there
The miracle promised by my father
Is waiting in the water

I've walked in darkness, I won't lie
Just like that blind man sometimes
I've felt all alone, like all hope was gone

I know that His word is true
And no matter what I'm going through
He promised me that He would never leave

I know along the way
I may stumble and I may fall
But I'll make it to the water
Even if I have have to crawl

Every step I take is a step of faith
When I can't see what's in front of me
I'll walk on and just believe
He hears my prayer

And when I get there
The miracle promised by my father
Is waiting in the water

I know He knows where I am
And somehow this is all in His plan
So until my healing comes
I'll keep pressing on

Every step I take is a step of faith
When I can't see what's in front of me
I'll walk on and just believe

The Isaacs,"He lies awake there all alone most every night
Looking back on all of his mistakes
Wishing through the tears that he could just go back
'Cause there's a lot of things he'd like to change
He just can't forgive himself and forget
Even though God already did

If He can love someone and find the good within
In spite of what they've done, no matter where they've been
If He can let it go and set the debtor free
If He can keep forgiving you and me
Why can't we

There've been times I've been so hurt by someone else
I didn't wanna give a second chance
I let all the bitterness take control
And took grace into my own hands
But even Jesus said, ""Whoever's done no wrong
Let him throw the first stone""

If He can love someone and find the good within
In spite of what they've done, no matter where they've been
If He can let it go and set the debtor free
If He can keep forgiving you and me
Why can't we

He was hated and rejected, betrayed by those He trusted
Even hanging on the cross, He said, ""Father, please forgive them""

In spite of what they've done, no matter where they've been

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

When I've been nothing but good to him
Forsaking all others
Giving my love to him
Who could ever doubt my love?

Instead of believing me
He believed his friends

Rearrange my life to please only him
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

I've been cast aside
Because he believed someone's lies
After I've done the best I could
Still I've been so misunderstood
After I've been good to him
Good to him, so good to him

The Isley Brothers,"I was once out strolling,
One hot summer day.
When I thought I'd lay,
Myself down to rest.

In a big field,
Of tall grass,
I lay there in the sun and I,
Felt it caressin' my face.

As I fell asleep,
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star,
Of the movie.

This really blew my mind,
But there I was,
Oh yeah I was.
I was taken to the place,
The hall of the mountain king.

I stood high upon the mountaintop,
Naked to the world.
In front of me,
Was every kind of girl.

There was long ones, tall ones,
Short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones,
Big crazy ones.

Out of the middle,
Came a lady.
She whispered in my ear,
Somethin' crazy...

[Chorus]
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

I thought to myself,
What could this mean?
Am I going crazy,
Or is it just a dream?

Now wait a minute...

I know I'm lying,
In a field of grass somewhere.
It was all in my head.
But then I heard,
Somebody say...

[Chorus]

I could feel hot flames,
Of fire roaring at my back,
As she disappeared.
But soon she returned.

In her hand was a bottle of wine,
And in the other, a glass,
Good god.

She poured some of that wine,
From the bottle into the glass.
And she raised it to her lip,
And before she drank it, she said...

[Chorus]

Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on and take that pearl.

Spill that wine!

Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.

Than with you, loving you, well, well, well

Sad to see a new horizon slowly comin' into view

All that I'm givin' is for the love of you, alright now

That touches me when the mornin' comes
Feels good to me

Blowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be, well

Enchanted with your touch it seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

You're the key, well and this I see, oh I see
Now I'm there and I lose my way
Usin' words to try to say what I feel that love is real
Oh, love is real

I might as well sign my name on a card
Which could say it better, time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done
Just about all that I can do

I know that I'm livin' for the love, love of you

I two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny.
So I called her mother's house and asked has she seen my baby.
Roll my six around lookin' for that missing lady.
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused.
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I thought I heard a squicky sound,
Somethings going on upstairs
And I know nobody else lives here
""bump bump bump"" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear
Then I hear my babies voice in my ear screamin out

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
(and I heard an other man said) sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(And I just can't believe this shit)

I ran downstairs looked in the closet lookin' for that ooo,
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' ""not in my own damn house"".
Who would have thought she was creepin' wit another man?
The down low happenin' to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I know I heard a squicky sound,
Something going on upstairs cause I know no one else lives here

About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet!

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do if your son was at home

The Iveys,"The wind, it whispered coldness on the window
The headlights showed the darkness through the rain
When silhouetted there against the roadside
Was a girl who I'd learned to love that very day

She came out of the cold
Would I ever hold the girl from the cold?
She came out of the cold
We laughed and talked together on the way

I knew then I'd be foolish not to say
""I'd like to see you here again tomorrow""
As we stopped outside her house, I said ""goodnight""
She came out of the cold

Tomorrow, she's mine to have and to hold
She came out of the cold
Excitedly, the next night I arrived there
Asked the mother, was her daughter there inside?

The tears flowed from her eyes
She sadly told me, ""a year ago last night, my baby died""
She came out of the cold
Oh, how I wish I was never told
She came out of the cold",She Came Out of the Cold,2003

Maybe tomorrow, I will love again

High against where the rivers are flowing
I didn't think that our love had grown

You had me dead to rights

How you been, you looking back
You tried to change your burning boat
Until you realized what you were up against

I spent all those nights
Just trying to take you home
'Til you released me

Cross the bridge
To redefine your pain
The the answer is in your heart

Wide awake
I rearrange the way I listen in the dark
Dreaming of starting up again

So if you look, you'll find yourself
You're not the demon in the dark
That you and I, yea we'd been through that

Can you rectify
All the time it took you
Away from choosing?

So as you find yourself flying high up there
When you release me from your heart again (woo!)
I'm just a burning man trying to keep the ship
From turning over again
Cross the rich derivative of pain
Crush the burning in your heart

Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
